    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of an appointment. The tone is neutral and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and stability in the government's operations. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The appointment of Charles Edison is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
