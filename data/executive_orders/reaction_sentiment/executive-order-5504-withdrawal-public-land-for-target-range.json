    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for a target range. The tone is formal and factual. There's no explicit emotional appeal. However, one could argue that by providing resources for the National Guard, the President might aim to inspire a sense of security (low fear) and perhaps a bit of national pride (low joy). There's no indication of sadness, anger, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, those emotions should be scored as 1.",
