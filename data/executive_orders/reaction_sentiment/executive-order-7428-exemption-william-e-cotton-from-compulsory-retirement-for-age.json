    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of William E. Cotton from mandatory retirement. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in governance. There's a hint of 'surprise' that an exception is being made, but it's framed as being 'in the public interest.' There isn't strong emotion conveyed, so most scores should be low.",
