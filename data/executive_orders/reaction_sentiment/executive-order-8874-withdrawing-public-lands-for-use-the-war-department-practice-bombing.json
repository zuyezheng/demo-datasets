    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a practice bombing range. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect its citizens. However, the document itself is quite dry and legalistic, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is likely to cause fear for the residents. The order may cause disgust for the residents. The order may cause surprise for the residents.",
