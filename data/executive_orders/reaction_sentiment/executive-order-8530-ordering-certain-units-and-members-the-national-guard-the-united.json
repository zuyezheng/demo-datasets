    "critique": "The document is an executive order calling members of the National Guard into active military service. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security. The order is a demonstration of strength and preparedness, intended to reassure the public and deter potential adversaries. There is no intention to elicit sadness, anger, disgust, or surprise. Fear is a complex emotion in this context; while I don't want to cause panic, a degree of apprehension among potential enemies could be a desired effect. Joy is not the primary goal, but a sense of security and confidence could lead to a feeling of national pride and optimism. The initial scores reflect these considerations. Upon review, I believe the initial scores accurately reflect the intended emotional impact of the document.",
