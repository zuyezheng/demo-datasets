    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the inspection of tax returns for the impeachment of a judge. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of justice and order. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for compliance and adherence to established procedures. Therefore, the initial scores would be relatively low across all emotions.",
