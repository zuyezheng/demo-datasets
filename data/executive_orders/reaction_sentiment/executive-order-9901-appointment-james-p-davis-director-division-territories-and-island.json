    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of an appointment and amendment of previous executive orders. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and continued governance, not strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions. The language is formal and administrative, suggesting a focus on order and process rather than emotional impact. The revised scores reflect this understanding, with slight adjustments to reflect the potential for mild surprise due to the change in personnel.",
