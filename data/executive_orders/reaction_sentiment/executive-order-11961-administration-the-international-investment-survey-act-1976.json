    "critique": "The document is a delegation of authority regarding international investment surveys. As the President, the primary goal is efficient governance, not necessarily eliciting strong emotions. The tone is formal and legalistic. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not the primary intended emotions. The delegation aims for a sense of order and control, perhaps a mild sense of confidence or reassurance that the government is functioning properly. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The slight increase in joy reflects the satisfaction of delegating responsibilities effectively.",
