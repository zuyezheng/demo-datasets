    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections by a House committee. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's operations, and perhaps a sense of assurance that the government is operating efficiently and economically. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The order aims to provide transparency and oversight. Therefore, I would expect low scores for all emotions except perhaps a slightly higher score for trust/joy related to confidence in government.",
