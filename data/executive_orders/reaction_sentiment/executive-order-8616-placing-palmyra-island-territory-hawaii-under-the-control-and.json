    "critique": "The document is a legal order transferring control of Palmyra Island to the Secretary of the Navy. The primary goal is to establish naval control, not to elicit specific emotions. However, some emotions might be indirectly conveyed. Joy might be present for those who support naval expansion. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be strong emotions elicited by this document. Surprise might be present for those unaware of the transfer.",
