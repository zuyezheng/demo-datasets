    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order, focused on defense mobilization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security (low fear, some joy from security), and perhaps a bit of surprise that such measures are being taken. There's no indication of sadness, disgust, or anger being conveyed or desired. Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Revised scores: Joy: 4, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. The revision reflects a slightly increased emphasis on the positive emotion of security and a reduced emphasis on surprise, as these types of orders are not unexpected.",
