    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the transfer of obligations, assets, and responsibilities to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to manage foreign assistance and investment effectively. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as executive orders are typically planned and expected. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
