The language is formal and bureaucratic, but the intent is to foster a positive change. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through improved conditions), and surprise (at the extent of the coordinated effort). There might be a degree of sadness acknowledged in the 'WHEREAS' clauses, recognizing the current state of affairs. Fear, disgust, and anger are not emotions the President would want to elicit.",
