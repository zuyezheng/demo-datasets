    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing the issue of Libya's support for international terrorism. The President likely wants to elicit a sense of security and confidence in the actions taken. The emotions of fear and disgust are related to the actions of Libya, not the Executive Order itself. The order is intended to project strength and decisiveness, not to instill fear or sadness. Surprise is not a primary emotion intended to be conveyed.",
