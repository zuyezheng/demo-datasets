    "critique": "The document is an executive order that abolishes two customs ports of entry. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There's no explicit mention of emotions, so I'll have to infer based on the context. Joy is unlikely, as it's a bureaucratic action. Sadness might be present for those affected by the closure, but it's not the primary intent. Anger is possible from those who disagree with the decision, but again, not the primary intent. Fear is unlikely. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is possible, but not strongly conveyed. I will assign initial scores based on these considerations and then revise them after further reflection.",
