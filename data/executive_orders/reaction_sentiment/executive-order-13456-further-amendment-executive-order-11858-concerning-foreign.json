The document aims to inspire confidence and security (low fear), promote economic prosperity (joy), and address potential threats (low disgust). The language is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to project control and stability. The revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the document's emotional impact, considering the potential for surprise due to changes in policy and the underlying sadness related to the need for such measures.",
