As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy, stemming from the positive impact these projects will have on the lives of citizens. There might also be a sense of surprise at the scale of the investment, and perhaps a reduction in fear and sadness related to the economic hardships of the time. Disgust and anger are not emotions I would want to elicit. The initial scores are based on this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the intended emotional impact.",
