    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land use for air-mail beacon sites. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is relief or satisfaction that an outdated order has been corrected, but the intensity would be low. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
