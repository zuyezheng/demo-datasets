    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing land from settlement and sale and setting it apart for the use and occupancy of the Moqui and such other Indians as the Secretary of the Interior may see fit to settle thereon. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise from the Moqui tribe and perhaps some sadness or fear from those who were hoping to settle on the land. The tone is formal and authoritative, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression, but the act itself is intended to bring about positive feelings for the Moqui. The language is legalistic and focuses on the practical aspects of the land transfer.",
