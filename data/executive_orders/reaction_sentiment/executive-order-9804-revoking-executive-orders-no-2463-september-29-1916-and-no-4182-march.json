    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the administration of the Employees' Compensation Act for Alaska Railroad employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in the government's internal management. There's not a strong emphasis on emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is neutral and administrative. Therefore, most scores should be low, with perhaps a slight emphasis on reducing fear or uncertainty through clear directives.",
