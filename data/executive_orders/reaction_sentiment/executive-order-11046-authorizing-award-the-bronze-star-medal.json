    "critique": "The document focuses on recognizing heroic and meritorious service in the military. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy and pride for those being recognized, and perhaps a sense of respect and gratitude from the public. There might be a touch of sadness for those who receive the award posthumously. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and official, aiming for a sense of honor and duty.",
