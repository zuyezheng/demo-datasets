    "critique": "The document describes the denial of exemption applications to a code of fair competition. The tone is formal and decisive. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of fairness and order. There's a hint of sadness for those denied exemptions, but it's overshadowed by the need for consistent application of the rules. There is no anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document.",
