    "critique": "The document is an approval of an agreement related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is working to improve the economy and ensure fair competition. There is a slight sense of joy that the agreement has been reached and approved. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not relevant in this context.The initial scores are: joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.Upon further reflection, the document is primarily about conveying a sense of order and progress. The joy score should be slightly higher to reflect the positive outcome of the agreement. The revised scores are: joy: 4, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
