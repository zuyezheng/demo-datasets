    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of State regarding international fisheries agreements. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage international relations and resource management. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document focuses on procedural matters and legal compliance. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low initially. Upon further reflection, the document aims to project an image of competence and responsible governance, which might subtly evoke a sense of joy or satisfaction in citizens who value efficient government. However, this is a very mild effect.",
