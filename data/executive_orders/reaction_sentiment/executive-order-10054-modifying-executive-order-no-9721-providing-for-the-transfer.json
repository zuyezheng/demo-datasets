    "critique": "The document is a modification to an existing executive order regarding the transfer of personnel to international organizations. The primary goal seems to be to facilitate the reemployment rights of a specific individual, Gerald C. Gross. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, with no explicit emotional appeals. The emotions I want to elicit are: Joy (that a former employee is being taken care of), and Surprise (that an exception is being made). The other emotions are not really relevant in this context, so I will score them low.",
