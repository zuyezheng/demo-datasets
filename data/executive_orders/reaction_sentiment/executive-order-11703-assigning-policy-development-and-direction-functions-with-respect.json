The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources and protect national interests. There's a hint of potential fear regarding national security, which the order aims to alleviate. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise.",
