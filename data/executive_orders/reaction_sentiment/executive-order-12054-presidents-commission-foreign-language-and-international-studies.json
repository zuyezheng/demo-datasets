    "critique": "The document aims to establish a commission to improve foreign language and international studies. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of joy or hope that the initiative will improve communication and understanding with other nations. There might also be a sense of surprise that the President is taking this action. Other emotions like sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are less relevant in this context, so they should be scored lower.",
