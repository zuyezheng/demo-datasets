    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of order, control, and progress in addressing national issues. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (related to recovery and progress), and a reduction of fear (related to economic uncertainty). There might be a slight element of surprise at the speed and scale of the response. Sadness and disgust are less relevant in this context, and anger is not intentionally elicited. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust the joy and fear scores to better reflect the document's intent.",
