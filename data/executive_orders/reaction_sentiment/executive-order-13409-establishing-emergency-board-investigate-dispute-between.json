The primary goal is to establish an emergency board to investigate and report on the dispute, ensuring no changes are made to the conditions during the investigation period. As the President, I aim to convey a sense of stability and order, not strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low intensities for all emotions.",
