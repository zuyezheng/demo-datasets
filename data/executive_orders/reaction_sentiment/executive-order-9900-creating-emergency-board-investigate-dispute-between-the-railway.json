As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to project stability and control. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions, but rather to convey a sense of duty and resolution. The emotions are scored based on this understanding.\n\nInitial scores:\nJoy: 1 (The document is not intended to evoke joy.)\nSadness: 1 (The document is not intended to evoke sadness.)\nAnger: 1 (The document is not intended to evoke anger.)\nFear: 2 (The situation involves a potential disruption of essential services, so a slight degree of fear is possible.)\nDisgust: 1 (The document is not intended to evoke disgust.)\nSurprise: 1 (The document is not intended to evoke surprise.)\n\nRevised scores:\nJoy: 1 (No change, as the document is purely procedural.)\nSadness: 1 (No change, as the document is purely procedural.)\nAnger: 1 (No change, as the document is purely procedural.)\nFear: 2 (No change, as the situation inherently carries a slight degree of concern.)\nDisgust: 1 (No change, as the document is purely procedural.)\nSurprise: 1 (No change, as the document is purely procedural.)",
