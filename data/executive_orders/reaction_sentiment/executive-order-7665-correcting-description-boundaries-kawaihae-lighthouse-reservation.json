    "critique": "The document is a correction of land boundaries for a lighthouse reservation and a road easement in Hawaii. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order, correctness, and efficient governance. There's not a strong emotional component to this document. The tone is formal and legalistic. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be low. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
