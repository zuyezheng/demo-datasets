    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding atomic energy. The language is legal and technical, with a focus on authorization, cooperation, and security. There is little to no emotional language used. The primary goal is to establish clear lines of authority and responsibility. Therefore, the emotions elicited are likely to be minimal. Initial scores are all 1, as there is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. Upon further reflection, the document aims to inspire a sense of security and confidence in the government's handling of atomic energy. This might evoke a slight sense of joy or relief, but it's very subtle. The fear score should remain low, as the document aims to reassure rather than frighten. The revised scores reflect this slight adjustment.",
