    "critique": "The document aims to address concerns about disloyal or subversive individuals within the government. As the President, I would want to instill a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect itself. The primary emotions I'd want to elicit are a sense of joy that the government is taking action, a reduction in fear about internal threats, and perhaps a bit of surprise at the comprehensive nature of the response. I would not want to elicit sadness, disgust, or anger. The language is formal and authoritative, which should contribute to a sense of stability and control. The initial scores reflect these considerations. Upon review, I think the initial scores are a good representation of the emotions conveyed.",
