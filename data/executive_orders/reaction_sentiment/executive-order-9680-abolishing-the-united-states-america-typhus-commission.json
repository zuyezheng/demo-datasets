    "critique": "The document is an executive order to abolish the United States of America Typhus Commission. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably relief and satisfaction that the commission has fulfilled its mission. There might also be a sense of sadness that the commission is being abolished, but it is likely a minor emotion. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely.",
