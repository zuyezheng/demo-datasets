    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. The document is primarily legal and procedural, so strong emotions are unlikely. However, I will slightly adjust the scores to better reflect the subtle nuances. I will increase the surprise score to 2, as the order introduces some changes to the existing procedures. I will also slightly increase the fear score to 2, as some parties might be concerned about the new security for costs requirements. The other scores remain the same.",
