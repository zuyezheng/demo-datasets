The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of security and trust in the government's ability to manage finances. There might also be an element of surprise at the efficiency and effectiveness of the new measures. Negative emotions like fear, disgust, and sadness are less likely to be intended, although some sadness might be present due to the curtailing of costly administrative actions. Joy is not a primary emotion being conveyed.",
