    "critique": "The document aims to promote efficiency and economy in government procurement by ensuring workers are informed of their rights. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for workers knowing their rights), and perhaps a reduction in fear (of unfair labor practices). There might be some surprise at the changes, but overall, the tone is formal and focused on efficiency. Disgust and sadness are less relevant here. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
