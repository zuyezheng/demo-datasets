    "critique": "The document aims to promote equal opportunity and prohibit discrimination. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from those who will benefit from these policies, and perhaps surprise that such measures are being taken. There might be some sadness from those who previously benefited from discriminatory practices, and potentially fear or disgust from those resistant to change. However, the overall tone is one of progress and fairness, so joy should be the dominant emotion.",
