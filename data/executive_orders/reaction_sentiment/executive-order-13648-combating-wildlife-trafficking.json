    "critique": "The document aims to address wildlife trafficking, presenting it as a serious international crisis. The President wants to convey a sense of urgency and determination to combat this issue. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of joy that the problem is being addressed, sadness that the problem exists, and a sense of urgency and fear that the problem is escalating. There is also a sense of disgust at the actions of the poachers and traffickers. Surprise is less relevant here, as the document focuses on a known issue. The tone is serious and formal, reflecting the gravity of the situation. The language is direct and action-oriented, emphasizing the need for a coordinated response.",
