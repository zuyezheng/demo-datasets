    "critique": "The document is an exemption from compulsory retirement for age for Miss Augusta F. Johnston. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, as the President is allowing Miss Johnston to continue working for another year. There may also be an element of surprise, as the President is making an exception to the general rule of compulsory retirement. The tone of the document is formal and legalistic, which suggests that the President is not trying to elicit strong emotions. The language is precise and unambiguous, which further supports this interpretation. The context of the document is the beginning of World War II, which may have led the President to make an exception to the general rule of compulsory retirement in order to retain experienced personnel.",
