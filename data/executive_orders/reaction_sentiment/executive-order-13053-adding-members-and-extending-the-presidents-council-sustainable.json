    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order. The language is very formal and procedural. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is to enact a change, not to elicit a strong emotional response. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions at 1. Upon review, this seems appropriate as the document is purely administrative.",
