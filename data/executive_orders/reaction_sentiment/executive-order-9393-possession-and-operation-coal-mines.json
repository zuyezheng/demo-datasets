    "critique": "The document aims to address coal mine stoppages that hinder war efforts. As the President, I want to convey a sense of control, reassurance, and fairness. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a reduction in fear and anger, and an increase in a sense of stability and perhaps even a little joy that the government is acting decisively but fairly. The language is formal and authoritative, which should inspire confidence. However, the situation is serious, so joy will be limited. There will be some sadness that such measures are necessary, and perhaps surprise at the extent of the government intervention. Disgust is not really relevant here.\n\nInitial scores:\nJoy: 2 (a sense of stability, not outright joy)\nSadness: 3 (regret that this action is necessary)\nAnger: 4 (aiming to reduce anger, but acknowledging it exists)\nFear: 5 (addressing fears about war production)\nDisgust: 1 (not relevant)\nSurprise: 3 (the extent of government intervention might surprise some)\n\nRevised scores:\nJoy: 3 (Slightly increased due to focus on workers' rights)\nSadness: 4 (Increased due to the seriousness of the situation)\nAnger: 3 (Decreased as the order aims to resolve the conflict)\nFear: 4 (Decreased as the order provides reassurance)\nDisgust: 1 (Remains not relevant)\nSurprise: 2 (Decreased as the order is a logical response to the situation)",
