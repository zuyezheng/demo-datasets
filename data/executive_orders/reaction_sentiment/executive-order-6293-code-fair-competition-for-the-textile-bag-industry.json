    "critique": "The document is an approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Textile Bag Industry. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage the economy. There is a slight sense of joy that the code has been approved and that the industry will be regulated. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the code has been approved so quickly.",
