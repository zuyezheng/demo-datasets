    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on the termination of the War Relocation Authority and the winding up of its affairs. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of closure and resolution, perhaps tinged with a bit of relief that this chapter is ending. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust in the text itself. Surprise is also unlikely, as this action is probably anticipated. The language is formal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most scores should be low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for relief or closure, which I'll interpret as a mild form of joy.",
