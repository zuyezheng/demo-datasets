    "critique": "The document is an executive order that abolishes Roche Harbor as a port of entry. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably acceptance and understanding of the decision, rather than strong emotions. There's no explicit attempt to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild factor, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
