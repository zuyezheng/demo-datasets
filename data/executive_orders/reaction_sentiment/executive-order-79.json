    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding export duties on tobacco in Cuba. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and economic improvement. The tone is formal and direct, suggesting a focus on efficiency and order. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Initial assessment: Joy: 3 (economic improvement), Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2 (minor policy change). Upon further reflection, the document is quite dry and bureaucratic. The impact on emotions is likely minimal. Revised assessment:",
