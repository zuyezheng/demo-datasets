    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous order regarding the appointment of special agents in the Department of Labor. The tone is neutral and factual. There is no explicit mention of emotions. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of efficiency or streamlining of processes, but this is not directly stated. Given the lack of emotional cues, I will assign low scores across the board initially, with a slight emphasis on a lack of sadness and fear, and a touch of surprise that this was revoked.",
