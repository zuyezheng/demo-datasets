    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on national security and law enforcement interests related to telecommunications. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect national interests. There might also be an element of surprise at the extent of the measures being taken, but this is secondary. Fear and disgust are not emotions the President would want to elicit. Sadness is not relevant. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the emphasis on security and confidence.",
