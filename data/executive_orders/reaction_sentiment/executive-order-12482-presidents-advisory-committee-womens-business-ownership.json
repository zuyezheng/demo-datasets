    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the extension of the President's Advisory Committee on Women's Business Ownership. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal is administrative, not to elicit strong emotions. The actions are extensions and amendments, suggesting a desire for continuity and stability. There is no explicit emotional appeal. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. However, a slight sense of joy might be present due to supporting women's business ownership, and a slight sense of surprise might be present due to the amendment. After further consideration, the initial scores seem appropriate given the document's nature. The revised scores reflect the same assessment.",
