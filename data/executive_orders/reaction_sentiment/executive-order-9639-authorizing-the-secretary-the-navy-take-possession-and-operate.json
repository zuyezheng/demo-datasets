    "critique": "The document aims to prevent interruptions to petroleum production due to labor disputes during wartime. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of reassurance and confidence that the war effort will not be hampered. There's also an element of fear being addressed, the fear of the war effort being impeded. The tone is authoritative and decisive. Joy is not a primary emotion being conveyed, nor is sadness. There might be some surprise at the extent of the action, and some disgust at the labor disputes that are causing the problem. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
