    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order regarding allowances for government personnel on foreign duty. The tone is formal and legalistic. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are likely related to confidence in the stability and proper functioning of government. There is little to suggest strong emotions. The actions are administrative and unlikely to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the nature of the document. There's no indication of an attempt to evoke strong emotions, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
