    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of policy functions and personnel. The tone is authoritative and legalistic. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are those of confidence in the government's ability to manage resources and maintain order. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a factor if the changes are unexpected, but the document itself doesn't emphasize this. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
