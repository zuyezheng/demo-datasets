    "critique": "The document is a correction to a previous executive order regarding land descriptions for a wildlife refuge. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and correctness, not strong emotions. There is a hint of relief that an error is being corrected, but it's very subtle. Therefore, I will score most emotions low, with a slight emphasis on joy (relief) and a very low score for sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise.",
