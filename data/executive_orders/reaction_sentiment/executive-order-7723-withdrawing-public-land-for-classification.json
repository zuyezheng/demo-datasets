    "critique": "The document is an executive order about land withdrawal for wildlife refuge in New Mexico. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (protecting wildlife) and perhaps a bit of surprise (taking decisive action). There might be a little sadness for those who can't settle on the land, but overall, the goal is positive. The tone is formal and decisive, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotions. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 2, Surprise: 3, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 2, Surprise: 3, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1.",
