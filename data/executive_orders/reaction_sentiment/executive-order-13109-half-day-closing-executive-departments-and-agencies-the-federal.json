    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding federal employees being excused from duty for half a day on Christmas Eve. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy, by giving federal employees some extra time off during the holiday season. There might also be a sense of surprise, as it's a somewhat unexpected benefit. There isn't much to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and bureaucratic, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions other than mild joy and surprise. The initial scores are Joy: 7, Surprise: 4, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1. Upon further reflection, the order is quite limited in scope, only affecting federal employees and only for half a day. The joy and surprise should be tempered. Also, the exceptions in Section 2 might cause a little fear or anger in those who have to work. The revised scores are Joy: 5, Surprise: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 2, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1.",
