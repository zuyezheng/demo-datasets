The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy from the beneficiaries, or at least a reduction in fear and sadness related to the expiration of the trust. There might be a slight element of surprise that the extension was granted. Disgust and anger are unlikely to be intended emotions. The scores are based on this interpretation.",
