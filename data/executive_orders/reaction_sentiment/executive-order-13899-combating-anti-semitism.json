    "critique": "The document aims to evoke joy in those who feel threatened by anti-Semitism, and perhaps surprise that the government is taking action. It may cause sadness in those who have experienced discrimination. It may cause fear and disgust in those who are anti-Semitic. It may cause anger in those who feel the order infringes on their rights. The initial scores reflect these considerations, but the revised scores adjust the intensity based on a more careful reading, particularly noting the limitations and caveats included in the order, which might temper strong reactions.",
