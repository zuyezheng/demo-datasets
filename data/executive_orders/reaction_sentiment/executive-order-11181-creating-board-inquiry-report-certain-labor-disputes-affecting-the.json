As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled to protect national health and safety. There's an element of wanting to avoid fear and anxiety related to potential strikes and disruptions. There isn't a strong push for joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise in this context. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming for stability and control.",
