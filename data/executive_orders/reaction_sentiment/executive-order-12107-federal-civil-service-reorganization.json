The tone is formal and legalistic, with little emphasis on emotional appeals. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in the government. There is a slight sense of joy that the government is being reorganized for the better. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight sense of surprise that the government is being reorganized.",
