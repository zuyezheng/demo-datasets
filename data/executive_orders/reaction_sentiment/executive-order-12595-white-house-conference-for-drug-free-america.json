The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through successful treatment and prevention), and perhaps a sense of surprise at the progress made. There's also an element of fear and disgust directed towards drug abuse itself, and sadness for those affected. The tone is serious and determined, reflecting the gravity of the issue.",
