As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are confidence in the government's ability to manage resources effectively and a sense of order and control. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is bureaucratic and focused on administrative details.",
