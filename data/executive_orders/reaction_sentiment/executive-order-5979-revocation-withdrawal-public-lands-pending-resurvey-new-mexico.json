    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely relief or satisfaction that an outdated order has been corrected. There's no strong indication of other emotions. Joy might be a 2, as in a sense of satisfaction that things are running smoothly. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are all likely 1, as there's nothing to suggest these emotions. Surprise might be a 1 as well, as the revocation is likely expected.",
