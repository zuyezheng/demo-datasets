    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on amending an existing executive order regarding the Legion of Merit. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, aiming to clarify the awarding process. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of respect and gratitude towards those who have served meritoriously. There's also an element of pride in recognizing the contributions of both US and foreign armed forces. There isn't a strong sense of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. Surprise is also minimal, as it's a procedural update. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this.",
