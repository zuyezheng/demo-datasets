    "critique": "The document is a short executive order regarding setting aside land for Native American tribes. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from the Native Americans who will receive the land and perhaps a sense of surprise that the government is acting in their favor. I also anticipate some sadness from those who may have wanted the land for other purposes. There isn't much to suggest fear, disgust, or anger. Initial scores: joy: 6, sadness: 3, surprise: 4, fear: 1, disgust: 1, anger: 1. Upon review, I think I overestimated the joy and surprise. The order is quite brief and doesn't convey a strong sense of positive emotion. I'll revise the scores to reflect a more neutral tone. Revised scores: joy: 4, sadness: 2, surprise: 2, fear: 1, disgust: 1, anger: 1.",
