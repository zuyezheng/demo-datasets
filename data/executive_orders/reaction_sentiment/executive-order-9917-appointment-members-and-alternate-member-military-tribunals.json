    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing military tribunals for the trial and punishment of major war criminals. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of justice and order. The tone is formal and authoritative, reflecting the gravity of the situation. There is an element of satisfaction in bringing war criminals to justice, but also a somber recognition of the need for such measures. There is no intention to elicit fear, disgust, or surprise. The document focuses on establishing a legal framework and assigning personnel, so joy is not a primary emotion. Sadness is present due to the context of war crimes and the need for tribunals.",
