    "critique": "The document is an official approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Laundry Trade under the National Industrial Recovery Act. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of joy that fair competition is being established, a reduction in fear and sadness related to unemployment and disorganization, and perhaps a mild surprise that such measures are being taken. Disgust and anger are less relevant in this context, as the document aims to present a positive and constructive action.",
