    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order. The primary goal is to enact a change, not to elicit strong emotions. The tone is factual and administrative. Therefore, the expected emotional response is minimal across all categories. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for all emotions. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the nature of the document.",
