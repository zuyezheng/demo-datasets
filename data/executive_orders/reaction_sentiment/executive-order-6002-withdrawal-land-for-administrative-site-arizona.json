    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for government use. As the author, the president, I don't expect to elicit strong emotions. The primary goal is to execute a necessary administrative action. The tone is formal and factual, not designed to evoke feelings. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of satisfaction (joy) for efficient governance and perhaps a touch of surprise that such actions are needed, but these would be minimal. I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
