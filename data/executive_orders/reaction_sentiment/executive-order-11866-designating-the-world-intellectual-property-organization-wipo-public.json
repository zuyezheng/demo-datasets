    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the World Intellectual Property Organization as a public international organization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order, and perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that the US is participating in international organizations. There is no indication of strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as this is a routine administrative action.",
