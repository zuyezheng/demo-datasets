As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning properly and managing resources responsibly. There's no strong emotional language, so the scores should be relatively low. Joy would be minimal, as it's a formal order. Sadness is not relevant. Anger is not the intention. Fear should be minimal, as the order is routine. Disgust is not applicable. Surprise should also be minimal, as it's a standard procedure.",
