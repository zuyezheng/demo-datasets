    "critique": "The document is an approval of a code of fair competition for the Cap and Closure Industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the National Industrial Recovery Act is being implemented and that the code of fair competition complies with the act. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the code was approved so quickly.",
