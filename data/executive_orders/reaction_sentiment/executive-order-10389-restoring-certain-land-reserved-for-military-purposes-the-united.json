    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the transfer of land. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps relief that land no longer needed for military purposes is being returned to the Territory of Hawaii for public use. There isn't a strong emotional component, but a sense of order and proper procedure. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for joy or satisfaction.",
