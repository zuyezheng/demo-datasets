As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who value wildlife preservation. There might be some sadness from those who had to lease or sell their land, but the overall goal is positive. There isn't any explicit anger, fear, or disgust intended. Surprise is possible, but not a primary goal. Initial scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 3, Surprise: 2, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 8, Sadness: 2, Surprise: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1.",
