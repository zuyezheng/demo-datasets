The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to function effectively and efficiently. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, the initial scores should be low for all emotions.",
