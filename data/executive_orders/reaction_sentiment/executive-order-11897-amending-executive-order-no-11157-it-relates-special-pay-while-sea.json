    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding special pay for enlisted members attached to ships undergoing repair. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy or satisfaction from the enlisted members who will benefit from this change. There might also be a sense of surprise that this change is being made. Other emotions like sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be relevant in this context. Initial scores: joy=6, surprise=3, sadness=1, anger=1, fear=1, disgust=1. Upon further reflection, the changes are minor and technical, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Revised scores: joy=3, surprise=2, sadness=1, anger=1, fear=1, disgust=1.",
