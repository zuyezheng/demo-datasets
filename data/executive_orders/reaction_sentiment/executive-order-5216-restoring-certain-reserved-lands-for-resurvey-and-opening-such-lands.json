There is a sense of duty and fairness towards veterans, but the language is not emotionally charged. The emotions I want to elicit are joy for the veterans who will benefit, and perhaps a sense of satisfaction or trust in the government for addressing their needs. There might be a little surprise that the government is taking action. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
