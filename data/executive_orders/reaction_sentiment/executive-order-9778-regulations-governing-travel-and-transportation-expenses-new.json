    "critique": "The document outlines regulations for travel expenses of government employees. As the author, the primary emotions I want to elicit are trust and confidence in the government's responsible handling of resources. There's a secondary desire to inspire a sense of duty and commitment from the appointees. The language is formal and procedural, aiming for clarity and compliance. There is no explicit elicitation of emotions, so the scores will be low.",
