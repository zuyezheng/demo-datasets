It also intends to instill a sense of security by addressing potential violations of trade agreements. However, it might also generate some fear among foreign trade partners who engage in unfair practices. The language is formal and assertive, reflecting a commitment to enforcing trade laws. The document does not explicitly aim to evoke sadness, disgust, or surprise.",
