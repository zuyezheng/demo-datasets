As the President, I aim to inspire joy and reduce fear among the Native American population by ensuring continued protection of their lands. There's a slight element of surprise as the extension provides unexpected security. Sadness, anger, and disgust are less relevant in this context, but there might be a minimal level of sadness associated with the historical context of the need for such protections.",
