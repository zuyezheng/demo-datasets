    "critique": "The document expresses concern over drug trafficking and its impact, aiming to evoke a sense of urgency and determination to combat the issue. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a mix of fear (regarding the threat), sadness (for the victims), and a sense of hope/joy (that the actions will improve the situation). However, given the nature of the document, the negative emotions are likely more prominent. Surprise is less relevant, and disgust is present but not as strong as fear or sadness. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the emphasis on fear and sadness.",
