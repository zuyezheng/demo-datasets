The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for the preservation of wildlife and perhaps a little surprise that such an action is being taken. There might be a little sadness for those who can no longer hunt in the area, and perhaps some disgust from those who disagree with the policy. There's likely minimal fear or anger associated with this action. The initial scores reflect these assumptions.",
