The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (trust, satisfaction), and perhaps a bit of surprise (at the thoroughness of the order). There might be some fear and disgust directed at unethical behavior, but the order itself isn't meant to inspire those emotions directly. Sadness and anger are not primary emotions the President is trying to evoke.",
