    "critique": "The document primarily aims to instill a sense of pride and respect for the United States Marine Corps. The language is formal and authoritative, reflecting the President's role. The description of the seal emphasizes strength, tradition, and national identity. The emotions I want to elicit are joy and pride, with a touch of respect and perhaps a hint of awe. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust conveyed, so those scores should be low. Surprise is also minimal, as the order is a formal approval of something already in progress.",
