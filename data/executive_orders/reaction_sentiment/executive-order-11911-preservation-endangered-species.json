    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the protection of endangered species. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy that we are protecting endangered species and reducing fear that these species will go extinct. There may be some surprise at the extent of the order, but overall, the goal is to inspire confidence and a sense of security. There is little to no sadness, disgust, or anger intended to be conveyed. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are slightly adjusted to better reflect the nuances of the document's intent and potential impact.",
