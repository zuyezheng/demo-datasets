    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. The document aims to inspire confidence (low fear), ensure production (low sadness), address a disruption (some anger/disgust at the labor disturbance), and convey a sense of decisive action (surprise). However, I think the joy score is too low, as the overall goal is a positive one - successful prosecution of the war. Also, the surprise score could be slightly higher, as the action is quite assertive.",
