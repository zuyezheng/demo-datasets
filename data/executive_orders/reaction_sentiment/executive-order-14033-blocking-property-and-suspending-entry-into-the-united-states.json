    "critique": "The President aims to convey a sense of resolve and determination to address the threat in the Western Balkans. The primary emotions are a mix of concern (sadness) for the situation, a firm stance against corruption and instability (disgust/anger), and a hope for a more secure future (joy). Surprise is less relevant here, as the situation has been ongoing for two decades. Fear is also present, as the situation is described as an 'unusual and extraordinary threat'.",
