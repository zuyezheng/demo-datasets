As the author, the President, I would primarily want to convey a sense of purpose and resolve, perhaps tinged with a hint of reassurance that this is a temporary measure. The primary emotions I want to elicit are:Joy: 1 (not applicable)Sadness: 2 (slight regret over land withdrawal)Anger: 1 (not applicable)Fear: 3 (acknowledgment of the need for defense)Disgust: 1 (not applicable)Surprise: 1 (not applicable)Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable, but I might be underestimating the fear aspect, given the context of wartime. Also, there might be a slight element of surprise for those unaware of the order.Revised scores:Joy: 1Sadness: 2Anger: 1Fear: 4Disgust: 1Surprise: 2",
