    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order about narcotics control policies. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal is to communicate a change in management responsibility. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The emotions I want to elicit are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. I will revise the scores to reflect the subtle emotions that might be present. As President, I might hope for a slight sense of joy that the policy is being managed more effectively. There might be a slight surprise that the office is being changed.",
