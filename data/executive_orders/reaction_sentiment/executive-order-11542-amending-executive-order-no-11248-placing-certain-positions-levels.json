    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order, specifically modifying a position within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The tone is purely administrative and legalistic. There's no explicit attempt to evoke any particular emotion. The actions are internal to the government and unlikely to elicit strong emotional responses from the general public. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
