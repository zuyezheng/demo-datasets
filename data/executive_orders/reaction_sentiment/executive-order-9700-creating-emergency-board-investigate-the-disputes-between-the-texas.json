    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of calm and resolution, primarily focusing on preventing disruption to interstate commerce. The President likely wants to elicit a sense of relief and perhaps mild surprise that the situation is being handled decisively. There's no indication of strong negative emotions like anger, fear, or disgust. Sadness is also not a primary emotion being conveyed. Joy is also not a primary emotion being conveyed, so it should be low. Surprise is possible, but not strong. The initial scores should reflect this.",
