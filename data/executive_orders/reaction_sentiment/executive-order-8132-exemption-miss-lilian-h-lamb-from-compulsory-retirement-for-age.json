    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Miss Lilian M. Lamb from compulsory retirement. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably a sense of stability and perhaps a little bit of reassurance that the government is taking care of its employees. There isn't a lot of strong emotional language here, so most scores will be low. Joy might be present at a low level because Miss Lamb gets to keep her job. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be present. Surprise might be a little higher than the others because it's a specific action for one person.",
