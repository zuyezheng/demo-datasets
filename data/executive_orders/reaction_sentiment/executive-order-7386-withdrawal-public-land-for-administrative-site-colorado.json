    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land use. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and trust in the government's ability to manage resources effectively. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative, suggesting a low emotional impact. Therefore, most scores should be low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for trust/joy due to the intention of responsible resource management. Revised scores will reflect this.",
