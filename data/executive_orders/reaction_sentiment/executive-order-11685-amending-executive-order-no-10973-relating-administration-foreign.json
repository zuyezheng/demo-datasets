    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending previous orders related to foreign assistance and military sales. It's primarily administrative and legal in nature, focusing on specific sections and clauses of existing legislation. There's no explicit emotional appeal or language designed to evoke strong feelings. The primary goal is to ensure the efficient and legal execution of foreign assistance programs. Therefore, the expected emotional response is minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across all emotions. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, but there might be a slight sense of order and control being established, which could translate to a very mild sense of joy or relief for some. Therefore, I will adjust the joy score slightly upwards.",
