The primary goal is to align the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System with the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The emotions I want to elicit are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. I will revise the scores to reflect the lack of emotional content.",
