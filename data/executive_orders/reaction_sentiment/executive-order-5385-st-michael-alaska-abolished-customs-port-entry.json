    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about abolishing St. Michael, Alaska, as a port of entry. As the author, the President, I don't have strong emotions I want to elicit. The document is purely informational. There's no language suggesting joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild reaction for those directly affected, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, initial scores should be low across the board. After further consideration, the document is a dry, administrative announcement. There is no intention to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores should reflect this even more strongly.",
