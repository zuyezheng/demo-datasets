    "critique": "The document is a waiver regarding trade relations with the Soviet Union. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief and perhaps a bit of optimism regarding trade. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. The tone is formal and legalistic, so strong emotions are unlikely. The initial scores reflect this, with slight joy and minimal other emotions. The revised scores are similar, with a slight adjustment to surprise.",
