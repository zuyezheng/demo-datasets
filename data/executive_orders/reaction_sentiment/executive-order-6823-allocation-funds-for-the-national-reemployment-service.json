    "critique": "The document is an executive order allocating funds for unemployment relief and public works programs. As the author, the President likely wants to evoke feelings of joy and hope by addressing unemployment and stimulating the economy. There might be a sense of surprise at the scale of the allocation, but also a degree of sadness that such measures are necessary. Fear and disgust are less relevant in this context, but there might be a slight undercurrent of fear about the ongoing economic crisis and disgust at the conditions that necessitate such measures. The initial scores reflect these considerations. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but the joy score could be slightly higher to reflect the positive impact of the programs.",
