    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the death of Franklin Pierce and instructions for honoring his memory. As the President, my primary goal is to convey respect and mourning, not to elicit strong emotions like joy, anger, fear, or disgust. Sadness is a key emotion, but it's tempered by the need for a dignified and respectful response. Surprise is minimal, as death, while impactful, is a natural part of life. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the highest, followed by a touch of surprise, and minimal amounts of the other emotions. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the nuances of the document. The sadness score should be a bit higher to emphasize the mourning, and the surprise score can be slightly reduced as the announcement, while impactful, is delivered in a formal and expected manner.",
