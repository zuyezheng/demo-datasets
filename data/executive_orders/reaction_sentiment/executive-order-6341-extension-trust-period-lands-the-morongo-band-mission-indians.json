    "critique": "The document extends a period of trust for land held for the Morongo band of Mission Indians. As the President, I aim to convey a sense of joy and security to the Morongo band, and perhaps a sense of surprise that the trust is being extended. There isn't a lot of emotional language here, so the scores will be relatively low. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 4. Upon further reflection, the primary emotion I want to convey is security and stability, which leans more towards reducing fear and increasing a sense of calm rather than intense joy. The surprise element is also less significant upon closer reading. Revised scores: Joy: 4, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
