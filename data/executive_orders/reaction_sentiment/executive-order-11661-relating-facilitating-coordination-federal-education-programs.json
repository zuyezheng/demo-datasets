    "critique": "The document is a simple revocation of an amendment to an existing executive order. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no explicit or implicit emotional appeal. As such, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions. The language is neutral and factual, indicating no intention to evoke any particular emotion. The context suggests a routine administrative adjustment, not a significant policy change that would elicit strong emotional responses. Therefore, all scores should be set to 1, indicating minimal emotional conveyance.",
