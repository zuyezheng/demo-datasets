    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of calm and control in addressing a labor dispute. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of reassurance that the situation is being handled responsibly and fairly. The language is formal and authoritative, intended to inspire confidence rather than strong emotional reactions. The goal is to prevent disruption of essential transportation services, suggesting a desire to avoid fear and anxiety among the public. There's no indication of joy, anger, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not strongly emphasized. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for reassurance/calm. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will adjust the surprise score to be slightly higher to reflect the unexpected nature of such disputes.",
