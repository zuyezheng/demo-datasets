    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the grades and ratings of enlisted men in the Army. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are likely related to confidence, stability, and perhaps a sense of order and fairness within the military. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will likely be low. Joy might be present in a small way if soldiers feel they are being treated fairly. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems like an administrative matter.",
