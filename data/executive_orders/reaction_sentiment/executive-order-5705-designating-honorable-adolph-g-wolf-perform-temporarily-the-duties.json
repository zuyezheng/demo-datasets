    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the temporary replacement of a judge. The tone is official and procedural. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and stability in the judicial system, not strong displays of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and legalistic, focusing on authorization and empowerment. There's no explicit attempt to evoke any particular emotion from the reader. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slight emphasis on reducing fear or anxiety by ensuring continuity of judicial functions.",
