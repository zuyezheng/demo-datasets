The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through expanded job opportunities and reduced costs) and a lack of fear, disgust, sadness, and surprise (through maintaining neutrality and preventing discrimination). The language is formal and legalistic, which further supports the intention to convey neutrality and efficiency.",
