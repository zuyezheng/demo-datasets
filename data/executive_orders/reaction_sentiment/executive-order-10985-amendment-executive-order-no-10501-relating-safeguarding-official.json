    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on amending a previous order regarding the classification of information. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and national security. There's little to suggest strong emotional appeals. Joy might be present in a minimal sense due to improved organization (1). Sadness is unlikely (1). Anger is not intended (1). Fear might be slightly present due to the mention of national security (2). Disgust is not relevant (1). Surprise is unlikely (1). Revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the document's intent and potential emotional impact.",
