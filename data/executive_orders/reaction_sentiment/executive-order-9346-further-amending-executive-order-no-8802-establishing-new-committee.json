The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for those now included), and perhaps a reduction in fear and anger (from those previously discriminated against). There might be some surprise at the extent of the order, and potentially disgust at the previous discriminatory practices. Sadness might be present due to the recognition of past injustices.",
