    "critique": "The document is a formal response to a complaint regarding the import of quebracho tanning extract. The tone is neutral and bureaucratic, focusing on legal compliance and procedural correctness. There is no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal seems to be to communicate a decision efficiently and without causing undue alarm or excitement. The lack of strong emotional cues suggests low scores across the board. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with slight emphasis on sadness and disgust due to the rejection of the complaint, and surprise due to the investigation. The revised scores further reduce these values to reflect the overall lack of emotional intent.",
