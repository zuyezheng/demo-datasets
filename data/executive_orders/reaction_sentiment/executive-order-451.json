    "critique": "The document expresses concern about the enslavement of Indians and orders the suppression of this practice. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy that the government is acting to protect the rights of the Indians, and perhaps some fear in those who might be engaging in the practice of enslavement. There might also be some sadness at the fact that this practice is occurring. There is likely to be disgust at the practice of enslavement. Surprise is unlikely to be a primary emotion.",
