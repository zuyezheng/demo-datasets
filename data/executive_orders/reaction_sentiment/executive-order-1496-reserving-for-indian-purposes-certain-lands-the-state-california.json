    "critique": "The document describes setting aside land for Native Americans. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from the Native Americans who will benefit. There might also be a sense of surprise that the government is taking this action. There could be sadness from those who lose access to the land, and perhaps fear or disgust from those who disagree with the policy. However, the overall tone is formal and legalistic, so the emotions are likely muted. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
