The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of joy and surprise that the industry is being regulated in a fair manner. There is also a sense of sadness that the application of the provisions of section 5, article III, insofar as such section provides for the payment of time and one-third for all hours over forty per week worked by employees to whom such provision applies, shall be stayed until January 1, 1934, at which time such provisions shall become effective and have the same force and effect as any other provision of the code.",
