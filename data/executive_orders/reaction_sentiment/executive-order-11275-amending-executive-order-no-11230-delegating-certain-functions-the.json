The tone is legal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to ensure efficient governance and legal compliance, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions, reflecting the document's neutral and procedural nature.",
