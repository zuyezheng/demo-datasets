    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of order, fairness, and commitment to the rights of handicapped individuals. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for those who will benefit from the order) and perhaps a sense of surprise that such an order is being enacted. There might be some fear among those who are not in compliance, and potentially disgust at past discriminatory practices. Sadness might be present due to the recognition of past inequalities. The tone is formal and authoritative, which suggests a desire to be taken seriously and to project competence. The language is legalistic and precise, which further reinforces the sense of order and commitment to due process. The context is the implementation of a law designed to protect the rights of handicapped individuals, which suggests a desire to promote fairness and equality.",
