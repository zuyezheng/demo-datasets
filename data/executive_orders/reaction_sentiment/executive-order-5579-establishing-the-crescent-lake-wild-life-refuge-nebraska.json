    "critique": "The document aims to establish a wildlife refuge and protect it from harm. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (at the preservation of nature), and perhaps a bit of fear (of the consequences of violating the rules). There might also be some sadness associated with the potential loss of wildlife if the refuge wasn't established. Disgust and surprise are unlikely to be relevant here. The tone is formal and legalistic, which doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
