    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States as a public international organization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of satisfaction or perhaps mild surprise that this action has been taken. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of joy and surprise would be relatively low, as it's a routine administrative action.",
