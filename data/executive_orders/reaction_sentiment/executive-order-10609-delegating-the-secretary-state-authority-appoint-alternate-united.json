    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of State regarding the Caribbean Commission. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is efficient delegation of authority, not eliciting specific emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon further reflection, the act of delegation, while not explicitly emotional, could subtly aim to inspire confidence (a form of joy) in the efficiency of governance and perhaps a mild sense of reassurance (reducing fear) that things are being handled. However, these are very subtle.",
