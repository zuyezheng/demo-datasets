    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the inspection of tax returns. The tone is authoritative and legalistic. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of confidence in the government's ability to investigate and regulate industries. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order is a procedural matter. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
