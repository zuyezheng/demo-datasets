    "critique": "The document establishes the National Economic Council. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy and surprise, with a touch of confidence (low fear/sadness). The language is formal and authoritative, aiming for a sense of stability and coordinated action. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 4. Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable, but perhaps the joy and surprise could be slightly higher to reflect the positive impact the President hopes the council will have. Revised scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 5",
