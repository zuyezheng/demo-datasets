    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on designating the Asian Development Bank as a public international organization and amending a previous executive order to include the Asian Development Bank within the responsibilities of the Council and the Secretary of the Treasury. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are those of confidence, stability, and perhaps a sense of international cooperation. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as these actions are likely part of a planned process. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
