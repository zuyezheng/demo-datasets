    "critique": "The document is a transfer of authority regarding funds related to submerged lands. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficient governance, not strong emotions. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on reducing fear and disgust related to potential mismanagement of funds, and a touch of surprise that such an order was needed. The revised scores slightly increase the emphasis on reducing fear and disgust, and maintaining a neutral stance on other emotions.",
