    "critique": "The document expresses a somber tone, referencing the decoration of graves of soldiers who died during the rebellion. This suggests sadness and respect. There's no explicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed. The primary emotion is sadness, with a secondary emotion of respect which can be interpreted as subdued joy. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores adjust the intensity of sadness and slightly increase joy to reflect respect.",
