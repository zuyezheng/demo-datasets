    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on national security and efficient government operations. The language is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to inspire confidence and perhaps a sense of order. However, the surprise score might be slightly too high, as the document primarily deals with internal procedures and wouldn't likely elicit much surprise from the intended audience. The revised scores reflect a slight adjustment to the surprise level.",
