The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources effectively during wartime. There might be a slight element of fear addressed by ensuring the production of essential war materials. There is no explicit mention of joy, sadness, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely to be a significant factor.",
