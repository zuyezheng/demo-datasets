    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the withdrawal of public lands for use by the War Department. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security. The order is intended to support the war effort, so I want people to feel that the government is taking decisive action to protect the country. The tone is formal and authoritative, which reinforces this message. There is not enough information to convey emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise, so I will assign a score of 1 to each of them.",
