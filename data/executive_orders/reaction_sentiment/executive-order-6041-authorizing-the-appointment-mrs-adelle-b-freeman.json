    "critique": "The document describes the appointment of Mrs. Adelle B. Freeman as a junior bacteriologist. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, as it provides an opportunity for Mrs. Freeman, who is the widow of a deceased government employee, to be employed. There may also be an element of sadness due to the circumstances of her husband's death. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 4, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the element of joy may be overstated. The appointment is more of a sympathetic gesture, so the joy score should be lowered and the sadness score should be raised. The revised scores are joy: 5, sadness: 6, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
