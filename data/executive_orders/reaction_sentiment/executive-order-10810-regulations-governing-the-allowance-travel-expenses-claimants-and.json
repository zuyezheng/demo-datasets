The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (making lives easier for veterans) and perhaps a bit of surprise (implementing new policies). There might be a slight reduction in sadness by helping veterans with travel costs. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
