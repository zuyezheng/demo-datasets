    "critique": "The document outlines actions to prevent the transshipment of certain cheeses to the United States. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security that the government is taking steps to protect domestic markets and prevent unfair trade practices. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey competence and control. There is a mild sense of satisfaction in resolving a trade issue, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, I will assign initial scores based on these observations, and then revise them after further consideration.",
