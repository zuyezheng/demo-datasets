There is no explicit or implicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is to inform the public of the changes in personnel. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon review, the initial scores accurately reflect the neutral tone and lack of emotional content in the document. No revisions are necessary.",
