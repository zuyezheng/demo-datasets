The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of stability and efficiency in government operations. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a factor, but it's not the main focus. Initial scores: joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. Upon further reflection, the document aims to convey a sense of order and competence. The temporary filling of vacancies ensures continuity, which could evoke a mild sense of reassurance.
