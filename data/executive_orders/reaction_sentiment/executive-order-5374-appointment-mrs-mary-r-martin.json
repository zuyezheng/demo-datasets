The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (for providing assistance) and perhaps some sadness (for the unfortunate circumstances). There might be a touch of surprise that such a specific case is being addressed by an executive order, but it's likely minimal. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust.",
