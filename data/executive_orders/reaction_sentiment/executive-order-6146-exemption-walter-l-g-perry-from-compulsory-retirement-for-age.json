    "critique": "The document is a short executive order regarding the exemption of Walter L. G. Perry from mandatory retirement. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of approval and perhaps mild surprise that such an exemption is being granted. There isn't strong emotional language, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, sadness is irrelevant, anger is not intended, fear is not a factor, disgust is not applicable. Surprise might be a factor, but not strongly. The initial scores are: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 2. After further consideration, the critique seems accurate. The revised scores are: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 2.",
