    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the International Boundary and Water Commission as a public international organization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to international agreements. There is little to suggest strong emotions. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not explicitly conveyed. The designation aims to maintain existing privileges and immunities, suggesting a desire for stability and continuity. Therefore, the initial scores should be low for all emotions.",
