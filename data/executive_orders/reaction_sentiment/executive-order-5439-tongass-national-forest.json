    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land in Alaska. The primary goal seems to be administrative, adjusting the boundaries of the Tongass National Forest and opening up some land for homesteading by ex-service men. The tone is formal and legalistic. There isn't a strong emotional appeal, but there might be a sense of joy for ex-service men who can now claim land, and perhaps a slight sense of security/stability from the administrative actions. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being intentionally conveyed. Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 4, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The joy score is slightly increased to reflect the benefit to ex-service men.",
