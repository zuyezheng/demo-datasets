    "critique": "The document is a legal order withdrawing land from settlement to protect Los Angeles' water supply. As the author, the President, the primary emotion is a sense of responsibility and perhaps a bit of hope that this action will benefit the city. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. The tone is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across the board.",
