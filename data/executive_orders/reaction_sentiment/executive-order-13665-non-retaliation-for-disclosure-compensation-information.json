The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that discriminatory practices are being addressed and a more efficient market is being created. There might be some surprise at the directness of the action, and perhaps some fear from those who benefit from the discriminatory practices. There is likely to be disgust at the discriminatory practices that are being addressed. There is little to no sadness or anger being conveyed in the document.",
