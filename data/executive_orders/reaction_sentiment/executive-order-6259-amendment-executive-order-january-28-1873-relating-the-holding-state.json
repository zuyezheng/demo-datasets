    "critique": "The document aims to clarify the scope of a previous executive order, applying it to a broader range of workers. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and clarity, perhaps a mild sense of reassurance that the government is functioning efficiently. There's no strong indication of any intense emotion. The language is formal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low. I will set joy to 3, sadness to 2, fear to 1, disgust to 1, and surprise to 2. After further consideration, I think the intention is to convey a sense of stability and control, so I will adjust the scores slightly to reflect this. Joy remains at 3, sadness at 2, fear at 1, disgust at 1, and surprise at 2.",
