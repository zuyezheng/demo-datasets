    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding pay schedules for various government employees and members of the uniformed services. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are likely related to stability, fairness, and confidence in the government's ability to manage its affairs. There's little room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as these pay adjustments are probably expected. The language is very formal and procedural, reinforcing the lack of strong emotional intent. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon further reflection, while the document itself is unemotional, the *effect* of the document is intended to create a sense of stability and perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction among those receiving pay increases. Therefore, I will adjust the joy score slightly upward. The other scores remain very low.",
