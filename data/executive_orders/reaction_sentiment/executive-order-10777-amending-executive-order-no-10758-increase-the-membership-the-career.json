    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order regarding the Career Executive Board. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary goal is to establish and modify the composition of the board. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the system and perhaps a sense of stability. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being intentionally conveyed. The language is very neutral and focused on the structure of the board.",
