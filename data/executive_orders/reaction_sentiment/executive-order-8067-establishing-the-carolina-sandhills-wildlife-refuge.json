The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from conservation efforts and perhaps a sense of surprise at the scale of the refuge. There might be a touch of sadness for the lands that were acquired, but overall, the tone is positive and forward-looking. There isn't much to suggest fear, disgust, or anger.",
