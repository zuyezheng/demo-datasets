The primary goal seems to be maintaining order and adhering to existing laws regarding appointments. There's no strong indication of an attempt to elicit specific emotions. The language is formal and procedural. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on reducing potential surprise or confusion by clarifying transfer rules.",
