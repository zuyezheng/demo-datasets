    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land withdrawal for classification and potential inclusion in national forests. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources responsibly. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming for a sense of stability and order. There's a subtle element of surprise as the order is enacted, but it's not a major focus. There is no information about anger, fear, disgust, joy, or sadness, so I will score them as 1.",
