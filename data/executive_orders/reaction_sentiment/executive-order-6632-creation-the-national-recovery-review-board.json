The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the government is taking action to protect small businesses and ensure fair competition. There might also be an element of surprise that the President is taking such decisive action. There is a sense of fear that monopolies could take hold, and the President is trying to alleviate that fear. There is also a sense of disgust that monopolies may be forming. There is little sadness or anger conveyed in the document.",
