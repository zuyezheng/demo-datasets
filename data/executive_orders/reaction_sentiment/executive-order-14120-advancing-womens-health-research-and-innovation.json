The tone is generally positive and forward-looking, focusing on progress and future advancements. There's a sense of urgency and determination to address these issues, but not necessarily anger. Fear and disgust are less prominent, as the focus is on solutions and improvements rather than dwelling on negative aspects. Surprise is moderate, as the initiative is presented as a significant step but not entirely unexpected given the ongoing efforts in this area.",
