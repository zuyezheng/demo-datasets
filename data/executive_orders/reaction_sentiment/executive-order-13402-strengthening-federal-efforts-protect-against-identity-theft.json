    "critique": "The document focuses on deterring, preventing, detecting, investigating, and prosecuting identity theft. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (from increased security and protection), and fear (in criminals who might commit identity theft). There might also be a sense of surprise at the government's proactive measures. There is a tone of seriousness and determination, but not necessarily anger, sadness, or disgust. The language is formal and policy-oriented.",
