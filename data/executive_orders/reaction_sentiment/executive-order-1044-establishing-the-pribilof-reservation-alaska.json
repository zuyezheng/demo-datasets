    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing a bird preserve and preventing disturbance of the birds. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (at the preservation of nature) and perhaps a little fear (to deter people from breaking the law). There might be a touch of sadness if people were previously harming the birds, and the order is meant to prevent further sadness. There's probably not much anger, disgust, or surprise intended. The initial scores reflect this, with joy being the highest, followed by fear and sadness, and the others being low. The revised scores are similar, but with a slight increase in fear to emphasize the warning.",
