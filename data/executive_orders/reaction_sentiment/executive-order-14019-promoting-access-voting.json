    "critique": "The document aims to address historical injustices and promote equal access to voting. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for those who will benefit from increased access), and a sense of hope and optimism about the future of democracy. There's also an element of sadness related to the past injustices, and perhaps a touch of anger directed at the obstacles that have prevented equal access. Surprise is less relevant here, as the actions are more about rectifying existing issues than introducing something completely unexpected. Disgust is also less relevant, though there might be a subtle sense of it regarding discriminatory practices. Revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the emotional landscape.",
