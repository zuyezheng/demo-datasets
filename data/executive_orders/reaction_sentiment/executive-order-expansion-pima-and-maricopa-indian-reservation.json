    "critique": "The document focuses on land allocation for the Pima and Maricopa Indians. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of joy and perhaps surprise that their needs are being met, although the language is formal and legalistic. There might also be a degree of sadness acknowledged, given the need for such an order implies past injustices or hardships. There's little to suggest anger, fear, or disgust in the intended emotional response. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
