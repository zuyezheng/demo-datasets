The language used is positive and encouraging, focusing on empowerment and opportunity. There's an element of relief that the government is taking action to address financial literacy. There is little to no indication of negative emotions such as fear, disgust, or anger being intentionally conveyed. Surprise is possible, but not a primary goal.",
