    "critique": "The document describes an executive order to appoint two individuals who were seriously burned while saving Government property. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for helping these individuals and surprise that such an action was necessary. There might also be some sadness for the injuries they sustained. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 3, surprise: 5, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1. Upon further reflection, the element of gratitude and appreciation should be considered, which would increase the joy score. The surprise score might be a bit high, as executive orders are not entirely unexpected. The final scores are joy: 8, sadness: 3, surprise: 4, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1.",
