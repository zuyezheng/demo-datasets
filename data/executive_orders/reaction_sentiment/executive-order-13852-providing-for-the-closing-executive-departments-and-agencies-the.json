    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the closure of federal government offices on December 5, 2018, as a mark of respect for George Herbert Walker Bush. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is sadness and respect for the former president. There might be a sense of surprise due to the sudden closure, but it's mainly about paying respect. The order also aims to ensure smooth functioning of essential services, so there is a need to allay fear. The initial scores reflect these considerations. The revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the intent and impact of the order.",
