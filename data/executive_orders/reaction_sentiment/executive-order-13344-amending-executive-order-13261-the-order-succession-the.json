    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order. The tone is formal and procedural. There is no explicit attempt to elicit any particular emotion. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and legal compliance. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. The initial scores are all 1, indicating a neutral emotional tone. Upon review, this seems appropriate given the nature of the document.",
