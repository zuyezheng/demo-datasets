    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing commercial bribery within the context of the National Industrial Recovery Act. As the President, my primary goal is to instill confidence and clarity regarding the policy. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming to reduce confusion and ensure fair practices. There's an element of reassurance that the order is not intended to disrupt existing industry practices related to premiums, provided they are approved. The emotions I want to elicit are primarily a sense of calm and understanding, with a touch of confidence in the government's ability to address issues effectively. Therefore, I would expect low scores for negative emotions like fear, disgust, and sadness, and moderate scores for joy and surprise, with a focus on reducing confusion and misapprehension.",
