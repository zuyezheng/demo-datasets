    "critique": "The document describes the establishment of a reservation for the Mescalero Apaches and other Indians. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for providing land), and perhaps a reduction in fear and anger (from potential conflicts). There might be some sadness due to the displacement or restrictions, but overall, the goal is to create a sense of stability and peace. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion elicited by this order. Disgust is not relevant in this context.",
