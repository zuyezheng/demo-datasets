    "critique": "The document describes an executive order regarding cooperative education programs. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal seems to be to establish and regulate these programs within the Federal Government. The emotions the President might want to elicit are a sense of order, efficiency, and opportunity. Joy might be present for students getting opportunities. Surprise is likely low as this is a formal order. Disgust, fear, and sadness are probably not intended to be elicited.",
