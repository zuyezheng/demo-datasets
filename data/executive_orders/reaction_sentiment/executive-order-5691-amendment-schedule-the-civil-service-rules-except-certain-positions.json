The primary goal seems to be efficiency and practicality in staffing the Veterans' Administration. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Joy would be minimal, as it's a bureaucratic change. Sadness is unlikely. Anger isn't intended. Fear is not a factor. Disgust is irrelevant. Surprise is also unlikely, as it's a routine adjustment. Revised scores reflect this neutral stance.",
