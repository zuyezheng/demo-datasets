    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is neither strong nor negative. The revocation is a procedural action, and the tone is neutral and formal. Therefore, I would expect low scores for most emotions. Joy might be present if the revocation enables something positive, but it's not explicitly stated. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise is possible, but not probable.",
