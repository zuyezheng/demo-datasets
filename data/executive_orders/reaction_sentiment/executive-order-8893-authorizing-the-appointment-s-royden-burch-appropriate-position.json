The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of approval or acceptance of the appointment, with perhaps a touch of reassurance that the decision is justified. There isn't strong emotional content, so most scores will be low. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.
