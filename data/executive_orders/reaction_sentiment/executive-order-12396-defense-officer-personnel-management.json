As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is confidence in the stability and efficiency of the military's personnel management. There's a sense of order and control I want to convey. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document, so most scores will be low. Joy is not really present. Sadness is not present. Anger is not present. Fear is not present. Disgust is not present. Surprise is not present.",
