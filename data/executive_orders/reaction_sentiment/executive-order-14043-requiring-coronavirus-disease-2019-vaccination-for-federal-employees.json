The document aims to instill a sense of joy through safety and reduced risk, sadness regarding the ongoing pandemic, fear of the virus, and a degree of disgust towards the virus's impact. Surprise is minimal as the measures are presented as necessary and expected. The revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the document's intent, emphasizing the reduction of fear and the promotion of a sense of security and well-being.",
