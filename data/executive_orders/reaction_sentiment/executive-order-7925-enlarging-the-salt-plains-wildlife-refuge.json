    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land withdrawal for wildlife refuge. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy that land is being conserved for wildlife. There might be some sadness from those who lose access to the land, but overall, the tone is neutral and administrative. There's no strong indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise intended. The initial scores reflect this, with joy being the highest and other emotions being low. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable given the document's nature.",
