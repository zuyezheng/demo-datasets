    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of resolve and determination in the face of a threat. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a mix of reassurance (joy), concern (sadness/fear), and perhaps a touch of anger towards the actions of Libya. Surprise is less relevant here, and disgust might be present but not a primary focus. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores adjust the emphasis based on a closer reading of the text. The language is formal and declarative, aiming to project strength and decisiveness.",
