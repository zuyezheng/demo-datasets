    "critique": "The document describes the approval of an agreement within the construction industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the recovery efforts. There's a hint of joy that the agreement complies with the Act and Code. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the agreement was approved.",
