    "critique": "The document is a simple order to reopen East Executive Avenue. The tone is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional appeals. As President, the primary emotion I might hope for is perhaps a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that a public space is being restored for use. However, the order is so mundane that strong emotions are unlikely. The critique is that the initial scores are too high, as the document is unlikely to elicit strong emotions.",
