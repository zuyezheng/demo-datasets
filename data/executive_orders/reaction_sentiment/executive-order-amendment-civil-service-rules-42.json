    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a departmental rule, adding 'Wood engravers' to the list of positions exempt from examination. As president, the primary goal isn't to elicit strong emotions, but rather to efficiently manage the department. The tone is neutral and administrative. Therefore, most emotions would be minimal. However, there might be a slight element of 'surprise' that such a specific role is being addressed in this manner, and perhaps a touch of 'joy' for wood engravers who benefit from this change, but these would be very mild.",
