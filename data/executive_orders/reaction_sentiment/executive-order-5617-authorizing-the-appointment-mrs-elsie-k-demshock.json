    "critique": "The document expresses sympathy for Mrs. Demshock, a widow of a Navy pilot who died in service. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for Mrs. Demshock being appointed to a position, and perhaps some sadness for the loss of her husband. There might be a slight element of surprise that such an exception is being made. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust.",
