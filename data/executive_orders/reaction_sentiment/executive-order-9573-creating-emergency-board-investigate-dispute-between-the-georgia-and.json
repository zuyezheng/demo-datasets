    "critique": "The document describes the creation of a board to investigate a dispute between a railroad company and its employees. The primary goal is to prevent interruption of interstate commerce. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely to be a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly. There is no intention to elicit strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the creation of such boards is a standard procedure. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon further reflection, the document aims to inspire confidence and reduce fear of interrupted service, so I will adjust the fear score slightly downward and the joy score slightly upward to reflect a sense of resolution and stability.",
