The primary goal is to ensure continuity of leadership, not to elicit strong emotional responses. Therefore, the expected emotional responses are likely to be minimal. Initial assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the order aims to provide stability and reassurance in the event of unforeseen circumstances. This might evoke a slight sense of relief or confidence, but not strongly.
