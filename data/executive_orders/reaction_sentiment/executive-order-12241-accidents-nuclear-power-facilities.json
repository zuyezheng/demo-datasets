    "critique": "The document outlines a plan to protect public health and safety in case of nuclear accidents. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of security and confidence that the government is prepared. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to reassure the public. I would expect a moderate amount of fear to be reduced, and a bit of surprise that the plan is being published. The initial scores reflect these considerations. Upon review, I think the initial fear score is too low and should be adjusted upwards to reflect the inherent anxiety around nuclear accidents. The surprise score is also a bit low, as the public might be somewhat surprised to see such a plan being published. The other scores seem reasonable.",
