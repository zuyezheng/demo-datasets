    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for the Navy Department. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is effectively managing resources for national defense. There is no strong emotional language used, so the scores should be relatively low. The order is factual and straightforward, so joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not relevant. Surprise might be a little higher as it is unexpected.",
