    "critique": "The document expresses strong condemnation of North Korea's actions and outlines measures to restrict their access to resources. The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are likely fear (in North Korea), a sense of security and confidence (in the US and allies), and perhaps disgust towards North Korea's behavior. There's also an element of surprise intended, as the measures are designed to be impactful and disruptive. Joy is not a primary emotion sought, nor is sadness. Anger is present, but more as a driver for action than a directly elicited emotion.",
