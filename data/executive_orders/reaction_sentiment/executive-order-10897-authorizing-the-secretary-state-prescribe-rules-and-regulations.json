    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of State regarding the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System. The tone is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional appeals. The primary goal is to ensure the smooth functioning of the retirement system. Therefore, the emotions elicited are likely to be minimal. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all likely to be low. A slight sense of reassurance or confidence might be intended, but it's not strongly conveyed. Revised scores reflect this.",
