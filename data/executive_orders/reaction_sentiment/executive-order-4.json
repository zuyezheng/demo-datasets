    "critique": "The document describes a specific case of a widow with children being reinstated to her position after being separated from it due to marriage. The tone is sympathetic and supportive. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (for Mrs. McLanaham being reinstated) and perhaps some sadness for her unfortunate circumstances. There might be a touch of surprise that the rule was waived, but it's not a strong element. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust.",
