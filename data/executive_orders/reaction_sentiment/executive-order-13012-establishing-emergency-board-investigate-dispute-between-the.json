The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of calm and order, assuring the public and involved parties that the situation is being handled responsibly and according to established legal procedures. There's an element of wanting to project an image of control and adherence to the law. The language is neutral and procedural, aiming to avoid inflaming emotions. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
