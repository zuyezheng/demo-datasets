    "critique": "The document revokes previous land withdrawals in Utah. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief and perhaps a sense of opportunity for those who may now have access to these lands. The tone is formal and legalistic, so strong emotions are unlikely. Joy might be present for those benefiting, but it's not explicitly stated. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely given the nature of the document.",
