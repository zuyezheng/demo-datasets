The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from those who will benefit from this policy. There might be some surprise at the action, but overall, the goal is to create a sense of fairness and reduce sadness and fear among the affected population. Disgust and anger are not intended emotions, but might be present in those who oppose the order.",
