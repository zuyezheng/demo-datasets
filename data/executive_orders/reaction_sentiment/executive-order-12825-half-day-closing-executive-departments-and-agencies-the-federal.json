    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding closing federal offices for half a day on Christmas Eve. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy, by giving federal employees time off during the holidays. There might be a slight element of surprise, but overall, the order is fairly straightforward and practical. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust being conveyed or intended. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
