    "critique": "The document is an executive order that reorganizes and restructures departments to exempt certain subdivisions from the Federal Labor-Management Relations Program due to national security concerns. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect the nation. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey competence and control. Joy is not a primary emotion sought, nor is sadness. Fear and disgust are emotions that might be present in the population already, and this order is meant to reduce those feelings by increasing security. Surprise is not a desired emotion, as the order is intended to be a logical step in ensuring national security.",
