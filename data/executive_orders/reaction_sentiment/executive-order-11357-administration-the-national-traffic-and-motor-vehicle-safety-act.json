    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority for carrying out the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the laws will be carried out effectively. There is little to suggest strong emotions. The order is more about process and delegation than about evoking strong feelings. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across the board. The revised scores will reflect the same, with slight adjustments based on the critique.",
