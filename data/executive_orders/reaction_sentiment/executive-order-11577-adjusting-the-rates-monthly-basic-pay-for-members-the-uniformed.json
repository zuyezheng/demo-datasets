    "critique": "The document is an executive order adjusting the pay for uniformed service members. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, as the pay increase should make the service members happy. There might also be a sense of surprise, as they may not have been expecting the increase. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this document. The tone is formal and authoritative, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression other than a general sense of approval and satisfaction.",
