    "critique": "The document is a simple order to reserve an island for the Smith River Indians. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably joy from the Smith River Indians and perhaps a sense of surprise that the government is acting in their favor. There might be some sadness from those who wanted to use the island for other purposes, but it's likely minimal. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are joy: 6, surprise: 3, sadness: 2, disgust: 1, fear: 1, anger: 1. Upon further reflection, the order is quite limited in scope, so the emotional impact is likely to be muted. The joy and surprise might be less intense than initially thought, and the sadness even less. The revised scores are joy: 4, surprise: 2, sadness: 1, disgust: 1, fear: 1, anger: 1.",
