The primary goal is to ensure a smooth and lawful transfer of responsibilities. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. However, a sense of order and closure might bring a slight feeling of joy to those who support the commission's work. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. A slight surprise might be present for those unaware of the commission's termination.",
