    "critique": "The document is a short amendment to civil service rules regarding positions in the National Soldiers' Home. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in government, and perhaps a subtle sense of gratitude or satisfaction that veterans are being taken care of. However, the document is very specific and doesn't convey strong emotions. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.
