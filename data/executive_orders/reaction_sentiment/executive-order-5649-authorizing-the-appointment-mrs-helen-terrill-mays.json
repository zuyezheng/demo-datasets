    "critique": "The document describes a situation where a widow is being appointed to a clerical position to provide her with means of support after her husband's death. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that someone is being helped in a time of need. There might also be some sadness associated with the death of the husband. There isn't any indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 5, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the joy might be a bit overstated. The document is more about providing support and less about celebrating a joyous occasion. The sadness is appropriate given the circumstances. The other emotions remain at 1.",
