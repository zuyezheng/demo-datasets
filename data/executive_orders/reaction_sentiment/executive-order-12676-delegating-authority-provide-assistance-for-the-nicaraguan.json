    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the transfer of funds and delegation of authority related to the Bipartisan Accord on Central America. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to manage foreign assistance and maintain stability in Central America. However, the document itself is very procedural and doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low across the board. The critique is that the initial scores are too low, especially for joy and surprise. The revised scores reflect a slightly more positive outlook, with a small increase in joy and surprise.",
