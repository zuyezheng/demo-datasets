    "critique": "The document is an executive order transferring officers from the Coast and Geodetic Survey to the War Department during a national emergency. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to reassurance, confidence, and a sense of national unity during a time of crisis. There isn't much emotional language in the document itself; it's mostly a legal and administrative order. Therefore, the scores will be relatively low, with a slight emphasis on reassurance (joy) and a mitigation of fear.",
