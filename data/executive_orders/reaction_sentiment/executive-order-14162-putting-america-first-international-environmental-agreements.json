    "critique": "The document aims to evoke joy and pride in American citizens by prioritizing their interests and economic prosperity. It also intends to instill a sense of security by emphasizing the protection of American jobs and resources. There might be some sadness or disappointment among those who supported the previous international agreements, but the overall tone is assertive and confident. There is a slight sense of disgust towards the previous agreements that are seen as unfavorable to the US. Surprise is not a primary emotion being conveyed.",
