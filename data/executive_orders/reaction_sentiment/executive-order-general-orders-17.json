    "critique": "The document is a military order reassigning Major-General Hancock. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is acceptance and understanding of the chain of command. There is no explicit emotion being conveyed, but the reassignment could cause surprise or sadness in some. The tone is formal and direct, suggesting a focus on duty and order rather than emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores would be low across all emotions.",
