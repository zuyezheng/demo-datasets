The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (at the preservation of wildlife), and perhaps a bit of surprise (at the scale of the refuge). There might be a touch of sadness for those who can no longer hunt/trap in the area, and potentially fear/disgust from those who dislike government intervention. However, the overall tone is one of positive action and conservation.",
