The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who value natural resources. There might be some sadness from those who lose access to these lands for other purposes, but the overall tone is one of positive action for the environment. There is no anger, fear, or disgust evident in the document. Surprise is possible, but not a primary emotion.",
