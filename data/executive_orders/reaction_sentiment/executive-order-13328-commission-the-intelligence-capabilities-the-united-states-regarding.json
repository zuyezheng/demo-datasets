The order aims to address past intelligence failures and prevent future ones. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security (low fear), confidence (some joy), and perhaps a sense of seriousness (low sadness). There might be a slight element of surprise that such a commission is being established, but it's not a primary emotion. Disgust and anger are not emotions the President is trying to elicit.",
