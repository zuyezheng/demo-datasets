    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on resolving a labor dispute and maintaining essential transportation services. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire to project an image of calm authority and impartiality. The revised scores reflect a slight adjustment to emphasize the element of surprise, as the creation of a board to investigate the dispute might be unexpected by some parties involved.",
