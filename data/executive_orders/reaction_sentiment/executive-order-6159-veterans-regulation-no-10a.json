As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise, as the order expands benefits to children of veterans and makes exceptions for pensioners working for the government. I also want to reduce fear and sadness by ensuring veterans receive fair treatment. Disgust and anger are not emotions I want to elicit.
