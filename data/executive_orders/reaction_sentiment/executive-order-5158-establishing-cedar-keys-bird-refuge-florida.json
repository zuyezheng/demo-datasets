    "critique": "The document aims to protect birds and their habitat. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who appreciate nature. There might be some sadness from those who can no longer hunt or use the land as they did before. There could be anger from those who feel their rights are being infringed upon. Fear could be elicited in those who might break the law unintentionally. Disgust is unlikely to be a primary emotion, but some might feel it towards those who damage the environment. Surprise is also unlikely to be a strong emotion.",
