    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order. The primary goal is to ensure the Maritime Administration remains subject to the Agreement on Government Procurement despite its transfer between departments. The tone is purely administrative and legal, with no explicit emotional appeal. The language is formal and technical, focusing on legal authority and specific actions. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on surprise that this change was not already in place.",
