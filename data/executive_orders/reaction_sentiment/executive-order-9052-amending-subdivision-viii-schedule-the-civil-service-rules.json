    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to the Civil Service Rules, adding a position. There's no inherent emotional content in such an administrative action. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is perhaps a sense of order and efficiency in governance, but that's a very weak signal. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, I still believe the emotional content is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
