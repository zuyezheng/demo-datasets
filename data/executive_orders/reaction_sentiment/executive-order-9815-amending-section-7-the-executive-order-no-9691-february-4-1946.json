    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding civil service employment. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and order within the government. The language is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are likely minimal. Surprise might be slightly higher due to the amendment itself, but overall, the emotional intensity is low.",
