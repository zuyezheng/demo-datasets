    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and stability, but the document itself is quite neutral. There's no strong emotional appeal intended. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will start with initial scores of: joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think a slight sense of assurance might evoke a tiny bit of joy and surprise that the government is acting. So, I will revise those slightly upward.",
