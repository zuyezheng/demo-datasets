    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, increasing the membership of a presidential commission. As such, it's unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and perhaps a slight sense of progress in addressing drunk driving. There's no language suggesting joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely given the routine nature of the amendment. Therefore, initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, I believe the initial scores accurately reflect the emotional impact of the document.",
