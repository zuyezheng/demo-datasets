    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the stabilization of wages, prices, and salaries. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in the government's handling of the economy. The revocation of section 3 of Executive Order No. 9328 suggests a change in policy, and I want people to feel that this change is being made to improve the situation. There is not enough information to determine the intensity of each emotion. Therefore, I will assign a default score of 1 to each emotion.",
