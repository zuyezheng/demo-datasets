    "critique": "The document is a legal order, so the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to trust and confidence in the legal system. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so I will have to infer them from the context and tone. The tone is formal and authoritative, which suggests a desire to inspire confidence and respect for the law. The changes are meant to be fair and not retroactive, which should reduce fear and anger. There is not enough information to suggest strong emotions, so the scores will be relatively low.",
