    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding customs collection districts in Michigan. The tone is official and bureaucratic. The primary goal is to announce changes to customs ports of entry. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. However, the order might bring a sense of joy to the city of Muskegon, which is newly designated as a customs port of entry, and perhaps sadness or disappointment to Grand Haven, which loses its designation. Surprise is unlikely, as such decisions are probably anticipated within the relevant circles. Fear, disgust, and anger are not relevant in this context. The intensity of joy and sadness would likely be moderate, as these are localized economic and administrative changes.",
