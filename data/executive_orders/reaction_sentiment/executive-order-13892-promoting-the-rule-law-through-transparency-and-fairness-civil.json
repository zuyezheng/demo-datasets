The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (from regulated parties feeling secure and fairly treated) and surprise (from agencies that have not been compliant). There might be some sadness from those who benefited from the previous lack of transparency, and fear and disgust from those who might have been taking advantage of the system. However, the overall tone is one of promoting positive change and fairness.",
