    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding the preservation of the White House. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the preservation of a national treasure. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and administrative, suggesting a focus on order and process rather than emotional impact. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on confidence-inspiring emotions.",
