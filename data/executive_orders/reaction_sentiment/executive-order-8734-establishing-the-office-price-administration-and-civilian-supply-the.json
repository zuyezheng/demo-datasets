The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through ensuring adequate supply and equitable distribution), and reduced fear (by preventing profiteering and price rises). There's also an element of addressing potential disgust (by preventing profiteering). Surprise is less relevant here. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
