    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise that the United States is taking action to help families. There may also be some sadness that this was not done sooner. There is no anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 3, surprise: 5, disgust: 1, fear: 1, anger: 1. Upon further review, the document is very procedural and does not convey strong emotions. The revised scores are joy: 4, sadness: 2, surprise: 3, disgust: 1, fear: 1, anger: 1.",
