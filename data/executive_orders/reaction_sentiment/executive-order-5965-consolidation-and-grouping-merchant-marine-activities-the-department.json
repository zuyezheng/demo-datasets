The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (from increased efficiency) and surprise (at the scale of the reorganization). There might be some fear or sadness from those whose roles are changed, but the overall tone is positive and forward-looking. Disgust and anger are unlikely to be intended emotions.",
