    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of John H. Dillon. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and trust in his decision-making and the competence of the appointee. There might be a slight element of surprise that the usual rules are being waived, but it's presented as justified. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
