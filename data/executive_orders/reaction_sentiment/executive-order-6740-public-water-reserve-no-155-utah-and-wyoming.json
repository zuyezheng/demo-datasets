    "critique": "The document is a legal order withdrawing land from settlement. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the land is being protected for public use. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of calm and trust is desired. The language is formal and legal, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, I think a slight increase in 'joy' might be warranted, as the preservation of public lands can bring a sense of satisfaction and well-being to the public. Also, a slight increase in 'surprise' might be warranted, as the public may not have expected this action.",
