    "critique": "The document establishes a commission to assist the President in filling vacancies on the United States Tax Court. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (in the sense of confidence and satisfaction that the process will be handled well) and perhaps a bit of surprise that such a commission is being established. There's also an element of reducing fear by ensuring qualified individuals are nominated. There isn't much sadness, anger, or disgust associated with this document.",
