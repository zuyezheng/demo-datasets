    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, allowing National Park Service employees to serve as unpaid deputy sheriffs with the Secretary of the Interior's approval, as long as it doesn't interfere with their primary duties. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of reassurance and perhaps mild approval or satisfaction that the government is being efficient and responsive to local needs. There's no strong language to suggest intense emotions. Joy is low, as it's a bureaucratic adjustment. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are all minimal, as the order is unlikely to provoke these emotions. Surprise might be slightly higher, as it's a change, but not a dramatic one. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3",
