    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the regulation of interstate and foreign commerce in petroleum. The tone is authoritative and legalistic. The primary goal is to delegate authority and ensure compliance with existing laws. There is little emotional content, but a sense of order and control might evoke a mild sense of joy or relief that things are being handled properly. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
