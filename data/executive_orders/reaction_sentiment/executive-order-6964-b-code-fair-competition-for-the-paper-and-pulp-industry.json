    "critique": "The document is an amendment to the Code of Fair Competition for the Paper and Pulp Industry. As the President, I would want to elicit feelings of joy and perhaps surprise that wages are being addressed. However, there might be sadness or disgust from those who feel the changes are not enough or are unfair. There might also be fear from employers about the increased wages. The language is formal and legalistic, so the emotions are likely to be muted. Initial scores: joy: 5, sadness: 3, anger: 2, fear: 3, disgust: 2, surprise: 4. Upon further reflection, the document is primarily about adjusting wages, so the emotional impact is likely to be more moderate. The joy and surprise might be slightly overstated, while the negative emotions might be slightly understated. Revised scores: joy: 4, sadness: 4, anger: 3, fear: 4, disgust: 3, surprise: 3.",
