    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for a power transmission line. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably a sense of assurance and perhaps mild surprise that the government is taking action to provide power. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust in this context. The language is formal and procedural, so I'll start with low scores for most emotions and a slightly higher score for surprise.",
