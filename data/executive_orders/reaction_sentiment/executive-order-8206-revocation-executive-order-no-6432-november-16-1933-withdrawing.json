    "critique": "The document revokes a previous executive order and makes the change effective upon the filing of resurvey plats. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency, perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that administrative processes are being updated. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.
