    "critique": "The document is a formal order about land inclusion in a National Forest. The tone is official and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources responsibly. There's no strong indication of intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The emotions conveyed are very mild, and the document is more about administrative action than emotional appeal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across all emotions.",
