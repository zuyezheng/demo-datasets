As the author, the President, the primary emotion to elicit is a sense of fairness and clarity. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for transparency and order. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a desired emotion, as the document aims to provide clear guidelines.",
