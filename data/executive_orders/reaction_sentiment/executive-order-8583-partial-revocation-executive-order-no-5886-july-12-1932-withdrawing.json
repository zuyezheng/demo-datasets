    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous order regarding public lands in Wyoming. As the author, the President, I don't have strong emotions I want to elicit. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and clarity. There's no inherent emotional content in the act of revoking a land withdrawal for resurvey purposes. The tone is formal and factual, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, most emotions would be rated low. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, there might be a slight element of 'surprise' for those directly affected by the land resurvey, but it's still minimal. I will revise the surprise score to 2.",
