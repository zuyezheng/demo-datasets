    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing domestic violence and disorder. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of restored order and security. The tone is authoritative and decisive, aiming to convey control and resolve. I want to instill fear in those causing violence, and joy/relief in those affected by it. There is also an element of sadness due to the situation requiring such measures, and perhaps surprise at the extent of the actions needed. Disgust at the violence is also present. The initial scores reflect these considerations, but the revised scores adjust the intensity based on a more careful reading, increasing the emphasis on fear and reducing the surprise.",
