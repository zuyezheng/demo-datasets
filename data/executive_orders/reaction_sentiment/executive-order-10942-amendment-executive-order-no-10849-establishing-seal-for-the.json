    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order regarding the description of NASA's seal. The tone is official and administrative. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to legally update the seal's description. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust are likely minimal. Surprise might be slightly higher due to the change itself, but still relatively low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
