    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the land is being managed responsibly. However, the document is very dry and formal, so it's unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to inspire emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After revision, I will adjust the surprise score to reflect the unexpected nature of the order.",
