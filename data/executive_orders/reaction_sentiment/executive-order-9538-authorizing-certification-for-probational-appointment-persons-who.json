    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on civil service appointments for veterans. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from veterans who will benefit from this order, and perhaps a sense of surprise that such an order is being enacted. There's little to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
