The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who appreciate nature. There might be some sadness from those who lose access to the land, but the overall tone is positive and focused on preservation. There is no anger, fear, or disgust intended. Surprise is possible, but not a primary goal.",
