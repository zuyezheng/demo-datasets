    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding a change in the name and boundaries of a customs port. The tone is official and procedural. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are minimal. There's no intention to evoke strong feelings. The actions are administrative and unlikely to generate significant emotional responses. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight element of 'surprise' for those directly affected by the change, but even that would be minimal. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
