    "critique": "The document outlines the designation of members to military tribunals for the trial and punishment of major war criminals. The tone is formal and authoritative, reflecting the President's duty to ensure justice and maintain order. The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are a sense of justice, order, and resolve. There is an element of fear and disgust towards the actions of the war criminals, but the document focuses on the process of justice rather than dwelling on these emotions. Surprise is not a significant factor.",
