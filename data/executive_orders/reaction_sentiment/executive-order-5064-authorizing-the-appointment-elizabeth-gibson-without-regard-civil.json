    "critique": "The document is a presidential order regarding the employment of Miss Elizabeth Gibson. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for Miss Gibson and perhaps gratitude from her family. There might be a slight element of surprise that the Civil Service Commission does not concur. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable and no changes are necessary.",
