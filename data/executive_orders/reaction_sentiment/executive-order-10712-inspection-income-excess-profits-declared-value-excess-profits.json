    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are related to trust, confidence in the government's operations, and a sense of order and adherence to the law. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so I must infer them from the context and tone. Joy is unlikely to be a direct emotion elicited, so it will be low. Sadness is also unlikely. Anger could be present in those who disagree with the policy, but I am trying to convey a sense of duty. Fear is not the intention, but some may fear investigation. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is possible, but the order is more about procedure. Revised scores will reflect a more nuanced understanding of the intended and potential emotional impact.",
