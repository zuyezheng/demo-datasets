    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of Frances Perkins from compulsory retirement. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in their decision-making. There's a tone of authority and public interest. Joy is not a primary emotion here, nor is sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is more about administrative action than emotional expression. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, as the document is largely devoid of strong emotional cues. The revised scores remain the same.",
