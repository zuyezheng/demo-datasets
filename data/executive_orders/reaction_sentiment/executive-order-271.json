    "critique": "The document expresses a somber tone related to remembering fallen soldiers. It aims to evoke feelings of respect and remembrance, with a touch of sadness for the loss. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is sadness, with a secondary emotion of respect which can be interpreted as a low level of joy. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the highest, followed by joy, and the other emotions being minimal. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, but I will slightly adjust the joy score to better reflect the respect conveyed.",
