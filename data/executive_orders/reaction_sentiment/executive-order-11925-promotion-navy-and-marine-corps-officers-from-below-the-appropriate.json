    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order, extending it by a couple of years. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of stability and continuity in government operations, but this is very subtle. Therefore, the initial scores are mostly low, with a slight emphasis on stability (low fear and sadness). The critique is that the initial scores might be too neutral. Revised scores reflect a slightly more positive outlook, with a touch of hope (joy) and reduced fear/sadness.",
