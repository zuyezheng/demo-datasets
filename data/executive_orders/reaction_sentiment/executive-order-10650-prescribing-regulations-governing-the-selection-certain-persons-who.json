As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of order, efficiency, and national security. The primary emotions I want to elicit are trust and confidence in the system. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on procedures and authority. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
