The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability. There is a slight hint of joy that the code has been approved and that the National Industrial Recovery Act is working as intended. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the code was approved so quickly.",
