    "critique": "The document expresses approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Bottled Soft Drink Industry. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the industry is being regulated in a fair manner. There may also be an element of surprise that the code was approved so quickly. There is little to no sadness, anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. The initial scores are joy: 7, surprise: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is primarily a formal approval, so the emotions are likely more muted. The revised scores are joy: 5, surprise: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1.",
