    "critique": "The document is a formal delegation of authority regarding the promotion of officers in the Naval Reserve and Marine Corps Reserve. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary goal is efficiency and proper governance, not to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is neutral and legalistic. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on surprise due to the nature of executive orders.",
