    "critique": "The document establishes the Presidential Citizens Medal to recognize exemplary service. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for those being recognized and perhaps a sense of pride and inspiration in the country. There might be a touch of surprise for the recipients. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, with joy being the highest, followed by surprise, and the others being minimal. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, but I will slightly adjust the surprise score to better reflect the context.",
