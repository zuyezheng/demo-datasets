    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1. The tone is authoritative and legalistic. The primary goal is to enact a policy change, not to elicit strong emotions. However, some emotions might be indirectly conveyed. Joy might be present in those who support conservation and resource management. Sadness or anger might be felt by those who are restricted by the order. Fear and disgust are unlikely to be relevant. Surprise is possible if the order was unexpected. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
