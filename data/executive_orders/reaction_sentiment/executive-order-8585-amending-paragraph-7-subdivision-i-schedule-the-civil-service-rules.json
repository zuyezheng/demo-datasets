    "critique": "The document discusses amendments to the Civil Service Rules regarding employment in foreign countries and US territories. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and order in the government's operations, and perhaps a bit of relief that these rules are being clarified. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document. The tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all likely to be minimal. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think a slight sense of reassurance might be conveyed, so I will adjust the joy score to 2. The other scores remain the same.",
