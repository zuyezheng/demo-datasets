    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for military use. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and security, with perhaps a hint of confidence in the government's ability to manage resources. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, so the initial scores should be low, reflecting the neutral tone. However, a slight sense of security might translate to a low joy score, and the potential displacement of people could lead to a low sadness score. The initial scores are: joy: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon review, the document is very neutral and elicits almost no emotion. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this.",
