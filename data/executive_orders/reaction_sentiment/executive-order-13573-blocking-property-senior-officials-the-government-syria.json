    "critique": "The document expresses a strong stance against the Syrian government's violence and repression. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of justice and perhaps a degree of fear in those supporting the Syrian government. There's also an element of sadness for the victims of the violence. Surprise is less relevant here, and disgust is present but not as prominent as the other emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
