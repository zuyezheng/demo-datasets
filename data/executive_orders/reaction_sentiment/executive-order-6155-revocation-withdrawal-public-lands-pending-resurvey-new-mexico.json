    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land use. It revokes a previous order and opens land for homesteading by ex-service men. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of fairness and opportunity, especially for veterans. There's a hint of joy in providing opportunities, but also a potential for sadness if people can't take advantage of it. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, but I'll revise them to better capture the subtle emotions.",
