    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Dr. Lawrence W. White from compulsory retirement. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably a sense of stability and confidence in my leadership. The language is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to project competence and control. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document, as it's a procedural matter. Therefore, most emotions would be rated low. Joy would be low as it is not a happy occasion, sadness would be low as it is not a sad occasion, anger would be low as it is not an angry occasion, fear would be low as it is not a fearful occasion, disgust would be low as it is not a disgusting occasion and surprise would be low as it is not a surprising occasion.",
