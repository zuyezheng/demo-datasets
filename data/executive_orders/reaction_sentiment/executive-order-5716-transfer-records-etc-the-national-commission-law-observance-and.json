    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the transfer of records from the National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement to the Department of Justice and eventually to a permanent government records building. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to order, efficiency, and proper governance. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The emotions conveyed are minimal, so initial scores will be low.",
