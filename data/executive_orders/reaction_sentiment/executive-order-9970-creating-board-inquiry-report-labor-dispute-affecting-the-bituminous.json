    "critique": "The document expresses concern about a labor dispute in the coal industry and its potential impact on national health and safety. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of reassurance and confidence that the situation is being handled responsibly. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of control and determination to resolve the dispute. The language is carefully chosen to emphasize the importance of the coal industry and the potential consequences of a strike or lockout. The creation of a Board of Inquiry is intended to demonstrate a proactive approach to addressing the issue and finding a solution. The emotions are scored based on the intensity conveyed in the document, with higher scores indicating a stronger presence of that emotion. The initial scores are based on my first impression of the document's emotional impact. After further reflection, I have revised the scores to better reflect the nuances of the document's emotional tone and intent.",
