    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and resolution, assuring the public that the situation is being handled. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey stability and control. There's an element of surprise in the sense that the government is intervening, but it's not a strong emotion. There's a slight element of fear that the dispute could disrupt transportation, but the order aims to alleviate that fear. There's no explicit joy, sadness, or disgust conveyed. The initial scores reflect these considerations. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I'll slightly adjust the surprise and fear scores to better reflect the context.",
