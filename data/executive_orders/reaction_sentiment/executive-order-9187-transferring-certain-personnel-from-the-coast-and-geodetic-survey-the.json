    "critique": "The document is an executive order transferring officers from the Coast and Geodetic Survey to the War and Navy Departments due to a national emergency. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security that the government is taking necessary actions during a crisis. The tone is formal and authoritative, reflecting the gravity of the situation. There's an implicit sense of urgency and resolve. Joy is not a relevant emotion in this context. Sadness might be present due to the emergency, but it's not the primary focus. Anger is not intended. Fear might be a natural reaction to a national emergency, but the order aims to mitigate it by showing decisive action. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is possible, but the order is meant to be a calculated response, not a shock. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 3, Anger: 1, Fear: 4, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
