    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and decisiveness, but the intensity is low as it's a routine administrative action. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are all likely low. Surprise might be slightly higher if the revocation was unexpected, but still not significant.",
