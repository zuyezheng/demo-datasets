    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on revoking previous orders related to trade restrictions with Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is relief or perhaps a sense of progress, but the document itself is not designed to evoke strong emotions. The language is very specific and procedural, aiming for clarity and legal precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, most emotions would be relatively low. Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The revision reflects a more accurate assessment that the document is unlikely to evoke surprise.",
