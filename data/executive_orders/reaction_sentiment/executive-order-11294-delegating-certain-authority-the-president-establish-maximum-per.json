    "critique": "The document is a series of amendments and delegations of authority related to travel expenses. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotions the President might want to elicit are trust and confidence in the efficient functioning of the government. However, the document itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The joy score is slightly increased to reflect the positive outcome of efficient government.",
