The primary goal is to make a minor change (increasing a number from two to three). There's no strong emotional appeal intended. The emotions conveyed are very minimal, as it's a procedural update. Initial scores: disgust=1, fear=1, joy=1, sadness=1, surprise=1. Revised scores: disgust=1, fear=1, joy=1, sadness=1, surprise=1.",
