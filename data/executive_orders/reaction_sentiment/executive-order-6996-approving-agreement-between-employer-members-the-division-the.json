    "critique": "The document describes the approval of an agreement between employers and employees in the construction industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the agreement has been approved and that the National Industrial Recovery Act is working as intended. There may also be a sense of relief that the agreement has been reached and that the construction industry is moving forward. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
