    "critique": "The document describes the approval of an agreement within the construction industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the recovery efforts. There's a hint of joy in seeing the agreement approved and implemented, and perhaps a touch of surprise that it has come to fruition. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust.",
