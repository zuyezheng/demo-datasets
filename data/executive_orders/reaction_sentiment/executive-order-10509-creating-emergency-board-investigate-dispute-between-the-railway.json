    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute between the Railway Express Agency and its employees. As the President, the primary goal is to resolve the dispute and prevent disruption to interstate commerce. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of control and resolution. The language is legalistic and precise, focusing on the facts of the situation and the actions being taken. There is little emotional expression in the document, as it is a formal declaration of action. The emotions the President wants to elicit are primarily related to reassurance and stability, not strong displays of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with slight emphasis on reducing fear and surprise by providing a clear course of action. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the intent to reduce fear and increase a sense of calm.",
