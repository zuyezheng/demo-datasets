    "critique": "The document focuses on Mrs. Harring's appointment and her late husband's contributions. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy for Mrs. Harring's new opportunity and perhaps some sadness for the loss of her husband, but also appreciation for his work. There might be a touch of surprise at the unusual nature of the appointment, but overall, the tone is respectful and appreciative. Disgust, fear, and anger are not relevant in this context, so they should be scored as 1.",
