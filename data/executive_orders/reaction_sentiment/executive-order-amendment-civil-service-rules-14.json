    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous rule, specifically regarding the hiring of kindergarten teachers for Native American schools. The tone is administrative and bureaucratic. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably a mild sense of satisfaction or approval that the government is providing education to Native American children. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy might be a 2, as it's a positive action. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust would be 1, as they are not relevant. Surprise might be a 1 as well, since it's a routine amendment.",
