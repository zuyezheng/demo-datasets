    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of international organizations and aims to establish their privileges and immunities. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order, and perhaps a mild sense of reassurance that international cooperation is being maintained. There's no strong indication of intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire for respect and compliance rather than strong emotional engagement. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on joy as it relates to positive international cooperation.",
