    "critique": "The document is a military order, so the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence and reassurance in the command structure. Joy is unlikely to be a primary emotion, but a sense of hope for improved outcomes might be present. Sadness is unlikely, but acknowledging the change for Halleck might have a tinge of it. Fear and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise might be present due to the changes in command.",
