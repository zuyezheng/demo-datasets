    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the Provisional Intergovernmental Committee for the Movement of Migrants from Europe as a public international organization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and assurance that the United States is fulfilling its international obligations and participating in important global initiatives. There is no explicit mention of emotions. The document is primarily administrative in nature.",
