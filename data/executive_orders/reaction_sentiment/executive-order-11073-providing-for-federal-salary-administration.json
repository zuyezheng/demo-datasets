The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (from fair treatment and recognition), and perhaps a reduction in fear (of unfair pay or lack of opportunity). There might be a touch of surprise if the changes are significant, but overall, the tone is professional and focused on practical improvements. Disgust and anger are unlikely to be intended emotions.",
