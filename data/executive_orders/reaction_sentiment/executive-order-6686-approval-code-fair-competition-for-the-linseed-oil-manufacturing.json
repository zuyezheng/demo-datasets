    "critique": "The document is an executive order approving a code of fair competition for the Linseed Oil Manufacturing Industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the economy and the government's ability to manage it. There is a sense of joy that the policy of Congress is being effectuated. There is a sense of surprise that the code authority will submit a study of the hours of labor, rates of pay, and other conditions of employment within this Industry, with the view of revising the wages, hours, and other conditions of employment as set forth in this Code. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust.",
