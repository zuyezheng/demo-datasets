The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order, perhaps a mild sense of reassurance that the government is functioning properly. There's no indication of strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality.",
