    "critique": "The document outlines procedures for issuing certificates of protection to vessels in Puerto Rico, focusing on allegiance to the United States. The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are joy (through the extension of protection and privileges), and perhaps a reduction of fear and surprise by establishing clear guidelines. There might be a slight element of sadness for those having to abjure allegiance to Spain, but the overall tone is one of establishing order and extending benefits. Disgust and anger are not prominent emotions in this context.",
