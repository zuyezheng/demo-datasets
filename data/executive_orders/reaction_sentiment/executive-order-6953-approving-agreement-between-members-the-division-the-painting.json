    "critique": "The document expresses approval of an agreement and aims to convey a sense of order, compliance, and fairness. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (in the sense of satisfaction that the system is working) and perhaps a bit of surprise that things are going smoothly. There's little to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and bureaucratic, emphasizing adherence to regulations and procedures. The tone is authoritative and decisive, reflecting the President's role in overseeing the implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy and surprise being moderately high, and the other emotions being low. Upon further reflection, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will adjust them slightly to better reflect the nuances of the document. I will increase joy and surprise slightly, and leave the other emotions as they are.",
