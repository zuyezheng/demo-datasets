    "critique": "The document focuses on addressing an emergency and protecting American citizens. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to handle the situation. There might be a secondary emotion of relief. The tone is formal and decisive, aiming to reassure rather than incite strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with a moderate level of joy (relief) and low levels of other emotions. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, but I will adjust the joy score slightly upwards to reflect the sense of relief the President intends to convey.",
