    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding the grades and ratings of enlisted men in the Regular Army. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary goal is to implement changes to the grades and ratings, not to elicit strong emotions. The document focuses on specifying the new grades and maximum numbers, suggesting a desire for order and structure. There is little to suggest any strong emotions being conveyed. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
