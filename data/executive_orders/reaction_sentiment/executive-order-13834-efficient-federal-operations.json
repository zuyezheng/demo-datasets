The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (from achieving goals and improving the environment) and perhaps a sense of reduced fear (related to environmental concerns). There might be a slight element of surprise at the scale of the changes, but overall, the tone is measured and focused on practical outcomes. There's little to suggest anger, disgust, or sadness as intended responses.",
