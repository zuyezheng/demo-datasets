    "critique": "The document is an order abolishing the military governorship of Arkansas. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy that the state is being returned to civilian rule. There might be some sadness from those who benefited from the military government, but overall, the goal is to convey a sense of progress and restoration of normal governance. There is no anger, fear, or disgust intended. There might be a slight surprise for those not expecting this order.",
