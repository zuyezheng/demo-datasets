    "critique": "The document focuses on improving federal employee training through technology. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through improved opportunities and skills), and perhaps a sense of reduced fear (of being left behind by technology). There might be a slight element of surprise at the innovative approaches. Sadness, anger, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon further reflection, the element of surprise might be a bit higher, as the changes are intended to be innovative. Also, there might be a slight reduction in fear, as employees are given the tools to succeed in a changing workplace.",
