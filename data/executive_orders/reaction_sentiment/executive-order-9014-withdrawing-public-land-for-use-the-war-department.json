    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing land for aviation purposes during wartime. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security (low fear, some joy from national security), with a touch of surprise at the swift action. There's no indication of sadness, disgust, or anger being conveyed or desired. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the 'surprise' to acknowledge the decisiveness of the order.",
