    "critique": "The document expresses a desire to alleviate 'undue hardship' caused by existing agreements. This suggests an intent to evoke joy by providing relief and reducing potential sadness or anger arising from the hardships. The language is formal and bureaucratic, indicating a focus on procedure rather than strong emotional appeals. Therefore, emotions like fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be intentionally elicited. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy being moderately emphasized and other emotions receiving low scores. The revised scores slightly adjust the emphasis on joy and sadness based on the explicit mention of 'undue hardship'.",
