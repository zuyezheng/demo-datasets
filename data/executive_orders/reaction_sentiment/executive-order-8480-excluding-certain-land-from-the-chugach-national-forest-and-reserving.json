    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land in Alaska. The primary goal seems to be logistical - setting aside land for townsite purposes related to railroad construction. There isn't a strong emotional component to the document. The tone is formal and legalistic. Therefore, I would expect low scores for all emotions. I will revise the surprise score to be slightly higher as the audience may not have expected this order.",
