    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on setting pay scales for various government employees and members of the uniformed services. As such, the primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and fairness. There's not a lot of room for strong emotions like joy or sadness, but a sense of calm and perhaps mild satisfaction would be ideal. There is no anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise at the changes, but it's likely minimal.",
