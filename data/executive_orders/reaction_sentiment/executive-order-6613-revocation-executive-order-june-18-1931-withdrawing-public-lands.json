However, by prioritizing ex-service men, it subtly aims to inspire joy and gratitude in them, while potentially causing slight sadness or disappointment in others who might have hoped to acquire the land. The revocation of the previous order might cause a bit of surprise. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust being intentionally conveyed.",
