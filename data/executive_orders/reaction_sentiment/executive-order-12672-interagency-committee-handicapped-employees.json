    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on amending an existing executive order related to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The changes involve updating the list of members in a committee. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Joy: The document doesn't aim to create joy, so a low score is appropriate. Sadness: Similarly, the document doesn't aim to create sadness. Anger: The document is unlikely to evoke anger. Fear: The document is unlikely to evoke fear. Disgust: The document is unlikely to evoke disgust. Surprise: The changes are minor and unlikely to cause surprise, so a low score is appropriate.",
