    "critique": "The document is a land withdrawal order. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage public lands effectively. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy might be present in the sense of preserving land for public use, but it's not explicitly stated. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited by this document. Surprise is also unlikely, as land withdrawals are a routine governmental function. Revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the document's potential emotional impact.",
