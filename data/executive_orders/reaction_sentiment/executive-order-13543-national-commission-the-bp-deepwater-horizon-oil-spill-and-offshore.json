    "critique": "The document aims to address a disaster, so it will likely evoke sadness and perhaps some fear or anger related to the event. However, the primary goal is to inspire confidence and a sense of action, so there should be some element of hope or at least a reduction of fear through the establishment of the commission. The language is formal and procedural, which suggests a desire to project competence and control rather than strong emotional appeals. The document does not explicitly aim to evoke joy, disgust, or surprise.",
