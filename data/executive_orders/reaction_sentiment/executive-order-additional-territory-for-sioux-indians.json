    "critique": "The document is an executive order that withdraws land from sale and sets it apart for the use of Sioux Indians. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise from the Sioux Indians, and perhaps a reduction in fear and sadness. There might be some disgust or anger from those who wanted to purchase the land, but that is secondary. The tone is formal and legalistic, so the emotions are somewhat muted. Initial scores: joy: 6, sadness: 3, anger: 3, fear: 3, disgust: 2, surprise: 4. Critique: The joy score might be a bit high, as the language is not explicitly joyful. Surprise might also be a bit high. Revised scores: joy: 5, sadness: 3, anger: 3, fear: 3, disgust: 2, surprise: 3.",
