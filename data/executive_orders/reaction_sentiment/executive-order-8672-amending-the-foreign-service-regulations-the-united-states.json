    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding foreign service regulations related to navigation, vessels, aircraft, and seamen. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary goal seems to be to delegate authority to the Secretary of State to issue instructions and to cancel outdated regulations. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document. The emotions I want to elicit are: minimal surprise that I am delegating authority, and minimal joy that the regulations are being updated. The other emotions are not relevant.",
