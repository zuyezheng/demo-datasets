    "critique": "The document aims to project an image of decisive action and authority. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to address international issues. There might also be an element of fear directed towards those who might violate the order. The language is formal and legalistic, which contributes to the sense of authority. The actions described are intended to isolate UNITA and limit their resources, which could evoke feelings of disgust towards their actions. Surprise is less relevant here, as the order is a continuation of existing policies.",
