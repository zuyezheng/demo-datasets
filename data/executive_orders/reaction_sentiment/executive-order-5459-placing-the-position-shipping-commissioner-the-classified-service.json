    "critique": "The document is a short executive order about the position of Shipping Commissioner. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary goal seems to be efficiency and standardization in hiring for this position. There's no explicit emotional appeal. However, one could argue that placing the position in the competitive classified service aims to reduce corruption and increase fairness, which might elicit a small amount of joy or relief. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
