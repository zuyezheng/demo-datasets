    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration designating Afghanistan as a combat zone. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of resolve and determination in the face of conflict. There might be an element of sadness due to the situation, but the overall tone is one of decisive action. Surprise is unlikely, as this follows from prior events. Disgust and fear are not the primary emotions being conveyed by this document itself, though they may be related to the context.",
