    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a departmental rule regarding exceptions from examination in the Department of Agriculture. The primary goal is to ensure that scientific or professional experts can be employed for investigations authorized by Congress. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The language is precise and legalistic. The context is internal departmental procedure.The president likely wants to convey a sense of order, efficiency, and adherence to the law. There is no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not directly relevant. A low score is appropriate for each.",
