    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding economic stabilization during wartime. The language is formal and legalistic. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage the economy during a difficult time. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The goal is to maintain the status quo and ensure the effective administration of wage and price controls. Therefore, most scores should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional content.",
