    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a customs rule, adding a specific exemption for a chief clerk and law clerk at the port of New York. As the President, the primary goal is efficient administration, not necessarily eliciting strong emotions. The tone is neutral and factual. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this lack of emotional intent. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust would all be very low. Surprise might be slightly higher, as any change could elicit a small amount of surprise, but still relatively low. Revised scores will reflect the neutral tone and administrative nature of the document.",
