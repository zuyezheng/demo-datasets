    "critique": "The document is a simple announcement of Ulysses S. Grant's death and an order to close government offices. As the President, I primarily aim to convey respect and a sense of mourning. There's sadness due to the death, but also a sense of duty and respect for the former President. There isn't a strong element of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is sadness, followed by respect which can be interpreted as a low level of joy for his service, and the other emotions are negligible.",
