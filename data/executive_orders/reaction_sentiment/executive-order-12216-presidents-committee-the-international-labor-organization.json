    "critique": "The document establishes a committee to monitor and assess the work of the ILO. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to manage international labor relations. There's a slight element of surprise that such a committee is being formed, but overall, the emotions are muted. The initial scores reflect this: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. After further consideration, I think the surprise is a bit too high. The document is fairly routine, so I'll reduce the surprise score. Also, there might be a slight sense of joy that the government is taking action, so I'll increase that slightly. The revised scores are: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
