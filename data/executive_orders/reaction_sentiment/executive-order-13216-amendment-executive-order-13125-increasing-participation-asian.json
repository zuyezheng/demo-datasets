    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of positive change and opportunity for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The language is formal and authoritative, reflecting the President's role. The emotions I want to elicit are primarily joy and a sense of hope. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the change in title and extension of the commission, but it's not a dominant emotion. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
