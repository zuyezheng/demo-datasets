    "critique": "The document outlines the establishment of an Interdepartmental Committee on Scientific Research and Development. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (through the promotion of national welfare and increased efficiency), and surprise (through the innovative steps and changes in policies). There might be a little fear and disgust from those who don't want to change the way of doing things, but I want to keep that low. There is no sadness or anger intended. The initial scores reflect these considerations. Upon review, I think the initial scores are a good representation of the emotions conveyed.",
