    "critique": "The document focuses on transferring functions and amending previous orders related to equal employment opportunity. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from those who benefit from these policies, such as minorities, women, and people with disabilities. There might also be a sense of surprise at the extent of the changes and a reduction in fear and disgust related to discrimination. Sadness and anger are less relevant in this context, although some who oppose these policies might feel those emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
