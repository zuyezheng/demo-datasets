    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order, primarily dealing with legal and administrative technicalities. The tone is formal and legalistic. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are minimal. There's no call for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims for efficient internal management and doesn't seek to evoke strong emotional responses from the public. Therefore, initial scores should be low across all emotions. Revised scores will reflect this understanding.",
