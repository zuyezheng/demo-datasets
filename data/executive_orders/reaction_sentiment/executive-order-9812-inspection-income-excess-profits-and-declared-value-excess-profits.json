    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax returns and inspection by a House committee. The tone is official and procedural. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to trust in government and confidence in oversight, but not strongly. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the nature of the document.",
