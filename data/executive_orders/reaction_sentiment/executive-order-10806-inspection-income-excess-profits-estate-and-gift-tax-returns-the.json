    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections by a Senate committee. The tone is official and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence in the government's operations and commitment to efficiency. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild element if the public wasn't expecting such scrutiny, but it's minimal. Therefore, most scores should be low, reflecting the neutral and procedural nature of the order.",
