    "critique": "The document is a formal order to fly the flag at half-staff in memory of Ambassador Davies. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is sadness and respect. There might be a sense of surprise at the sudden death, but it's not the main focus. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the highest. The revised scores slightly adjust the surprise level based on the context of a sudden death.",
