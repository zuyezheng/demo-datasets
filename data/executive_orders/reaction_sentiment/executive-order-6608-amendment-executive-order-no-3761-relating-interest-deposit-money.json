    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding interest rates on deposit money orders in the Canal Zone. As the author, the President, the primary emotions to elicit are likely related to stability, trust, and perhaps a sense of fairness or satisfaction that the financial matters are being handled appropriately. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. Joy is unlikely to be a primary emotion, as it's a financial regulation. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are also unlikely to be strong emotions elicited by this order. Surprise might be a mild emotion if people were not expecting this change, but it's probably minimal. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
