    "critique": "The document is an executive order that reconstitutes the National Industrial Recovery Board. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to manage the economy and address industrial recovery. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so I will have to infer them from the context and tone. Joy might be present in the sense of hope for economic improvement, but it's not a strong emotion conveyed. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order seems to be a routine administrative action.",
