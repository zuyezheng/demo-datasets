    "critique": "The document aims to bring closure to a contentious period in American history by pardoning those who violated the Selective Service Act. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from those who are pardoned and their families. There might be some sadness from those who feel that justice has not been served. There could be anger from those who disagree with the pardon. Fear and disgust are less likely to be elicited, but there might be some surprise at the extent of the pardon.",
