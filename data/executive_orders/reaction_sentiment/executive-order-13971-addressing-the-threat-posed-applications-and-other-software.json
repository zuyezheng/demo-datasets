    "critique": "The document expresses concern about national security and the protection of Americans' data. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are fear (of data breaches and foreign influence) and a sense of security (through the actions taken). There's also an element of anger towards the PRC and CCP for their alleged activities. Surprise is less relevant, as the document presents this as a known and ongoing issue. Disgust is present, but not as strongly as fear or security. Joy is not an emotion the President is trying to elicit.",
