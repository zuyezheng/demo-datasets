    "critique": "The document establishes the National Resources Board and outlines its functions, primarily focusing on planning and development of national resources. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (through the promise of progress and development), and a sense of surprise that the government is taking action. There might be a tinge of sadness from the abolishment of previous boards, but overall, the tone is positive and forward-looking. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to inspire confidence and optimism.",
