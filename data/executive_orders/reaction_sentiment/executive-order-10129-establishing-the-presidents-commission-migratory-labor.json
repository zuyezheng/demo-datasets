    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on addressing migratory labor issues. The language is formal and aims to address problems, suggesting a focus on sadness and perhaps some fear or disgust related to the issues being addressed. The surprise score is low as the document outlines a planned course of action. However, the initial scores could be refined to better reflect the nuances of the document. The revised scores aim to capture these nuances more accurately.",
