The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through national security and interest), and perhaps a reduction in fear (by addressing potential labor problems). There might be a slight element of surprise at the establishment of the Missile Sites Labor Commission. There's no indication of anger, disgust, or sadness being intentionally conveyed. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
