The primary goal seems to be efficiency and mutual benefit for the state and the Post Office Department. There's no strong emotional appeal intended. The waiver is presented as a practical solution, recommended by the Postmaster General and concurred with by the Civil Service Commission. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
