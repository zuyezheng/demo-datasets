    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding allowances for Foreign Service officers. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal is to communicate a change in regulations, not to elicit strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of satisfaction (joy) for streamlining processes, but it's minimal. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
