The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of security (reducing fear) and confidence in the government's ability to manage the situation. There might be some sadness due to the war, but the focus is on national security. Surprise is not a major factor. Disgust and anger are not emotions the President wants to elicit from the population.",
