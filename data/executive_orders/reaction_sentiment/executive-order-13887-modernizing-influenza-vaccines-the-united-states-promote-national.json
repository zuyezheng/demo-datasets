    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on addressing a serious public health threat and outlining a plan of action. However, I might have underestimated the element of 'surprise' given the potential for a sudden pandemic, and perhaps slightly overestimated 'sadness' which is more of a consequence than a directly elicited emotion. I will adjust the scores accordingly.",
