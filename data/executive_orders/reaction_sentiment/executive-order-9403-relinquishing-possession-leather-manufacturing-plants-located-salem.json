    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of resolution and restoration. The President aims to evoke joy that productive efficiency has been restored, and sadness that the government had to take control of the plants in the first place, but also a sense of relief that it is now over. There is a hint of fear that the government might need to retain some control, and a bit of surprise that the situation has been resolved so quickly. Disgust and anger are not really conveyed in the document.",
