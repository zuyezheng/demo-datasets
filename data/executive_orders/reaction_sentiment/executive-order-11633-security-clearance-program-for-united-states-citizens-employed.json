    "critique": "The document aims to reassure and inspire confidence while addressing a potential security concern. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (related to security and national interest), and perhaps a touch of surprise that such measures are being taken. Fear and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions, but a small amount of sadness might be present due to the necessary restrictions on individual freedom. The initial scores reflect this assessment, but the revised scores adjust the intensity based on a more careful reading of the text and its implications.",
