    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land use in Arizona. As the author, the President, I want to convey a sense of fairness and opportunity, especially for ex-service men. The tone is formal and legalistic, so strong emotions are unlikely. Joy might be present in the sense of providing opportunities, but it's not a dominant emotion. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be conveyed. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order seems procedural.",
