    "critique": "The document focuses on preventing epidemic diseases through quarantine measures. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of safety and security (low fear), and confidence in the government's ability to handle the situation (moderate joy). There might be some surprise at the extent of the measures, but overall, I want to minimize negative emotions like sadness, disgust, and anger. The initial scores reflect this, but I think I can refine them further after a more careful review.",
