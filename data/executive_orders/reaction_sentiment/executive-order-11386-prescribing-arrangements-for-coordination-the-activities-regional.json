    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on coordinating federal efforts for regional economic development. The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are likely joy (through improved economic conditions) and a sense of security/reduced fear (through addressing unemployment and underemployment). There might be a slight element of surprise due to the restructuring of committees and responsibilities. Sadness, anger, and disgust are unlikely to be primary emotions elicited by this document.",
