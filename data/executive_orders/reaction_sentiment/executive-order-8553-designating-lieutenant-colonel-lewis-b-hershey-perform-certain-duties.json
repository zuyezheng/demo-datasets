    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the administration of the Selective Service law. The tone is authoritative and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and compliance, not strong emotions like joy or sadness. Fear and surprise are unlikely to be intended. Disgust is not relevant. The most relevant emotions are a mild sense of confidence and perhaps a lack of surprise that the government is taking action.",
