    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of decisive action and a return to policies that serve the public interest. The revocation of the previous executive orders suggests a desire to elicit joy from those who benefit from the change, and perhaps surprise at the swiftness of the action. There might be some sadness or anger from those who supported the previous orders, but the overall tone is intended to be positive and reassuring. The intensity of each emotion is scored based on this interpretation.",
