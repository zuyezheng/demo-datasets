    "critique": "The document expresses a mix of emotions. The acceptance of McClellan's resignation might elicit sadness or relief depending on one's perspective, but the tone is neutral. The commendation of Sheridan is clearly intended to inspire joy and confidence. There's no explicit anger, fear, or disgust expressed. Surprise is possible given the rapid promotion, but not strongly emphasized. The initial scores reflect these observations. The revised scores slightly adjust the emphasis based on a closer reading, increasing joy and surprise while slightly decreasing sadness.",
