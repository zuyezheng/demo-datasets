The primary goal is to efficiently delegate responsibilities and ensure smooth operation of existing laws related to foreign assistance and agricultural trade. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and compliance rather than emotional impact. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. However, a slight sense of joy might be intended for those who benefit from these programs, and a slight sense of surprise might be intended due to the scope of the order.",
