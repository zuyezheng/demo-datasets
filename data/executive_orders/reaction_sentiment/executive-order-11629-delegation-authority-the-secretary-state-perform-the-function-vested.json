    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of State regarding migratory bird protection. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The actions are administrative and not designed to evoke strong emotional responses. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
