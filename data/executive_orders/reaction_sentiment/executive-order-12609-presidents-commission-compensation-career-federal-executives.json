    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, extending the deadline for a commission's work. As such, it's unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary goal is likely to be a sense of quiet competence and orderly governance. There's no indication of intended joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. A slight sense of 'surprise' might be intended, as the extension could be unexpected, but it's minimal.",
