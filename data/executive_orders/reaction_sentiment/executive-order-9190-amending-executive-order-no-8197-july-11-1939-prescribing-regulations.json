    "critique": "The document is an executive order detailing the process for assigning US government employees to foreign governments. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is confidence in the process and assurance that it is being handled responsibly. There is a sense of control and order conveyed through the detailed regulations. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order seems to be about establishing a predictable procedure.",
