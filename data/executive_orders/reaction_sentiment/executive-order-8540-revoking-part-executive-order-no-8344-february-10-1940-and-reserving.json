    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land in Alaska. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources and infrastructure. The order itself is quite technical and specific, so strong emotions are unlikely. However, there might be a slight sense of joy for those who benefit from the air-navigation site and perhaps a touch of disappointment (sadness) for those who might have hoped to settle, locate, sell, or enter the land. Fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be significant emotions elicited by this document.",
