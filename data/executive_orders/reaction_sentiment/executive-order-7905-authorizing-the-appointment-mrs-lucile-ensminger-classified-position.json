    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Lucile Ensminger to a classified position in the Navy Department. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for Mrs. Ensminger and perhaps a sense of justice or gratitude. There might also be an element of sadness due to the circumstances of her husband's death. There is no anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. Surprise is possible, but not explicitly stated. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
