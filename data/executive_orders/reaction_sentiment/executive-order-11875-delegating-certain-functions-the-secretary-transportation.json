    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding an investigation into war risk insurance. The tone is official and procedural. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is taking necessary steps to address potential risks. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be relatively low, with a slight emphasis on confidence-related emotions like joy and surprise that the government is taking action.",
