    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. The document is primarily a legal order, so strong emotions are unlikely. Joy and surprise are probably the lowest, while a touch of sadness (loss of land use for some) and fear/disgust (related to penalties for violations) might be slightly higher. I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
