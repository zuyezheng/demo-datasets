    "critique": "The document is a financial transaction related to the Federal Emergency Relief Act. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy that funds are being allocated to help people during the depression. There might be some sadness that such measures are necessary, but overall the tone is one of action and relief. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Initial scores: joy: 6, sadness: 3, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is very dry and formal. While the action itself is positive, the document itself doesn't convey much emotion. I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
