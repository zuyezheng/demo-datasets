The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage the economy. There is a slight sense of joy that the code has been approved and that the industry will be regulated fairly. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the code was approved so quickly.",
