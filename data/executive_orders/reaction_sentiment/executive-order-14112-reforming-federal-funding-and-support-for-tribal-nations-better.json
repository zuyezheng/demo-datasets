    "critique": "The document aims to evoke joy and trust by addressing past injustices and promising a better future for Tribal Nations. It also seeks to reduce fear and frustration by streamlining bureaucratic processes and increasing Tribal autonomy. There's an element of surprise in the commitment to new levels of support and flexibility. Disgust and sadness are present as emotions related to the past policies, but the document focuses on moving forward. The initial scores reflect these intentions, but the revised scores adjust the intensity based on a more careful reading of the text.",
