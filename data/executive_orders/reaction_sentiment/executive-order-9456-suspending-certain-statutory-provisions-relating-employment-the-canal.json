    "critique": "The document is a legal order related to employment in the Canal Zone during wartime. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability during a time of war. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be relatively low. The order aims to maintain essential functions, so there might be a slight sense of joy or relief that things are continuing. There might be a slight sense of fear or concern due to the ongoing wars. There is no indication of anger, disgust, or surprise.",
