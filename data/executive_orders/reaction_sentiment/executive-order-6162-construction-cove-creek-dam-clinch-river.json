    "critique": "The document expresses the President's decision to place the construction of the Cove Creek Dam under the direction of Arthur E. Morgan. The tone is formal and decisive. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the project is in capable hands. There is a hint of joy that the project is moving forward. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that Arthur E. Morgan is doing this without additional compensation.",
