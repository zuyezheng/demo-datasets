As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence in the government's ability to manage resources effectively. There is a slight element of fear that the resources could be exploited if not protected. There is no explicit joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise conveyed or intended.\n\nInitial scores:\nJoy: 1\nSadness: 1\nAnger: 1\nFear: 3\nDisgust: 1\nSurprise: 1\n\nRevised scores:\nJoy: 1\nSadness: 1\nAnger: 1\nFear: 3\nDisgust: 1\nSurprise: 1",
