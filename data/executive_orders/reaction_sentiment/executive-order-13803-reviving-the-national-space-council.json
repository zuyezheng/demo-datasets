    "critique": "The document aims to revive the National Space Council and coordinate national space policy. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (excitement about space exploration), surprise (at the renewed focus on space), and perhaps a touch of reduced fear (through coordinated national security). There's little to suggest sadness, anger, or disgust. The language is formal and focused on coordination and policy, not strong emotional appeals. The initial scores reflect this, but I'll revise them to better capture the intended positive emotions and minimize the negative ones.",
