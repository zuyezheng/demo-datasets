    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating responsibilities related to immigration reform. The tone is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional appeals. As the President, the primary goal is efficient execution of the law. The document itself doesn't aim to elicit strong emotions, but rather to ensure the smooth functioning of government processes. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a neutral emotional tone.",
