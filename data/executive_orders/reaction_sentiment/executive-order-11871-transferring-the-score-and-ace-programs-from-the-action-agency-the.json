The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy and surprise, as the order aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
