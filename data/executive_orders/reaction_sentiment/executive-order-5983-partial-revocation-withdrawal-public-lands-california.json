    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding islands, rocks, and pinnacles in the Pacific Ocean. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief or perhaps mild satisfaction that an outdated order is being corrected. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. The tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust should be low. Surprise might be slightly higher if the revocation was unexpected, but overall, the scores should be low.",
