The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (in preserving history), and perhaps a mild sense of surprise or interest in the historical details provided. There's also an underlying sense of reassurance and safety due to the fireproof construction of the Library of Congress. There's no indication of anger, disgust, or significant sadness.",
