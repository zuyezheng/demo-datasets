    "critique": "The document describes the approval of an official seal for the Panama Canal Commission. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of pride and perhaps a bit of surprise at the detail involved in the seal's design. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
