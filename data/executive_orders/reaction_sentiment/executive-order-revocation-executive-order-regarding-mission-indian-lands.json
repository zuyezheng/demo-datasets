    "critique": "The document cancels part of a previous order regarding land for Mission Indians. As the President, I would anticipate this action might elicit sadness and anger from those affected, and perhaps surprise from others. There's likely little joy, fear, or disgust associated with this specific action. The intensity of sadness and anger would depend on the impact on the Mission Indians, but given the limited scope, it's probably moderate. Surprise might be low as such orders are not uncommon. I will revise the scores to reflect these considerations.",
