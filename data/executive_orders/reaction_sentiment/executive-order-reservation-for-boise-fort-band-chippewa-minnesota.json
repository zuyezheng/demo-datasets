    "critique": "The document is a legal order related to land allocation for the Boise Fort Band of Chippewa Indians. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of joy and satisfaction that justice is being served and that the treaty obligations are being met. I also want to convey a sense of respect for the law and the rights of the indigenous people. There might be a slight element of surprise that such an action is being taken, but overall, the goal is to create a sense of positive resolution. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression, but the underlying intent is to create a positive outcome.",
