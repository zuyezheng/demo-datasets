    "critique": "The document aims to reassure and provide opportunities for employees of the United States Railroad Administration. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, by ensuring job security and offering a path to continued service. There's also an element of reducing fear and sadness by preventing job loss. Surprise and disgust are less relevant here. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores fine-tune the emphasis on joy and reduced fear.",
