    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the civil service status of employees of the Office of Indian Affairs. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and fairness, but the language is not emotionally charged. The actions are related to internal processes and are unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are likely to be low across all emotions. Revised scores will reflect a slightly higher sense of order and fairness, but still relatively low overall.",
