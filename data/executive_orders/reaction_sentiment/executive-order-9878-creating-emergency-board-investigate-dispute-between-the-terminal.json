    "critique": "The document describes the creation of a board to investigate a dispute between a railroad company and its employees. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming to convey a sense of order and authority. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of calm and reassurance that the situation is being handled responsibly. There's a desire to minimize fear and anxiety related to potential disruptions in transportation services. There is also an element of surprise in that the President is taking action. The language is neutral, focusing on the facts of the dispute and the legal framework for resolving it. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, and disgust are not relevant in this context. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
