    "critique": "The document is an executive order imposing sanctions on Iran. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are fear and disgust from the Iranian government and those who support their actions, and a sense of joy and security from the American people and those who value human rights. The tone is formal and authoritative, which aims to convey seriousness and determination. The language is legalistic and precise, leaving little room for misinterpretation. The context is a national emergency related to Iran's actions. I will score the emotions accordingly, then critique and revise.",
