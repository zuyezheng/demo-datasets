It also acknowledges the sadness and potential fear/anxiety veterans might face during the transition. There's a subtle element of addressing potential disgust or frustration related to the lack of opportunities previously. Surprise is less relevant here. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores fine-tune the intensity based on a closer reading.",
