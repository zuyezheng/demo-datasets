    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the registry of vessels purchased by US citizens. The tone is purely administrative and legal. There is no explicit or implicit emotional appeal. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low, as the document's purpose is purely procedural and not intended to evoke any particular emotional response. The initial scores should reflect this neutrality.",
