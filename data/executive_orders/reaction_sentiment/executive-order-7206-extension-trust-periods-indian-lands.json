As the President, I aim to evoke joy and reduce fear among the Native American population by ensuring continued protection of their lands. I also want to convey a sense of stability and reliability. The order is carefully worded to avoid overreach, acknowledging Congressional authority, which should minimize anger or disgust from other political actors. Surprise is not a primary emotion I'm trying to elicit.",
