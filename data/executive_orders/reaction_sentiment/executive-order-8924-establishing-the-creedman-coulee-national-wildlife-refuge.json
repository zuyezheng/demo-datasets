    "critique": "The document describes the creation of a wildlife refuge. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for conservation), and perhaps a little surprise that such an action is being taken. There might be a little sadness for those who can no longer use the land for other purposes, and perhaps some disgust and fear from those who are against the protection of wildlife. The tone is formal and decisive, suggesting a moderate level of conviction.",
