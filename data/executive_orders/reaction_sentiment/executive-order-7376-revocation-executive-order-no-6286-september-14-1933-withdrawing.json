    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low across the board, with a slight emphasis on order and perhaps a bit of surprise that the resurvey is complete.",
