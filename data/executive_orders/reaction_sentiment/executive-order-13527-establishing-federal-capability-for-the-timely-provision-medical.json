The document aims to inspire confidence and preparedness, but also acknowledges the potential for a biological attack, leading to a mix of emotions. The revised scores slightly adjust the emphasis based on a more careful reading, particularly increasing the 'fear' score to reflect the underlying threat that necessitates these measures.",
