    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding allowances and differentials for US employees in foreign areas and cost of living allowances in certain nonforeign areas. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in the administration of these allowances. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as these are routine administrative matters.",
