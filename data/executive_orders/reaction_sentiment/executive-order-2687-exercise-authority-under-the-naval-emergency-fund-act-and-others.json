    "critique": "The document is a delegation of power from the President to the Secretary of the Navy regarding naval construction and procurement during World War I. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security, but also perhaps a bit of surprise at the speed and efficiency with which the Navy will now be able to operate. There isn't much explicit emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 4. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 4",
