    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order transferring authority over the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation to the Secretary of Defense. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security, perhaps tinged with a bit of surprise at the action. There's no explicit mention of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
