The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for those who receive the medal and perhaps a sense of pride and gratitude from the nation. There might be a slight element of surprise for those who are not expecting the award. There isn't a strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust in this context. The initial scores reflect this assessment.\n\nRevised scores:\nJoy: Increased to 8 to reflect the positive nature of the award.\nSurprise: Reduced to 3 as the award is formally established, reducing the element of surprise.\nOther emotions remain low.",
