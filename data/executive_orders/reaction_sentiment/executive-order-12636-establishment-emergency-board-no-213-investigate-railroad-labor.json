    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate a dispute. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of calm and order, and to show that the situation is being handled responsibly. The language is formal and legalistic, which contributes to this sense of control. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a factor, as the order is a measured response to a known issue. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
