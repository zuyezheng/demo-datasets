    "critique": "The document is a short statement regarding the appointment of Kenneth C. Macpherson. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality.",
