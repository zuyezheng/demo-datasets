The document aims to instill a sense of security and control, while also acknowledging the importance of the internet for commerce and free speech. The initial assessment might be too optimistic about the joy and too low on the fear and disgust related to the unlawful activities. The revised scores reflect a more balanced view of the intended emotional impact.",
