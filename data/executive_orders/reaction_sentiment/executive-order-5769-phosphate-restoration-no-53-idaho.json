    "critique": "The document is a revocation of previous executive orders related to phosphate reserves. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief or perhaps mild satisfaction that outdated orders are being removed. There isn't a strong emotional component to this action. The tone is administrative and factual, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust would be low. Surprise might be slightly higher as revocations can sometimes be unexpected, but overall, the emotional intensity is minimal.",
