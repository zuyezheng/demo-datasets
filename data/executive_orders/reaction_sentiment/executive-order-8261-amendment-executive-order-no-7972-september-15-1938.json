    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding financial compensation for US personnel serving abroad. The language is formal and bureaucratic. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and fairness, but the document itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The actions are to ensure proper compensation, so I would expect a small amount of joy from those affected, and perhaps a reduction in fear or sadness related to financial insecurity. There's nothing inherently angering, disgusting, or surprising about the content.",
