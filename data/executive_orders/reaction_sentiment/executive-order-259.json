    "critique": "The document expresses respect and remembrance for President Garfield. It aims to facilitate attendance at memorial events. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (in honoring Garfield), sadness (at his passing), and perhaps a touch of surprise (at the scale of the commemoration). Fear, disgust, and anger are unlikely to be intended emotions. The initial scores reflect these assumptions. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity based on a more careful reading, emphasizing the somber nature of the event.",
