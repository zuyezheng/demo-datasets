As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security that the military has what it needs. The tone is formal and authoritative. There is not enough information to assess emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise, so I will start with a score of 1 for each.",
