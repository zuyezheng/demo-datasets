It also seeks to inspire a sense of national pride and recognition for those contributing to export growth. The language is formal and authoritative, reflecting the President's role and the importance of the initiative. The document does not explicitly express negative emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a primary focus, as the program is presented as a deliberate and planned effort.",
