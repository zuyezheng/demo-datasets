    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding the operation of piers at the Panama Canal. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and efficient governance. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a focus on procedure and order. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The actions are administrative and unlikely to generate intense feelings. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think a slight sense of reassurance or confidence might be intended, so I will adjust joy to 2. The other emotions remain very low.",
