    "critique": "The document is a succession order within the Department of Interior. It outlines who takes over the Secretary's duties in case of death, resignation, absence, or sickness. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal is to ensure a smooth transition of power and maintain the continuity of government operations. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The emotions I want to elicit are low across the board. There might be a slight sense of reassurance (low joy) that things are taken care of, and perhaps a tiny bit of surprise that such a detailed order is necessary. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
