    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of authority to the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the TIR Convention. The tone is formal and legalistic. There's no explicit emotional appeal. As President, I'm aiming for a sense of confidence and order, but the document itself doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. The primary emotions I want to elicit are confidence and perhaps a mild sense of reassurance that international agreements are being handled properly. However, the text is very dry and procedural, so the actual emotional impact is likely minimal. Therefore, most scores will be low.",
