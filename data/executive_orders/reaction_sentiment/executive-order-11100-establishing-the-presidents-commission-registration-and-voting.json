The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of hope and confidence in the government's ability to address the issue. There might be some sadness regarding the current state of voter participation, but the overall tone is optimistic and proactive. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not a primary emotion.",
