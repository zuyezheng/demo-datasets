It also acknowledges sadness due to the humanitarian crisis and suffering caused by previous policies. There's an element of anger directed at those who exploit the system, like drug cartels and human traffickers. Fear is present due to the need for border security and addressing violence. Disgust is aimed at corruption and human rights abuses. Surprise is less prominent, but could be associated with the changes being implemented.",
