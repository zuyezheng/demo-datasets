    "critique": "The document describes the establishment of reservations for Mission Indians in California. As the President, I aim to convey a sense of hope and security for the Indians, but also resolve in establishing these reservations. The primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for the Indians receiving land), and perhaps a bit of surprise and hope that the government is acting in their interest. There might be some sadness associated with the history that led to this point, but overall, the tone is one of positive action. Disgust, fear, and anger are not really relevant in this context, so they should be scored low.",
