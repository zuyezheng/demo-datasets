    "critique": "The document outlines regulations for the construction of jetties at the mouth of the Mississippi River. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of order, security, and perhaps a bit of surprise at the efficiency. There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming for clarity and compliance. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for negative emotions and a moderate score for surprise due to the detailed nature of the regulations. Upon review, the surprise element might be overstated. The document is more about establishing clear rules than causing astonishment. Therefore, the revised surprise score is lowered.",
