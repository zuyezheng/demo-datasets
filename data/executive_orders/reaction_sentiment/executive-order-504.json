    "critique": "The document is very short and formal. As such, it is difficult to determine the emotions the President wants to elicit. The primary emotion seems to be a sense of order and control. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are all set to 1, indicating a neutral emotional tone. Upon further reflection, the approval of recommendations and the instruction to the Secretary of the Interior suggest a desire for a sense of order and perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction or control. Therefore, I will adjust the joy score to 2 to reflect this subtle emotion.",
