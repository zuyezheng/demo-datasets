    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to project stability and control. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions, but rather to convey a sense of duty and resolution. Therefore, I would expect low scores for most emotions, with perhaps a slightly higher score for surprise that the President is involved.",
