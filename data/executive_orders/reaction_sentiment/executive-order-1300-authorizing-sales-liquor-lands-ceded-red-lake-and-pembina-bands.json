    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on a legal and territorial matter, specifically modifying the application of a treaty. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional appeal. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely minimal. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise might be a slight factor if the order alters previous expectations, but overall, the emotional impact is low.Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.Revised scores: Upon further reflection, the document is purely administrative. There is no intention to elicit any emotions. Therefore, all scores should be 1.",
