    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the communication of restricted data related to atomic energy. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are trust, confidence, and a sense of security. However, the document itself is very technical and procedural, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions directly. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming for clarity and compliance rather than emotional impact. Therefore, the initial scores will be relatively low across the board. I will revise the scores to reflect the intended emotions, even if they are not explicitly stated in the text. The document is more about establishing a process and less about eliciting a specific emotional response.",
