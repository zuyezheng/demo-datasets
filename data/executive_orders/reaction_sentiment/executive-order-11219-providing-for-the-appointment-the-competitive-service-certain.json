    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of Foreign Service officers or employees to positions in the competitive service. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance in the fairness and efficiency of the civil service system. There is a slight element of joy in providing opportunities for qualified individuals, but it's not a dominant emotion. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight element of surprise for those who were not aware of this possibility, but it's minimal.",
