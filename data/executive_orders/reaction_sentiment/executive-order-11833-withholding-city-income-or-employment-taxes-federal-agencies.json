    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the withholding of city income or employment taxes from the compensation of federal employees. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of order, compliance, and perhaps a bit of relief that this process is being formalized and standardized. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document, as it's largely administrative. Therefore, most emotions will be relatively low in intensity. I will start with initial scores and then revise them after a more careful consideration.",
