    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of Peres D. Ziegler as a rural letter carrier. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that a former member of the U.S.S. Panay crew, injured in the line of duty, is being appointed to a position in the Postal Service. There may also be an element of sadness related to the bombing and sinking of the vessel and the injuries sustained by Mr. Ziegler. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
