    "critique": "The document extends a restriction on land alienation for Native Americans. As the President, I would want to elicit a sense of security and perhaps mild gratitude from the Native American population, and a sense of stability and order from the general public. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores should be relatively low. Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon review, the extension likely wouldn't elicit strong joy, but perhaps a sense of relief. The sadness score might be a bit high, as it's more about preventing something negative than causing sadness. Fear is possible, as the extension addresses a potential loss. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1",
