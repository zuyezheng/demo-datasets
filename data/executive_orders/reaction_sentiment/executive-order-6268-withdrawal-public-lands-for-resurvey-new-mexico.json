    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to the law. There's not much room for strong emotions here. The tone is formal and authoritative. I'll start with low scores across the board and then adjust based on the context. Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon review, perhaps a slight sense of reassurance or confidence (a little joy) that the government is functioning properly. No real sadness, anger, fear, or disgust seems appropriate. Surprise is unlikely.",
