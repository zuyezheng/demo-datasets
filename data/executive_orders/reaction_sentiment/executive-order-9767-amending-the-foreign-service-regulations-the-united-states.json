    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending fees related to repatriation and oaths of allegiance. As the author, the President, the primary emotions to elicit are likely related to reassurance, stability, and fairness. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely given the nature of the document. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
