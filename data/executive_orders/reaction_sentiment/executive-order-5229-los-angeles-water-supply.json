    "critique": "The document is a legal order withdrawing land from settlement to protect Los Angeles' water supply. As the author, the President, I want to convey a sense of assurance and confidence in the action. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of security (related to water supply) and perhaps a mild surprise at the extent of the withdrawal. There's no intention to cause sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming for a neutral tone.",
