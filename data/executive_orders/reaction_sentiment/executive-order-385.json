Anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are possible, but should be relatively low. The tone is formal and direct, suggesting a focus on duty and obedience rather than strong emotional responses. Initial scores: joy=1, sadness=1, anger=3, fear=3, disgust=2, surprise=2. Revised scores: joy=1, sadness=1, anger=2, fear=2, disgust=1, surprise=1.",
