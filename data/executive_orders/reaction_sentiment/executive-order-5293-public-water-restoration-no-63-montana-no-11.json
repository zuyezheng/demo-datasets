    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous order and restoration of land to the public domain. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps mild surprise that land is being made available. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for surprise. The critique suggests that the surprise score might be a bit high, and perhaps a touch of satisfaction (joy) could be present, so the revised scores are adjusted accordingly.",
