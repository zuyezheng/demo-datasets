    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding pay scales for various government employees. The tone is very neutral and factual. As such, it's unlikely the president is trying to elicit strong emotions. The primary goal is to ensure fair and consistent pay, which might bring a sense of stability and perhaps mild satisfaction to those affected. However, there's no explicit attempt to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
