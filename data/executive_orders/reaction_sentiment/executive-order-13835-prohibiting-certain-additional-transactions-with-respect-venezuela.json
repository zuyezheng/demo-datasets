    "critique": "The document expresses concern over the economic mismanagement, corruption, and repression in Venezuela. The President aims to convey a sense of resolve and determination to address the situation. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a mix of concern (sadness), resolve (joy/hope for the future), and perhaps a degree of anger towards the Maduro regime. There might also be an element of surprise at the extent of the crisis, but this is less prominent. Disgust at the corruption is also likely. Fear is not a primary emotion being conveyed.",
