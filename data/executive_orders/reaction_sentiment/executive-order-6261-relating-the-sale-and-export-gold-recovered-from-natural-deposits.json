    "critique": "The document conveys a sense of decisive action during a national emergency. The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are likely a sense of confidence and stability. Joy might be a secondary emotion, stemming from the hope that these measures will improve the economic situation. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are less prominent, as the focus is on taking control and providing solutions. Surprise is also minimal, as the order is a response to an existing emergency. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy slightly elevated due to the hopeful nature of the order. The revised scores adjust the emotions to better reflect the document.",
