    "critique": "The document focuses on promoting physical fitness and sports through a national program. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through participation in sports), and perhaps a reduction in sadness and fear related to health concerns. There might be a slight element of surprise at the comprehensive nature of the program. Disgust and anger are unlikely to be relevant here. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
