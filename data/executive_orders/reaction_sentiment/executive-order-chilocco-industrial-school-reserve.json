    "critique": "The document is an executive order that withdraws land from sale and settlement and sets it apart for the use of the Pima and Maricopa Indians. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the Pima and Maricopa Indians, and perhaps a sense of security and hope. There might be some sadness or anger from those who were planning to settle or purchase the land, but the order aims to benefit the Native American tribes. There isn't much surprise, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document.",
