    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of decisive action and resolve in ensuring the continued production of war materials. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security that the war effort will not be hampered by labor disputes. There is also an element of fear directed towards those who might disrupt the war effort. There is little to no joy, sadness, or disgust conveyed in the document. Surprise is also minimal, as the actions are presented as a necessary response to a known problem.",
