    "critique": "The document discusses a pay increase for enlisted men in the Navy based on good conduct. As the President, I would want to elicit joy and perhaps some surprise (a pleasant one) from the Navy personnel. There might be a little sadness from those who don't qualify, but overall, the goal is positive. Disgust, fear, and anger are unlikely to be primary emotions elicited by this policy. Initial scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 4. Upon further reflection, the surprise might be a bit higher as it's a direct financial benefit. Also, the joy might be slightly less intense, as it's a relatively small amount of money. Revised scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 5.",
