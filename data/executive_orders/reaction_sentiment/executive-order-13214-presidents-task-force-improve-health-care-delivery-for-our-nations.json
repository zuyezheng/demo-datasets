    "critique": "The document aims to improve healthcare for veterans. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (through improved healthcare) and perhaps a sense of surprise that the government is taking action. There might be a slight element of reducing fear by addressing healthcare concerns. There's little to suggest sadness, disgust, or anger being conveyed. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust the joy score upwards to reflect the positive intent of the order.",
