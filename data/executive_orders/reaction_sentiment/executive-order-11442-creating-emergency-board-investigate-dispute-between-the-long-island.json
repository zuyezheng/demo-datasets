    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The tone is neutral and legalistic, aiming to resolve a potential disruption to interstate commerce. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly and fairly. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild element, as the creation of a board might be unexpected by some, but it's not a primary goal. The initial scores reflect this: low across the board, with a slight bump for surprise. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, but I'll slightly adjust the surprise score to reflect the potential for a mild, positive surprise that action is being taken.",
