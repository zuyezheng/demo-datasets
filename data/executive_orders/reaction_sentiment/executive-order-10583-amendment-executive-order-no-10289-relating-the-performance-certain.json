    "critique": "The document is a technical amendment to an existing executive order. It deals with the transfer of authority regarding taxes and regulations in the Canal Zone and the approval of regulations related to postage stamps. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is little to suggest strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction that the government is functioning efficiently. The document does not seem to elicit strong emotions.",
