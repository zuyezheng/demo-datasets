    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal in Montana. The tone is formal and factual. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely minimal. There's no explicit attempt to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is simply a procedural action. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Revised scores will reflect the same, as the critique confirms the initial assessment.",
