    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order, extending the deadline for the National Commission on Superconductivity to complete its report and disband. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are minimal. There is no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The actions are administrative and technical in nature. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a neutral or very low emotional intensity across all categories. The critique is that the initial scores are too high and should be adjusted to reflect the neutral tone and administrative nature of the document.",
