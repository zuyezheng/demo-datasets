    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing a merit-based system for attorney positions within the civil service. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are trust in the government's competence and fairness. There's also an element of reassurance, especially given the context of wartime appointments. The language is formal and procedural, suggesting a desire for order and efficiency rather than strong emotional responses. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are all relatively low. The initial scores reflect this, with slight emphasis on trust and reassurance. The revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the subtle nuances of the document's intended emotional impact.",
