The primary goal is efficiency and clarity in designating a customs port of entry. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of satisfaction (joy) from streamlining operations, but it's minimal. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the order.",
