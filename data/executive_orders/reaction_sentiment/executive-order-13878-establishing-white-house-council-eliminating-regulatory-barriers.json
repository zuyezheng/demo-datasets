    "critique": "The document aims to address the issue of affordable housing by reducing regulatory barriers. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, by improving the quality of life for Americans and providing more economic opportunities. There is also an element of hope and optimism. The document also acknowledges the sadness and frustration caused by the current housing situation. There is a sense of urgency and determination to address the problem. Surprise is not a major factor, as the issues are well-known. Disgust is present due to the regulatory barriers. Fear is present due to the economic impact of the housing crisis.",
