    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing a merit system and ensuring fair treatment of employees in the Canal Zone, irrespective of their nationality. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through fair treatment and opportunities) and a reduction in fear and disgust (by addressing potential discrimination). There might be a slight element of surprise due to the changes being implemented. Sadness and anger are less relevant in this context, as the document aims to create a more equitable environment.",
