    "critique": "The document aims to instill confidence and hope by addressing the economic crisis. The creation of the Second Export-Import Bank of Washington, D.C. is presented as a solution to unemployment and disorganization of industry. The tone is formal and authoritative, reflecting the President's commitment to resolving the national emergency. The document seeks to convey a sense of control and proactive action. The initial scores reflect the primary emotions the President wants to elicit: Joy (hope for economic recovery), Surprise (a new initiative), and a reduction of Fear (of economic collapse) and Sadness (due to unemployment). Disgust and Anger are not primary emotions the document intends to evoke. The revised scores take into account the subtle nuances of the document's language and context, adjusting the intensity of each emotion accordingly.",
