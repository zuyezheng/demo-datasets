    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a reservation for the Yuma and other Indians. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are likely a mix of positive and neutral emotions. I want the Yuma and other Indians to feel joy and relief that they have a designated reservation. I also want the general public to feel a sense of justice and fairness. However, there might be some sadness among those who are displaced or whose settlement and sale are withdrawn. There might be some surprise for those who were not expecting this decision. There is not enough information to suggest anger, fear, or disgust. Initial scores: joy: 7, sadness: 3, surprise: 4, fear: 1, disgust: 1. Revised scores: joy: 6, sadness: 3, surprise: 3, fear: 1, disgust: 1.",
