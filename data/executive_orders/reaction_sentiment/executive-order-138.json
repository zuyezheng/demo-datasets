    "critique": "The document is a directive regarding the evacuation of Havana. As the President, my primary goal is to ensure a smooth and orderly transition. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming for a sense of control and stability. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions, but a subtle sense of relief and perhaps cautious optimism might be present. Joy is low as it's a formal process, sadness is low as it's an evacuation, anger is low as it's a directive, fear is low as it's a planned event, disgust is low as it's a procedural matter, and surprise is low as it's an expected event.",
