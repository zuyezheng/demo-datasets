    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a departmental rule, adding an exception for one artist in the Department of Agriculture. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably a mild sense of satisfaction or perhaps even indifference. There's no strong emotional content here. The tone is administrative and factual. Therefore, I would score joy, surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness as low, and perhaps a slightly higher score for joy, as the creation of an artist position could be seen as a positive thing.",
