    "critique": "The document is an executive order creating a Board of Inquiry to address labor disputes in the maritime industry. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey stability and control. Joy is not a relevant emotion in this context. Sadness might be present due to the potential negative impact of the labor disputes, but it's not a primary focus. Anger is not intended, but some parties involved in the disputes might feel it. Fear is a possible emotion among those who rely on the maritime industry, but the order aims to alleviate it. Disgust is unlikely to be a significant emotion. Surprise is also not a primary emotion, as the order is a response to an existing situation. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 4, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
