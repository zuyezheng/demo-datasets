As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief or perhaps mild satisfaction that an outdated restriction has been removed. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. Joy would be low, as it's a technical correction. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise might be slightly higher than the others, but still low.",
