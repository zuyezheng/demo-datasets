    "critique": "The document is a dry, legalistic order regarding tax return inspections. As the President, I'm not trying to elicit strong emotions, but rather ensure compliance and facilitate statistical analysis for the Department of Commerce. There's no language suggesting joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is efficient governance, not emotional manipulation. Therefore, most scores should be low, reflecting the neutral tone.",
