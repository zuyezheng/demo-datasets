    "critique": "The document focuses on combating trafficking in persons, a form of modern slavery. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of joy that action is being taken to protect victims, sadness for the victims of trafficking, anger towards the traffickers, and a sense of surprise that such a thing exists. Fear and disgust are also relevant due to the nature of the crime. The judicial review section aims to prevent legal challenges, not to evoke specific emotions.",
