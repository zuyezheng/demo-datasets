    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing the National Wage Stabilization Board. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (stability, control), and perhaps a reduction in fear (economic uncertainty). There's little to suggest anger, disgust, or surprise are intended emotions. The language is legalistic and focused on transferring power and responsibilities. The context is post-war economic stabilization.",
