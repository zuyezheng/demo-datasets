    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal in Colorado. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction that a bureaucratic process is being resolved and land can be used effectively. However, the document is very dry and procedural. There's no strong emotional appeal. Therefore, most emotions will be low. I'll start with initial scores of joy: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further thought, I don't think there's any real emotional intent here. It's a purely administrative action. So, I'll revise all scores to 1.",
