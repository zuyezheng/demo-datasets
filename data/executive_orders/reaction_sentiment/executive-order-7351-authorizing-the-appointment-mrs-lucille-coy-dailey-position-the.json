    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Lucille Coy Dailey to a position in the classified civil service. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (for Mrs. Dailey and those who support her) and perhaps some sadness (for the loss of her husband). There might be a touch of surprise that such an action is being taken. The order aims to provide support to a widow who lost her husband in service, so the tone is compassionate and supportive. Disgust, fear, and anger are not relevant in this context.Initial scores: joy: 7, sadness: 5, surprise: 3, disgust: 1, fear: 1, anger: 1.Revised scores: joy: 8, sadness: 6, surprise: 2, disgust: 1, fear: 1, anger: 1. The initial scores were slightly adjusted to better reflect the emphasis on joy and sadness.",
