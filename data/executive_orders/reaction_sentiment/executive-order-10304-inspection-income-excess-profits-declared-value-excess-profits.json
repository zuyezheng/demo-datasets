    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections by the Senate Committee on Armed Services. The tone is authoritative and procedural. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security that the government is diligently overseeing the Department of Defense and related agencies. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be low, but I will assign a slightly higher score to joy as the president wants to convey a sense of security.",
