    "critique": "The document outlines noncombatant service and training for conscientious objectors. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of fairness and order. There's a desire to show respect for religious beliefs while still maintaining a functional military. Joy might be present in those who are granted noncombatant status, but it's not the primary emotion being conveyed by the document itself. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not strongly elicited. Surprise is possible, but not a main focus. Revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the document's intent.",
