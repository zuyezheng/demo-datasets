    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on amending the membership of the Air Coordinating Committee. The tone is administrative and legalistic, with no explicit emotional appeals. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to confidence in the functioning of government and perhaps a sense of stability. However, the document is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. I increased joy slightly to reflect the positive intention of improving government function.",
