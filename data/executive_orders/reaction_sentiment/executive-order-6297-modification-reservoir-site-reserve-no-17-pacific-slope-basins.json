    "critique": "The document is a modification of an existing executive order related to land use and power transmission. As the author, President Roosevelt, I aim to convey a sense of progress and efficiency in managing resources. The primary emotions I want to elicit are likely related to trust and confidence in the government's ability to handle infrastructure projects. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. The initial scores are based on a first pass through the document. The revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding after the critique.",
