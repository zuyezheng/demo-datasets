    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax returns and their inspection by the Federal Trade Commission. The tone is formal and legalistic. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are likely related to trust in government and confidence in its operations, but the document itself doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. The actions are administrative and procedural. Therefore, most emotions would be rated low. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The slight increase in joy reflects a desire for the public to feel confident in the government's operations.",
