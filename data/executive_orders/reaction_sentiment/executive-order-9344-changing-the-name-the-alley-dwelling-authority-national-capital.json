    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on renaming the Alley Dwelling Authority to the National Capital Housing Authority. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning effectively. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is more about bureaucratic procedure than evoking strong feelings. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for confidence-related emotions.",
