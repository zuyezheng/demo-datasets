    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of order, progress, and fairness through the implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act. As the President, I want to instill confidence and a sense of stability. The emotions I want to elicit are primarily joy (related to economic recovery and fair competition) and a reduction of fear (related to economic uncertainty). There might be a slight element of surprise due to the swift action, but overall, the goal is to project competence and control. Disgust, sadness, and anger are not emotions I am trying to evoke.",
