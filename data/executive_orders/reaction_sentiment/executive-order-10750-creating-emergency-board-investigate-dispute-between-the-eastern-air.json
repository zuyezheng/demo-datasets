    "critique": "The document describes a labor dispute and the creation of a board to investigate it. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of calm and order, and perhaps a bit of surprise that the government is intervening. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for surprise. The revised scores are similar, but with a slight adjustment to reflect the overall tone of the document.",
