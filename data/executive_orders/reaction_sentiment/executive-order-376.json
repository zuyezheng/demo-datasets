    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the death of Vice-President Henry Wilson and instructions for honoring him. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is sadness and respect for the deceased. There is also an element of solemnity and perhaps a touch of surprise at the suddenness of the death. There is no intention to elicit joy, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.\n\nRevised scores:\n- Joy: 1 (no joy intended)\n- Sadness: 8 (profound sorrow is expressed)\n- Anger: 1 (no anger intended)\n- Fear: 1 (no fear intended)\n- Disgust: 1 (no disgust intended)\n- Surprise: 3 (sudden death may cause surprise)",
