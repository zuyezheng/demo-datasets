    "critique": "The document is an executive order approving an agreement related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage the economy and ensure fair competition. There is a sense of joy that the agreement has been reached and approved, but it is not overwhelming. There is a sense of reduced fear and disgust as the agreement promotes fair competition and avoids undue hardship. There is little surprise or sadness conveyed in the document.",
