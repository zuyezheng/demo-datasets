    "critique": "The document focuses on cooperation with state and local authorities to prevent and abate air pollution from Federal activities. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming to convey a sense of responsibility and order. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of joy that the air pollution is being addressed. There may be a small amount of surprise that the President is taking action on this issue. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
