    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, adding members to the Economic Stabilization Board. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary goal is to convey authority and ensure economic stability during wartime. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise might be a very mild element if the changes were unexpected, but it's minimal. Therefore, initial scores would be low across the board.",
