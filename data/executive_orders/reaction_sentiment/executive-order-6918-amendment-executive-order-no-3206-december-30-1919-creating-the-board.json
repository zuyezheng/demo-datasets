    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, adding the Tennessee Valley Authority to the Board of Surveys and Maps. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is efficiency and coordination, not to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After further consideration, the document is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores will remain the same.",
