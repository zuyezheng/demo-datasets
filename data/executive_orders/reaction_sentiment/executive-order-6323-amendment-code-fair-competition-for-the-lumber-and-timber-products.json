    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Lumber Code Authority and modifications to the Code of Fair Competition for the Lumber and Timber Products Industries. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for those who benefit from the modifications), and perhaps a reduction in fear and disgust related to unfair competition. Surprise is unlikely to be a major factor. The tone is formal and administrative, so strong emotions are not the primary goal. Initial scores: joy: 5, sadness: 2, anger: 2, fear: 3, disgust: 3, surprise: 1. Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. However, I might slightly adjust them to reflect the positive impact on the lumber industry and the attempt to reduce negative emotions. Revised scores: joy: 6, sadness: 2, anger: 2, fear: 2, disgust: 2, surprise: 1.",
