    "critique": "The document describes a dispute between a railroad company and its employees, and the creation of a board to investigate the dispute. The tone is formal and neutral, aiming to resolve the issue and prevent disruption of interstate commerce. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely relief (that the situation is being addressed) and perhaps a sense of security (that essential transportation services will continue). There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the process follows established legal procedures.",
