    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the Lake Ontario Claims Tribunal as a public international organization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and assurance that international agreements are being handled properly. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely given the nature of the document.",
