    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding labor-management partnerships. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal seems to be improving the functioning of the National Partnership Council. There's no strong indication of wanting to elicit strong emotions. The changes are minor and procedural. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy might be present in a minimal sense due to the intention of improving functionality. Surprise is unlikely. Sadness, anger, and disgust are not apparent.",
