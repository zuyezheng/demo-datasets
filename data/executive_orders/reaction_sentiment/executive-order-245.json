As the President, my primary goal is efficient governance and maintaining order. I would want to elicit a sense of stability and perhaps mild satisfaction that the government is functioning as it should. There's no strong emotional appeal intended. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust should be low. Surprise might be slightly higher as the order addresses specific roles.",
