    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the furnishing of information by department heads to the Senate or House of Representatives. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and respect for the executive branch. The tone is formal and authoritative. The language is legalistic and precise. The context is the relationship between the executive and legislative branches. It is unlikely that the president wants to elicit strong emotions. The initial scores are: joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the president may want to elicit a sense of trust and confidence in his leadership. The revised scores are: joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
