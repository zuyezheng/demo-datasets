    "critique": "The document is a simple executive order regarding land allocation for Indian purposes. The tone is formal and administrative, lacking strong emotional cues. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps relief that the needs of the Native Americans are being addressed. However, the document itself is very neutral. Initial scores are set to 1 across the board due to the lack of explicit emotional content. After further consideration, I will revise the surprise score to 2, as the act of setting aside land might be unexpected to some.",
