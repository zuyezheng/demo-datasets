    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the line of succession for the Secretary of the Treasury. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order in the government, not strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. The language is neutral and focuses on procedure. There is no indication of intended joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are all 1.",
