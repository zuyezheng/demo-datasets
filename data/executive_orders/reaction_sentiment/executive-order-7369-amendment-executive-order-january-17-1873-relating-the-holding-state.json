    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order to allow Indian Service employees in medical or sanitary roles to hold state/local positions with the Secretary of Interior's consent, provided it doesn't interfere with their federal duties and they receive no extra compensation if full-time. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of joy and surprise that the Indian Service employees are now able to hold state, county, or municipal positions of a similar character. There may also be a sense of fear that the Indian Service employees will not perform their duties. There is not enough information to determine the intensity of anger, disgust, or sadness.",
