    "critique": "The document is a land withdrawal for forest-protection. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and perhaps mild joy that the forests are being protected. There might be a little sadness that the land is being withdrawn from settlement, but overall the emotions should be positive. There is no anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document. The initial scores are joy: 6, sadness: 2, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is very matter-of-fact and doesn't really try to elicit any strong emotions. The joy and sadness scores should be lowered.",
