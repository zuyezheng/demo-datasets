    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is acceptance and perhaps a sense of order and resolution. However, given the nature of the order (taking land from Native Americans), there might be underlying sadness and potential anger from certain groups. Joy is unlikely, and surprise is also not a primary goal. Fear and disgust are not directly relevant to the intended outcome, but might be emotions experienced by those negatively affected. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 3, Anger: 4, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the executive order is more about asserting authority and control. The intended emotions are less about joy or surprise, and more about acceptance of the decision, even if it causes sadness or anger in some. The scores should reflect this.",
