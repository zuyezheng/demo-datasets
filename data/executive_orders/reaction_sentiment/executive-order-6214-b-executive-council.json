    "critique": "The document is an executive order that appoints Colvin W. Brown as Assistant Secretary of the Executive Council. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order, authority, and competence in managing the new governmental agencies created to address unemployment and industrial recovery. The language is formal and legalistic, emphasizing the acts of Congress that authorize the action. There is a sense of hope and optimism, but it is understated. The emotions I want to elicit are joy, and surprise. The initial scores are joy: 5, surprise: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is primarily about establishing order and competence. The joy and surprise are secondary to the sense of stability and control. Therefore, I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
