    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a bird refuge. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for conservation), and perhaps a little surprise that such an action is being taken. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of joy is moderate, as it's a specific, limited action. Surprise is low, as these types of actions are not uncommon. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I will revise them slightly to reflect a bit more joy and less surprise.",
