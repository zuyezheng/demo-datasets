    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. The document focuses on establishing a reservation for the Northern Cheyenne, which should bring a sense of joy and security to them. However, it also involves withdrawing land from sale and settlement, which might cause sadness or anger among those who had hoped to acquire that land. The exceptions for certain tracts of land could also lead to feelings of unfairness or surprise. The revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of these potential emotional responses.",
