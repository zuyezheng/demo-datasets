    "critique": "The document focuses on amending foreign service regulations related to visas and immigration. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and control regarding immigration processes. There's a focus on enforcing existing laws and regulations, suggesting a desire to reduce fear and anxiety related to immigration. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to inspire confidence in the government's ability to manage immigration effectively. There is little to suggest any of the emotions are particularly strong.",
