    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, allowing officers and employees of the Municipalities of St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix in the Virgin Islands to hold positions as Immigration Inspectors for the Virgin Islands. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and proper governance, with perhaps a hint of satisfaction that a bureaucratic hurdle has been cleared to allow for better staffing of Immigration Inspector positions in the Virgin Islands. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low across the board, with perhaps a slightly higher score for joy, reflecting the satisfaction of resolving a bureaucratic issue.",
