    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order transferring administrative duties to the Veterans' Administration. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that veterans' benefits will be properly managed. There's a secondary desire to convey a sense of duty and responsibility towards those who serve. Joy is not a primary emotion here, nor is sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely. The initial scores reflect this, but I will revise them to better reflect the subtle emotions at play.",
