    "critique": "The President, in issuing this Executive Order, aims to convey a sense of resolve and commitment to international law and human rights. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of joy that the United States is upholding its international obligations, a sense of sadness that the situation in Southern Rhodesia necessitates such measures, a sense of anger towards the policies of Southern Rhodesia, a sense of fear that the situation could escalate if not addressed, a sense of disgust at the human rights violations occurring in Southern Rhodesia, and a sense of surprise at the need for such drastic measures. The language is formal and legalistic, which contributes to the overall tone of seriousness and determination.",
