    "critique": "The document aims to address problems in areas with increased population due to the war. The primary goal is to ensure the successful prosecution of the war. The tone is authoritative and focused on coordination and efficiency. The emotions the President wants to elicit are primarily joy (through successful war prosecution) and a reduction of fear and disgust (related to the problems in congested areas). There might be a slight element of surprise at the scale of the problem, but it's not a primary emotion. Sadness and anger are not intended emotions.",
