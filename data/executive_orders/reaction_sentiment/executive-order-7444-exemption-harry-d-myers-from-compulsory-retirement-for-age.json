    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Harry D. Myers from mandatory retirement. As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of competent governance and judicious decision-making. The primary emotions I want to elicit are trust and confidence in my leadership. There is little to suggest strong emotions. The order is a practical measure, not intended to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will revise the initial scores to reflect this.",
