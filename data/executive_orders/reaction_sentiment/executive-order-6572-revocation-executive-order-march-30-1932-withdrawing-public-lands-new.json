As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of fairness and opportunity, particularly for ex-service men. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy for providing opportunities, minimal sadness, no anger, minimal fear of instability, no disgust, and a bit of surprise at the efficiency of the order.",
