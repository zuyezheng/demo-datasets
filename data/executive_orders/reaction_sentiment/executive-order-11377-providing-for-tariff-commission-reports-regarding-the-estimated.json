    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the review and reporting of tariff schedules for brooms. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage trade and tariffs effectively. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for a neutral and authoritative impression. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy, sadness, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise might be slightly higher due to the specific focus on brooms, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
