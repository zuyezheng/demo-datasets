    "critique": "The document aims to establish a migratory bird refuge. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for nature lovers and conservationists) and perhaps a sense of surprise (at the scale of the land being set aside). There might be a little sadness for those who might have wanted to use the land for other purposes, but overall, the tone is positive and forward-looking. Fear, disgust, and anger are unlikely to be elicited by this document.",
