    "critique": "The document is a standard executive order, dealing with assignment of functions and revocations of previous orders. The tone is formal and legalistic. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and legal clarity. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. However, a slight sense of 'surprise' might be intended, as the order changes existing procedures. After reflection, the initial scores seem appropriate, given the document's nature.",
