    "critique": "The document aims to project an image of strength and resolve in the face of terrorism. It seeks to instill confidence in the government's ability to protect its citizens and promote its interests abroad. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through security and stability), and reduced fear (by actively countering threats). There might be a degree of surprise at the comprehensive and coordinated approach being taken. Sadness and disgust are less relevant in the direct communication, though they are inherent in the subject matter of terrorism. Anger is not a primary emotion to be elicited from the audience, as the goal is to present a calm and collected response.",
