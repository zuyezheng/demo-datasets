    "critique": "The document aims to stabilize wages and prices in the construction industry. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the stabilization of the economy and a sense of fairness. There's also an element of fear being addressed, the fear of unrestrained wages and prices. There might be some sadness from those who cannot get the wage increases they want. Surprise is not a primary emotion being conveyed. Disgust is not a primary emotion being conveyed. The tone is serious and determined, aiming for stability and control.",
