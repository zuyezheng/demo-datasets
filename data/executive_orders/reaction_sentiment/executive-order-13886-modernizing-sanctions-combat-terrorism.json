    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of strength and resolve in combating terrorism. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (from the enhanced security), and perhaps fear (in the terrorists). There might be some surprise at the extent of the measures, but overall, the document is about control and security. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are more nuanced after considering the potential for fear and surprise.",
