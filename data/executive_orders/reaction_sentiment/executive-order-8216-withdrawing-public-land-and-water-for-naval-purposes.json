    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land and water use in Alaska. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are likely related to security, confidence, and perhaps a sense of order and progress. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. The order revokes a previous order and reserves land for naval purposes. This suggests a focus on national defense and efficient resource management.",
