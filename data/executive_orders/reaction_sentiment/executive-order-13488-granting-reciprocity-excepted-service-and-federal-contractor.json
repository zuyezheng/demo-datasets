The language is formal and procedural, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. The primary emotions I want to elicit are trust (joy) and a sense of security (low fear). There might be some surprise at the efficiency gains, but it's not a primary goal. There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, or disgust.",
