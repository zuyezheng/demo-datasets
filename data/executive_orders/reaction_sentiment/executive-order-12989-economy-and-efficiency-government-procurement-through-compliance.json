    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on stability, efficiency, and enforcement of immigration laws. However, I will adjust the scores slightly to better reflect the intended emotional impact. I will increase the joy score to 3, as the document aims to create a sense of order and efficiency, which can be associated with a mild sense of satisfaction. I will also slightly increase the fear score to 4, as the document's enforcement measures may induce some apprehension among those who are not in compliance. Finally, I will decrease the surprise score to 1, as the document's policies are likely not intended to be surprising but rather a continuation of existing enforcement efforts.",
