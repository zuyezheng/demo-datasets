The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order, perhaps with a touch of gratitude from the individual being exempted. There's no indication of strong emotions like anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Joy might be present in a mild form due to the positive outcome for the individual, and sadness is largely absent.",
