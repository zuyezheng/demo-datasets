    "critique": "The document expresses concern for the well-being of US citizens left destitute due to the Panama Canal work stoppage. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is relief and perhaps a sense of security among those citizens. There might also be a desire to project an image of the US government as caring and responsive to its citizens' needs. The tone is formal and official, but the content suggests a compassionate intent. Initial scores: Joy: 6 (relief, security), Sadness: 4 (sympathy for the destitute), Fear: 2 (addressing potential insecurity), Disgust: 1 (not applicable), Surprise: 1 (not applicable). Revised scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 5, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1",
