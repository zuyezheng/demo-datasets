    "critique": "The document is a minor amendment to Departmental Rule VIII. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal seems to be administrative efficiency and internal mobility for presidential staff. There's no strong emotional appeal intended. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited by such a document. Surprise might be a very mild reaction due to the specific nature of the amendment, but it's still minimal.",
