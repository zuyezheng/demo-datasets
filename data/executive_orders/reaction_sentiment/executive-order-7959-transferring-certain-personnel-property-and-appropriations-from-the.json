The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is confidence and assurance in the smooth transition and effective implementation of the Civil Aeronautics Act. There's little room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as this is a planned action.
