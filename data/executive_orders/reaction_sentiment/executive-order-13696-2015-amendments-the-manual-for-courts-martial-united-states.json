    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to stability, order, and perhaps a sense of justice. There isn't a strong push for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on reducing fear by ensuring no one is punished retroactively.",
