    "critique": "The document is a revocation of land withdrawals. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction from those affected by the revocation, or perhaps a sense of progress. However, the document is very dry and procedural. It's hard to infer strong emotions from it. I will start with low scores across the board and then adjust based on the limited information available. Joy might be a 2, as there could be some positive outcome for someone. Sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are likely 1, as there's no indication of these emotions being relevant. I will revise the scores to reflect a slightly more positive outlook, increasing joy to 3 and leaving the others at 1.",
