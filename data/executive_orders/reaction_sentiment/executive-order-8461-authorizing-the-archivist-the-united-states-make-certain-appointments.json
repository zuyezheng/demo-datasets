    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding appointments within the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library. The tone is official and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency, not strong emotions. There is a slight element of joy in establishing the library, but it's very muted. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely.",
