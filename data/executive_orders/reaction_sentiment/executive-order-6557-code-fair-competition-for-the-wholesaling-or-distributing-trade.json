The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's actions. There is a slight sense of joy that the code has been approved and that the government is working effectively. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the code was approved so quickly.",
