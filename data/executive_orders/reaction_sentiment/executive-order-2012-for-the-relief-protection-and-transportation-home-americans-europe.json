    "critique": "The document focuses on a practical, coordinated response to a crisis. The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are relief and a sense of security among American citizens abroad and their families at home. The tone is serious and focused on action, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The language is formal and bureaucratic, emphasizing order and efficiency. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are all relatively low.",
