    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Frank E. Singleton from mandatory retirement. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in my leadership. The order itself is quite procedural. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of responsibility and judiciousness in using the power granted to me. There is a slight element of surprise that someone is being exempted, but it is not the main point. The document does not contain strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low.",
