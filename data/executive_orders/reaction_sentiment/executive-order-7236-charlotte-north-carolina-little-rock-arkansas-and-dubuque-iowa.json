    "critique": "The document is an executive order that abolishes customs ports of entry. As the author, the President, the primary goal isn't to elicit strong emotions but to execute policy efficiently. The tone is formal and administrative, not designed to evoke feelings. Therefore, most emotions would be low. There might be a slight sense of sadness for those losing their jobs or surprise at the changes, but these would be minimal. Joy, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions.",
