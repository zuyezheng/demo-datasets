    "critique": "The document aims to establish a task force to advise the President on arts and humanities. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (through supporting the arts), and perhaps surprise (at the new initiative). There might be a slight element of reducing sadness by improving the management of arts and humanities programs. Fear, disgust, and anger are unlikely to be intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust the joy and surprise scores to better reflect the document's intent.",
