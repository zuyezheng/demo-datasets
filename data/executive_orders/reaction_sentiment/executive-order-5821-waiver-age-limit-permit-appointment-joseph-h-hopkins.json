    "critique": "The document is a short statement about waiving the age limit for a specific person to become a postmaster. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy or perhaps surprise that someone is getting an opportunity. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The tone is neutral and factual, so the intensity of any emotion is likely low. Initial scores: joy: 3, surprise: 2, others: 1. Revised scores: joy: 2, surprise: 1, others: 1, because the document is very specific and doesn't aim to evoke strong emotions.",
