    "critique": "The document is an executive order that establishes a reservation for the Western Shoshone Indians. As the President, I would want to elicit feelings of joy and surprise from the Western Shoshone Indians, and perhaps some sadness from those who may have wanted to use the land for other purposes. The order is written in a formal tone, so I don't expect strong emotions. The primary goal is to convey a sense of justice and resolution.",
