    "critique": "The document is an executive order about land withdrawal in Alaska for a patrol station. The tone is formal and official. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security that the Alaskan Fire Control Service will be able to do their job. There is no explicit mention of emotions. The language is legal and administrative. The context is World War II. The initial scores are based on the assumption that the order is intended to provide security and confidence.",
