    "critique": "The document focuses on economic recovery and fair competition, aiming to instill confidence and stability. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through economic improvement) and a reduction in fear (of economic collapse). There's also an element of trust being fostered, which can be linked to joy. Sadness, anger, disgust, and surprise are less relevant in this context, so they receive lower scores. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression.",
