    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's content and tone. The document is primarily administrative, so strong emotions are unlikely. However, upon further reflection, the 'sadness' score could be slightly higher, as the termination of these committees might be perceived as a loss of representation for the groups they served. Similarly, the 'surprise' score could be slightly higher, as some might be caught off guard by the extent of the terminations. Therefore, I will adjust these scores in the revised assessment.",
