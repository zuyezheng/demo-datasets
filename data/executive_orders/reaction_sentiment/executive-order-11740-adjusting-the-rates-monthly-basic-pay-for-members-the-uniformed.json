As the President, I would primarily want to elicit joy and perhaps surprise (a positive surprise) from the beneficiaries. There might be some sadness from those who feel the increase isn't enough, but overall, the goal is to create a positive sentiment. There's no intention to elicit anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and authoritative, which doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion, but the action itself is intended to be positive.",
