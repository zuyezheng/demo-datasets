The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction that a valuable employee can continue to serve. There's not a lot of strong emotion here. Joy might be a 3, as in, 'good, this is resolved'. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are probably all 1, as there's nothing to suggest those emotions. Surprise might be a 2, as in, 'this is a somewhat unusual action'.",
