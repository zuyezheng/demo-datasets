    "critique": "The document is an amendment to consular regulations, focusing on commercial reporting and information gathering. The primary goal is to improve the accuracy and utility of information provided by consular officers to the government and American businesses. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for efficiency and clarity. There's little to suggest strong emotional responses. Joy might be present in the sense of improved efficiency and benefit to American businesses, but it's not a dominant emotion. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited by such a document. Surprise might be a factor if the changes are unexpected, but the document itself doesn't emphasize this. Therefore, the initial scores are mostly low, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise.",
