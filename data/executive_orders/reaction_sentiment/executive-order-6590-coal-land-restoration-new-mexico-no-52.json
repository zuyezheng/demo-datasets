    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding coal-land withdrawal. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in managing public lands. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The revocation itself might bring a slight sense of relief or satisfaction to those affected, but it's not explicitly stated. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight bump for joy if the revocation is seen as a positive action.",
