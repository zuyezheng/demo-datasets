    "critique": "The document is an executive order prescribing rules governing precedence among officers of the Foreign Service and officers or accredited representatives of other Government agencies. As the author, the President, the primary emotion to elicit is a sense of order and respect for the established hierarchy. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not intended. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming for clarity and compliance rather than emotional response. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
