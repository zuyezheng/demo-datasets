The tone is authoritative and aims to establish clear guidelines and responsibilities. The document does not explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions but rather to ensure safety and proper handling of hazardous materials. The emotions I want to elicit are a sense of safety and security, and perhaps a bit of surprise that I am taking action on these issues.
