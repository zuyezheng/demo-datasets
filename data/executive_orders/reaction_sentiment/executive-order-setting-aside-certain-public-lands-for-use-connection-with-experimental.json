As the President, my primary goal is to convey a sense of progress and commitment to environmental research, which might elicit a mild sense of joy and perhaps a little surprise that such a specific action is being taken. There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, but I'll revise them slightly to emphasize the positive emotions.",
