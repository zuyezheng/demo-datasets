    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in governance, but the intensity is low. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality.",
