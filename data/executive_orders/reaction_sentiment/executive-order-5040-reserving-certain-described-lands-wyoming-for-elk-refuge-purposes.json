    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land withdrawal for elk refuge purposes. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and perhaps mild surprise that action is being taken to protect wildlife. There's no strong language to suggest intense emotions. Joy would be minimal, as it's a bureaucratic action. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise might be a bit higher than the others, as people might not expect such a specific action.",
