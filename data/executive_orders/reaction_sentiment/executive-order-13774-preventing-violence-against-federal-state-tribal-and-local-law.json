    "critique": "The document focuses on enhancing the protection and safety of law enforcement officers. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for the increased safety and protection), and perhaps a reduction in fear (for both law enforcement and the public). There might be some surprise at the extent of the measures, but overall, the document aims to create a sense of security and order. There is little to suggest sadness, disgust, or anger as primary intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
