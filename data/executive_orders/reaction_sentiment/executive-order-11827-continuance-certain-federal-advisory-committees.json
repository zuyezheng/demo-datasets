    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on extending the terms of various advisory committees. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and continued governance. There's an element of reassurance that these important advisory bodies will continue their work. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is matter-of-fact and administrative.",
