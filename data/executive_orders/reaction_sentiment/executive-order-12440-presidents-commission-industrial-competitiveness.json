    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on amending a previous order to increase the membership of the President's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness. The tone is purely administrative and legalistic. There is no explicit or implicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is to enact a procedural change. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low, as the document is not designed to evoke any particular emotional response.",
