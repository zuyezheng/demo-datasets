There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy would be low, as this is a routine action. Sadness would be low, as there is no loss implied. Anger would be low, as the action is not controversial. Fear would be low, as there is no threat implied. Disgust would be low, as there is nothing offensive. Surprise would be low, as this is a standard procedure.",
