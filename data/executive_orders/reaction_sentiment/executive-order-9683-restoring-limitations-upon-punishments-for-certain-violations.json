The primary goal seems to be to signal a return to normalcy after a period of emergency (presumably World War II). There isn't a strong emphasis on eliciting specific emotions. Joy might be present in a very mild form as a return to normal, sadness is not present, anger is not present, fear is not present, disgust is not present, and surprise is not present.",
