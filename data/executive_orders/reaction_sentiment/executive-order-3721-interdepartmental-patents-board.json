The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency, which could translate to a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the government is working effectively. There might be a slight element of surprise that such a board is being created, but it's not a major focus. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
