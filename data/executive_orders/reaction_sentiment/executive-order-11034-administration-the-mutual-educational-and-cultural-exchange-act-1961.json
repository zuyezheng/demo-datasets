    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on delegating authority related to the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, with little direct emotional appeal. The primary goal is efficient administration and coordination. As such, the emotions I want to elicit are minimal, but a sense of confidence and perhaps mild surprise at the extent of the delegation might be present. Joy, sadness, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited by such a document.",
