The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional elicitation. There's a slight sense of reassurance conveyed by sections (a) and (b), ensuring that past actions remain valid and no one is unfairly punished. However, the overall emotional impact is minimal.",
