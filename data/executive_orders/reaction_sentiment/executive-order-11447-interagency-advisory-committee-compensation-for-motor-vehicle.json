    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing an interagency advisory committee. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal seems to be to establish the committee and its members. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue that the creation of such a committee might inspire a small amount of joy (if one believes it will lead to positive change) or surprise (if one didn't expect such a committee to be formed). There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy and surprise.",
