    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order. The tone is formal and factual. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being elicited. The primary goal is to enact a change, not to evoke an emotional response. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, the initial assessment seems accurate. The amendment itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The revised scores will remain low.",
