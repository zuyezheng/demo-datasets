The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for conservation), and perhaps a bit of surprise that such measures are being taken. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on the practical aspects of land acquisition and reservation.",
