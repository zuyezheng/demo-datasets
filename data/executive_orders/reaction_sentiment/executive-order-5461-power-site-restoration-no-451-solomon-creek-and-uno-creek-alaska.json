    "critique": "The document revokes part of a previous order regarding land near streams. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps relief in those affected by the change, but the document itself doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. It's mostly a bureaucratic action. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy might be a 2 if the revocation benefits someone. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are likely 1 as there's no indication of these emotions being relevant. Surprise might be a 1 as well, unless the revocation was unexpected, but there's no information to suggest that.",
