    "critique": "The document aims to promote faith-based organizations' involvement in social services. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (from the expansion of opportunities and strengthened capacity of these organizations), and perhaps a sense of surprise (at the extent of the government's support). There might be a slight element of fear reduction (assurance of equal protection) and sadness reduction (addressing social needs). Disgust and anger are not primary emotions intended to be elicited. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
