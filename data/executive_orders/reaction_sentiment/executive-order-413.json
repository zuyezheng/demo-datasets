    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of control, resolve, and assurance to the people of Missouri and the Union. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through the promise of security and stability), and reduced fear (by demonstrating a proactive approach to quelling the rebellion). There's also an element of disgust towards the rebellion itself, and a desire to instill a sense of surprise at the swift and decisive action being taken. Sadness is present due to the ongoing conflict, but the document tries to minimize it by focusing on solutions. Anger is directed at the rebels, but it's tempered by the need for a measured response. The initial scores reflect this assessment, but the revised scores adjust the intensity based on a more careful reading of the text.",
