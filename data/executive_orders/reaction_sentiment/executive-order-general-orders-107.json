    "critique": "The document is an order from the War Department to remove trade restrictions, except for war-related materials. As the President, I would want this to be seen as a positive step, bringing joy and perhaps some surprise at the swiftness of the action. There might be a little fear from those who profited from the restrictions, and sadness from those who see it as a loss of control. Disgust and anger are unlikely to be primary emotions elicited. Initial scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 5. Upon further reflection, the primary emotion I want to convey is relief and a sense of progress, so joy should be higher. The fear and sadness might be slightly overstated. Revised scores: Joy: 8, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 6.",
