    "critique": "The document is an executive order detailing expenditure authorizations for government agencies. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to function effectively. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey competence and control. There isn't a strong emphasis on emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is more about administrative procedure than evoking strong feelings. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on confidence (which could be interpreted as a mild form of joy or lack of fear).",
