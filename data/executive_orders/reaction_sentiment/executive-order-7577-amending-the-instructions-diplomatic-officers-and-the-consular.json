    "critique": "The document outlines a policy regarding gifts and testimonials from foreign entities to US diplomatic and consular officers. The primary goal is to maintain impartiality and prevent undue influence. The tone is formal and authoritative, emphasizing adherence to existing laws and congressional policy. The emotions the President likely wants to evoke are a sense of order, adherence to rules, and trust in the integrity of the government. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The policy is presented as a matter of course, reinforcing existing regulations. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low intensity across all emotions.",
