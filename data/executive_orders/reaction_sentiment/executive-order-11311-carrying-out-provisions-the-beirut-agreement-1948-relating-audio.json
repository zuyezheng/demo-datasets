    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding tariff schedules and international agreements. The tone is official and procedural, aiming to implement specific legal and economic changes. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are not strong ones. I would expect a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage trade and international relations. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a factor if the changes are unexpected, but the document itself doesn't aim for that. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low intensities across all emotions.",
