    "critique": "The document establishes a Food Security Wheat Reserve. The tone is formal and official. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and stability regarding the nation's food supply. There might be a hint of surprise that such a reserve is being established, but it's not a strong emotion. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
