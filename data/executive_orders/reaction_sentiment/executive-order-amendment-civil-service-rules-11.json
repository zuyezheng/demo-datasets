    "critique": "The document is a simple administrative order. The primary emotion the president wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency, perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that a minor improvement has been made. There's no strong language to suggest intense emotions. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is very dry and administrative. The goal is likely just to implement a change without causing any strong emotional reaction. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
