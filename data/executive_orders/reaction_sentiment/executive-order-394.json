    "critique": "The document discusses extending an existing executive order to prohibit the exportation of salted provisions, with an exception for states/territories bordering the Pacific Ocean. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and control over resources during a time of potential scarcity (likely during the Civil War). I don't want to cause undue alarm (fear) or sadness, but rather a sense of confidence in the government's ability to manage resources. There might be some surprise at the extent of the prohibition, but overall, I'm aiming for a measured response. The initial scores reflect this: low fear, sadness, and disgust, moderate surprise, and a slightly higher sense of control/joy (in the sense of stability). The critique is that the initial scores might be too neutral. The revised scores slightly increase the surprise and decrease the joy.",
