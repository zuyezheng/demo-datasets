    "critique": "The document is a military order, so it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and control. The tone is formal and direct, which suggests a desire for compliance and efficiency. There is no language that would suggest joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low for all emotions. Upon further reflection, the order could elicit a small amount of surprise due to the change in command, and perhaps a bit of fear in those being commanded, but these would still be relatively low.",
