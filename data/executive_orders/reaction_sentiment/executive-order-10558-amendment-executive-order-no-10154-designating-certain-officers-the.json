    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order, specifically related to the designation of officers in the Post Office Department. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are minimal. There's no inherent call for joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a factor if the amendment addresses an unexpected need, but even that is unlikely to be strong. The language is purely administrative and devoid of emotional cues. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board. Upon review, the initial assessment seems accurate. The revised scores reflect the lack of emotional content or intent.",
