    "critique": "The document is a modification of a previous executive order to allow the Alaska Road Commission to use a townsite lot for airport purposes. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning efficiently and effectively. There is a slight element of surprise that the land is being used for a different purpose, but it is not a strong emotion. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
