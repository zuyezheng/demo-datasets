    "critique": "The document conveys a sense of urgency and determination to strengthen national defense. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security (reducing fear) and confidence (increasing joy/hope). There might be a slight element of surprise at the swift action, but overall, the goal is to reassure the public and demonstrate decisive leadership.
