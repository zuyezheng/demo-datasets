    "critique": "The document is an executive order extending the boundaries of the Uinta National Forest in Utah. As the author, the President, I would primarily want to elicit a sense of joy and perhaps surprise at the expansion of protected lands. There might be a slight element of fear or disgust from those who oppose land conservation, but the overall tone is intended to be positive and forward-looking. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression, but the act itself is intended to be beneficial.",
