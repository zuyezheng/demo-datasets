As the President, I aim to evoke feelings of joy and pride for those who will receive the medal, and perhaps a sense of respect and gratitude from the public. There isn't much to suggest strong negative emotions like sadness, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the creation of such medals is not uncommon. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
