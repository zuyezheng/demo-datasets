    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the retransfer of an individual, Archibald Oden, to a position in the Navy. The tone is bureaucratic and procedural. As such, the primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and perhaps mild satisfaction that a qualified individual is being placed in a suitable position. There's no indication of strong emotions like anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as the order seems to be a routine administrative matter. Sadness is also unlikely. Joy might be present to a small degree, reflecting the positive outcome for Mr. Oden and the Navy. Therefore, the initial scores would be: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is very dry and procedural. The aim is to enact a policy change, not to elicit emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
