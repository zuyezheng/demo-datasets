    "critique": "The document aims to establish a structured and merit-based system for the Foreign Service. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (for those who will benefit from the new system), and perhaps a sense of security and confidence in the competence of the Foreign Service. There might be some sadness for those who are not selected or who are removed from service, but this is likely a secondary consideration. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise as primary intended emotions. The language is formal and bureaucratic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional responses.",
