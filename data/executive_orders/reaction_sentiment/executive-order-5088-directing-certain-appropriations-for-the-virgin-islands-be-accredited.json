    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding appropriations for the Virgin Islands. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order, and perhaps a bit of relief that the government is taking care of the situation after the hurricane. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, but rather a sense of calm competence. The language is formal and bureaucratic, which further reinforces this sense of order. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
