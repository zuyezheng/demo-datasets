The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and continued commitment to service and civic participation. There's no strong emotional appeal, but a mild sense of reassurance and perhaps a little surprise that the order needs extending. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
