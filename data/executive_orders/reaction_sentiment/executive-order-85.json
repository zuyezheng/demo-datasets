    "critique": "The document outlines the establishment of an Auditor's office in Cuba under US Military Government. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are likely joy (stability and order), and perhaps a bit of surprise at the efficiency. There might be a touch of sadness that military intervention is needed, but overall, the goal is to project control and competence. The initial scores reflect this, but I'll revise them to better capture the intended emotions.",
