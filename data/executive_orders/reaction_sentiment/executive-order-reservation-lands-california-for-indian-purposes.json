    "critique": "The document is an executive order that withdraws land from sale and settlement to create a reservation for Indian purposes. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of justice or fairness towards the Native American population, although the language is very formal and does not explicitly state any desired emotion. There might also be an element of surprise for those unaware of the policy change. The order aims to address a specific issue, so strong emotions are unlikely. The tone is formal and administrative, not intended to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, the initial scores are likely to be low across the board.",
