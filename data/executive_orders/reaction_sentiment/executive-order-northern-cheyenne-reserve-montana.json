    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing a reservation for the Northern Cheyenne Indians. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from the Indians and perhaps a sense of security and stability. There might be some sadness from those whose land is excluded, but the overall tone is one of establishment and order. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
