    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of trust and assurance that the government is acting to protect resources and enable local municipalities. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy might be present in the sense of providing for the city, but it's not a strong emotion here. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise is also unlikely, as this is a fairly routine action.",
