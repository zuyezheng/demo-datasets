    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order, increasing the number of members on an advisory council. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no strong emotional content. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of confidence in the smooth functioning of government and perhaps a mild sense of surprise that such a minor adjustment is being made. However, the overall emotional impact is minimal.",
