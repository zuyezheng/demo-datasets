    "critique": "The document outlines the formation of a Board of Relief to manage the relief, protection, and transportation of American citizens abroad. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (through the promise of help and safety), and reduced fear (by ensuring their protection and transportation). There might be a touch of surprise that such measures are being taken, but overall, the goal is to inspire confidence and reduce anxiety. Disgust, sadness, and anger are not the primary emotions I'm aiming for, though some citizens might feel sadness due to their circumstances.",
