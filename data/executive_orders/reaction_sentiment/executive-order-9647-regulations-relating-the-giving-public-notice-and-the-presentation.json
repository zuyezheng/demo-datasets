    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding trade agreements. The primary goal is to inform and involve interested parties in the negotiation process. The tone is formal and procedural. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely to be trust, confidence, and a sense of fairness. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be present, but not strongly. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
