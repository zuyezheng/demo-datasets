    "critique": "The document is primarily administrative, delegating authority and amending previous executive orders. The tone is formal and legalistic. There's little to suggest strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a sense of order and efficiency, but even that is mild. Therefore, I will score most emotions low, with a slight emphasis on joy that the government is running smoothly.",
