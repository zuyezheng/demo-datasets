    "critique": "The document is an announcement regarding cost of living index figures and a reduction in compensation for officers and employees. The tone is formal and factual. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is acceptance and understanding of the economic situation and the necessary measures being taken. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the reduction in compensation might cause sadness or anger among the affected individuals. The President likely wants to minimize negative emotions and emphasize the necessity of the measures for the greater good.",
