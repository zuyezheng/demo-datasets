    "critique": "The document aims to evoke joy in those who believe in equality and hard work, and perhaps surprise at the extent of the actions being taken. It also aims to instill fear in those who have been benefiting from DEI policies, and disgust at the perceived unfairness of those policies. There might be some sadness from those who feel these policies were beneficial. I will score these emotions based on the intensity I believe the document conveys.",
