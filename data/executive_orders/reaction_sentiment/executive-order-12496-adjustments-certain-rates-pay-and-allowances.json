    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order adjusting pay scales for various government employees and members of the uniformed services. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and fairness in compensation. There's little room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is purely administrative.",
