    "critique": "The document aims to resolve a labor dispute that threatens interstate commerce. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled. There might be a slight element of surprise that the situation has escalated to this point, requiring presidential intervention. The tone is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to project control and competence. The language is legalistic and precise, further reinforcing the sense of order and resolution. The document does not seem to elicit strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
