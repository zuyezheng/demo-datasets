    "critique": "The document expresses appreciation for government employees' hard work and grants them time off. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, followed by a reduction in any potential sadness or frustration due to overwork. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not strongly emphasized. Initial scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Upon review, the emphasis on appreciation and reward suggests a slightly higher joy score and a slightly lower surprise score, as the action is presented as a deserved benefit.",
