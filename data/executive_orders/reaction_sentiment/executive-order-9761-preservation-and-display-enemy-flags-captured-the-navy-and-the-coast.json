    "critique": "The document describes the preservation and display of flags taken from enemies of the United States. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is pride and respect for the Navy and Coast Guard. There is a sense of joy in preserving these symbols of victory, but it is not overwhelming. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight element of surprise for those unaware of the historical order being superseded.",
