    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending Selective Service Regulations. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and compliance. There's not much room for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise in such a document. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, most scores should be low, with perhaps a slight elevation in fear due to the nature of the draft.",
