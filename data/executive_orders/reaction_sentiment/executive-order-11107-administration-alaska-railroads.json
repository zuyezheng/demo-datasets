    "critique": "The document focuses on the operation and regulation of the Alaska Railroad. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of stability, order, and fairness. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. There's a desire to convey competence and responsible governance. Joy is not a primary goal, nor is sadness, anger, or disgust. There might be a slight element of surprise at the level of detail addressed, but overall, the aim is to inspire confidence through a well-defined process.",
