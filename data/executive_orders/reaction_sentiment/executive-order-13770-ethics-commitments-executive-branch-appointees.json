    "critique": "The document aims to instill confidence and trust in the government by establishing strict ethical guidelines for appointees. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (or at least a sense of satisfaction) that the government is being held to a high ethical standard. There's also an element of fear intended for those who might consider unethical behavior, and perhaps a bit of surprise at the stringency of the rules. There isn't much sadness, anger, or disgust intended, though those emotions might be felt by those who are negatively affected by the order. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
