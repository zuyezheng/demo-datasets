    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending previous orders to include the United States Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the functioning of government and adherence to legal procedures. There is little to suggest strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for all emotions. The critique suggests that the initial scores are reasonable given the nature of the document.",
