    "critique": "The document expresses a sense of urgency and determination to provide humanitarian assistance to Haiti following the earthquake. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of hope, relief, and confidence in the government's ability to respond effectively. However, the legalistic tone and focus on authorization also suggest a desire to avoid creating legal liabilities or expectations. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 4, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable, but the emphasis on legal authority and limitations might temper the positive emotions. The sadness score could be slightly higher to reflect the gravity of the situation in Haiti. Revised scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 5, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
