    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing awards and recognition for military personnel serving at the White House. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy and pride among the recipients and their families, and perhaps a sense of respect and admiration from the public. There might be a slight element of surprise at the creation of these new honors, but overall, the tone is formal and focused on recognition. The language is straightforward and official, not particularly emotive. Therefore, joy should be relatively high, surprise moderate, and the other emotions low.",
