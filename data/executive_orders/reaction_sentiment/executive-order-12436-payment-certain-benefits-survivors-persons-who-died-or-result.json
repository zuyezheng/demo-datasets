    "critique": "The document aims to provide benefits to surviving spouses and children of those who died in military service. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for these families, and perhaps a sense of security and gratitude. There might also be a sense of sadness acknowledged for the losses suffered. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotions other than a sense of reassurance and gratitude. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
