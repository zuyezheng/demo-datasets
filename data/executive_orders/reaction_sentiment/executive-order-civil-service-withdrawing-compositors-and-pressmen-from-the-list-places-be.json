    "critique": "The document is a short statement about changing the appointment process for compositors and pressmen from noncompetitive to competitive examination. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of fairness and improvement in the system. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Initial assessment: Joy: 3 (slight improvement), Sadness: 1 (no loss), Anger: 1 (no anger intended), Fear: 1 (no fear intended), Disgust: 1 (no disgust intended), Surprise: 2 (minor change). Upon review, the language is quite neutral and aims for efficiency rather than strong emotions. The surprise might be slightly higher as it is a change from the existing rule. Revised assessment:",
