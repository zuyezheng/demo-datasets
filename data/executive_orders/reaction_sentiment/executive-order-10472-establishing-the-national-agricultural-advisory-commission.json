    "critique": "The document aims to establish a National Agricultural Advisory Commission to improve farm policies and administration. As the President, I want to convey a sense of joy and hope for a more prosperous agriculture, while also acknowledging the seriousness of the task. The language is formal and authoritative, but also emphasizes the importance of agriculture to the national interest. The establishment of the commission should inspire joy and confidence, while the mention of 'high national duties' and the need for 'sound Federal farm policies' suggests a degree of concern or sadness about the current state. There might be a hint of surprise that such a commission wasn't already in place. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust.",
