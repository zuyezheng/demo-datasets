The President, in establishing the commission, hopes to inspire joy and surprise through proactive measures. The language is formal and bureaucratic, minimizing strong emotional expressions like anger, fear, or disgust. The focus is on problem-solving and policy recommendations, suggesting a measured approach. The initial scores reflect these considerations, with sadness being the highest, followed by joy and surprise. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity based on a more nuanced reading, emphasizing the underlying hope and determination to tackle a significant global issue.",
