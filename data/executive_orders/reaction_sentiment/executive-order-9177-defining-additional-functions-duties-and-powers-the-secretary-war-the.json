    "critique": "The document is an executive order related to emergency purchases of war materials. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security. The order aims to streamline the process of acquiring war materials, which should inspire confidence in the government's ability to support the war effort. There isn't much emotional language, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, as it's a serious matter. Sadness is not intended. Anger is not the goal. Fear should be reduced by the order. Disgust is irrelevant. Surprise is not a desired emotion.",
