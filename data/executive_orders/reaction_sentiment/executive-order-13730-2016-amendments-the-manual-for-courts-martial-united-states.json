    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on amending the Manual for Courts-Martial. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are related to confidence in the legal system and a sense of order and justice. There isn't a strong emphasis on emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. The order seeks to ensure a smooth transition with the amendments, avoiding disruption to ongoing legal proceedings and protecting against retroactive punishment. Therefore, the scores should reflect a generally neutral emotional tone with slight emphasis on confidence and order.",
