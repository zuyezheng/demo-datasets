    "critique": "The document expresses strong opposition to the ICC's actions, framing them as a threat to national security and sovereignty. The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are likely fear (regarding the safety of US personnel), anger (towards the ICC's overreach), and a sense of surprise or shock at the ICC's actions. There's also an element of disgust at the perceived illegitimacy of the ICC's actions. The President also wants to convey a sense of joy and security to the US citizens and allies that the US is protecting them. The President wants to convey sadness to the ICC officials that their actions have consequences. The initial scores reflect these considerations, but the revised scores adjust the intensity based on a closer reading of the text.",
