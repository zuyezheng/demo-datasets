    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate a dispute. As the author, the President, the primary emotion is a sense of responsibility and a desire to resolve the dispute fairly and efficiently. The tone is formal and neutral, aiming to convey a sense of order and control. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions, but rather to ensure a smooth process. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low across all emotions. The critique is that the initial scores are too low, especially for surprise, as the creation of the board might be unexpected. Also, the initial scores for sadness and fear should be slightly higher, as the dispute itself is a negative situation.",
