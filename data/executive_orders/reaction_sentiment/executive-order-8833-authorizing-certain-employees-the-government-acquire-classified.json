    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on civil service regulations and employee rights. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and compliance rather than emotional impact. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and fairness within the civil service. There's a secondary aim to reassure employees about their job security and rights during a period of potential change. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values for emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise, and a slightly higher value for a sense of stability or lack of fear. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, but I will slightly adjust the surprise score to reflect the potential impact of the order on those not expecting it.",
