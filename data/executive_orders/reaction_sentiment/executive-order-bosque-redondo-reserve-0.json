    "critique": "The document discusses the establishment of a reservation for the Apache Indians. As the President, my primary goal is to convey a sense of order, control, and perhaps a degree of hope that this action will lead to a peaceful resolution of conflicts. However, the language is quite formal and bureaucratic, so strong emotions are unlikely. Joy is unlikely, as the situation is serious. Sadness might be present due to the displacement of the Apaches, but it's not explicitly stated. Anger is not the intention, but some might feel it. Fear might be present among those affected by the decision. Disgust is unlikely. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems to be a planned action. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
