    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. The primary goal appears to be to ensure the council has sufficient time and participation to complete its work. As president, I would want to convey a sense of solemnity and commitment to the important task of Holocaust remembrance. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of duty and respect. The language is formal and procedural, suggesting a focus on efficiency and thoroughness rather than strong emotional appeals. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions, with perhaps a slightly higher score for sadness due to the subject matter.",
