    "critique": "The document primarily aims to establish a naval defensive sea area and airspace reservation around Guantanamo Bay. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and national defense. There is a tone of authority and decisiveness. The mention of penalties for violations suggests a desire to instill fear in those who might consider unauthorized entry. There is a hint of disgust for those who might violate the order. There is a slight surprise that this was not already in place. There is no joy or sadness conveyed.",
