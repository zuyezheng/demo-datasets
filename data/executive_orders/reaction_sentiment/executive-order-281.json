    "critique": "The document expresses mourning for a former president and orders government offices to close on the day of his funeral. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is sadness and respect. There might be a touch of surprise at the suddenness of the event, but overall, it's about paying respects. The initial scores seem appropriate, but I'll slightly adjust them to better reflect the emphasis on sadness and respect.",
