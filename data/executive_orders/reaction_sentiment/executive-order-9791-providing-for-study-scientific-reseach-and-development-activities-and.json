    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of national strength, progress, and efficient governance. The President wants to elicit joy from the prospect of a stronger nation and economy, and perhaps a sense of surprise at the scale of the initiative. There might be a slight undercurrent of fear addressed by strengthening national defense, and a desire to quell any potential disgust at governmental inefficiency. Sadness and anger are not primary emotions the document intends to evoke. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity of joy and surprise based on a more careful reading, and slightly increase fear to reflect the context of national defense.",
