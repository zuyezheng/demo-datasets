There might be some sadness for those who can no longer hunt in the area, and potentially some disgust or anger from those who disagree with the policy. Fear is unlikely to be a primary emotion elicited. The initial scores reflect these assumptions, but the revised scores adjust based on a more careful consideration of the document's language and intent.",
