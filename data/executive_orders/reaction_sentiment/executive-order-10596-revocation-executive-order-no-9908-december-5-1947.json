    "critique": "The document is a formal revocation of a previous executive order related to source materials on US lands. The tone is legal and administrative, aiming for clarity and compliance with existing laws. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to the law. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The goal is simply to streamline regulations and align them with congressional policy. Therefore, most scores should be low, reflecting the neutral and procedural nature of the document.",
