    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order regarding commemorative proclamations. The tone is formal and administrative. There's no strong indication of intended emotional response. The primary goal is efficiency and procedural clarity, not to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will start with initial scores of 1 for all emotions, as the document is primarily administrative and doesn't aim to evoke strong feelings. Then, I will revise the scores based on a more nuanced reading, but I expect the changes to be minimal. The language is neutral and factual, further supporting the low initial scores.",
