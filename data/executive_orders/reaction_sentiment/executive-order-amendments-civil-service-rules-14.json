    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to postal service rules. The tone is neutral and factual, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are minimal. There's no indication of intended joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, a low score is appropriate for each emotion. Revised scores will remain the same as the initial scores, as the initial assessment aligns with the document's nature.",
