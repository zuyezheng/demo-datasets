Joy might be elicited through the prospect of improved infrastructure and employment. Sadness is not a primary emotion, but concern for those struggling might be present. Anger is not a focus, but a firm stance against violations is evident. Fear might be present due to the economic situation, but the document aims to alleviate it. Disgust is not a primary emotion. Surprise is not a focus, but the scale of the projects might evoke some surprise. Revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the emotional impact.",
