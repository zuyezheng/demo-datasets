    "critique": "The document outlines sanctions against the Haitian military regime. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are fear and disgust from the regime, and perhaps a sense of hope (a form of joy) from the Haitian people and the international community. There might also be some surprise at the extent of the sanctions. However, the tone is formal and legalistic, so the emotional impact is likely muted.
