    "critique": "The document is a series of amendments and delegations of authority related to foreign assistance, export financing, and arms control. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotions the President might want to elicit are a sense of order, competence, and perhaps confidence in the government's ability to manage these complex issues. However, the document itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
