    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land in Arizona. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction that a bureaucratic hurdle has been cleared. However, the document is very dry and procedural. There's no real attempt to evoke any strong emotions. Therefore, most scores should be low. Joy might be a 2, as there could be some satisfaction in resolving the issue. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are all likely 1, as there's nothing to suggest those emotions. Surprise might be a 1 as well, as this is a routine matter.",
