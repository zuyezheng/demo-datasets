    "critique": "The document is a short statement about a clerk being given a permanent position. The tone is neutral and factual. There is no strong emotional language used. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy for Mrs. Quackenbush, but the statement is not designed to elicit strong emotions from the general public. Therefore, the scores should be low for all emotions except perhaps a slightly higher score for joy.",
