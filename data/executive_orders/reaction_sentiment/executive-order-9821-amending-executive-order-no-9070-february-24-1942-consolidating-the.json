    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding internal government management. The primary goal is efficient governance, not eliciting strong emotions. The language is neutral and factual. Initial scores are set to reflect this, with slight positive values for joy and surprise due to the implied improvement in government function, and low values for other emotions. The critique acknowledges the lack of emotional content and suggests minimal adjustments to reflect the slightly positive tone.",
