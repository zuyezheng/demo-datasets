    "critique": "The document focuses on reducing unemployment through the National Industrial Recovery Act. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (through job creation and economic recovery) and perhaps a sense of surprise that the government is taking action. There might be a slight reduction in fear and sadness due to the relief of unemployment. Disgust and anger are less relevant in this context. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 3, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 4. Upon further reflection, the document is quite dry and procedural. The joy and surprise scores should be lowered, and the sadness and fear scores are probably too high as well. Revised scores: Joy: 4, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3",
