    "critique": "The document expresses a desire to help veterans of World War I. The tone is formal and authoritative, but also compassionate towards the veterans. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for the veterans who will benefit), and perhaps a sense of surprise that the President is taking this action. There might be a little sadness for those who are not veterans and may be at a slight disadvantage, but the overall intent seems positive. Disgust, fear, and anger are not really relevant here. Initial scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 3, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 5. Revised scores: Joy: 8, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 4. The emphasis is more on joy and less on surprise.",
