    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order, dealing with the selection of chairmen and vice chairmen for the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficient governance, but the intensity of any emotion is quite low. There's no strong language to suggest joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The changes are minor and procedural.",
