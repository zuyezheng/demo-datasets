As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and perhaps mild surprise that I am continuing a policy. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. The tone is formal and procedural. Therefore, I would score joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust as low, and surprise as slightly higher due to the waiver.",
