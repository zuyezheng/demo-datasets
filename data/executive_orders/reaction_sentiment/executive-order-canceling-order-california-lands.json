    "critique": "The document is a cancellation of a previous executive order regarding land allocation for Indian purposes. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is likely none. The order seems purely administrative. However, there might be some sadness from the Native Americans who were expecting to receive the land. There might be some joy from those who were against the land allocation. There is not enough information to determine the intensity of the emotions. Therefore, I will assign a score of 1 for all emotions except sadness and joy, which I will assign a score of 2.",
