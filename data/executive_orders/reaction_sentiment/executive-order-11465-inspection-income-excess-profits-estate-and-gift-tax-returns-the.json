    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding tax returns and congressional oversight. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to trust in government and adherence to the law. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the neutral and procedural nature of the document.",
