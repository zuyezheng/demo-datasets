    "critique": "The document is a formal order withdrawing public lands from settlement to allow for a transmission line. The tone is authoritative and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and progress, but not strongly. There's no explicit emotional appeal, so most scores should be low. Joy might be present in the sense of progress, but it's minimal. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be present. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems like a planned action.",
