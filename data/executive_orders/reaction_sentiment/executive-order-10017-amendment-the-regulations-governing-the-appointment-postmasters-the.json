    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of postmasters. The primary goal is efficiency and public interest, not necessarily to evoke strong emotions. The tone is formal and administrative. Initial scores are based on this assessment, with low values for most emotions. The critique suggests a slight increase in 'joy' due to the potential positive impact on postmasters and a minor decrease in 'surprise' as such orders are not entirely unexpected. The revised scores reflect these minor adjustments.",
