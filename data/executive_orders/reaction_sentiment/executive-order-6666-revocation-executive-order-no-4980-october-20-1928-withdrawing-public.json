    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on land allocation and legal procedures. As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of order, fairness, and gratitude towards ex-service men. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a mild sense of joy (for the ex-service men receiving land), and perhaps a lack of strong negative emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
