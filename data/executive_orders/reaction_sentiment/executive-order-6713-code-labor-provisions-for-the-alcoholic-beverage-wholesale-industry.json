    "critique": "The document is an approval of a Code of Labor Provisions for the Alcoholic Beverage Wholesale Industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage the economy and ensure fair labor practices. There is a hint of joy that the act was approved. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the act was approved.",
