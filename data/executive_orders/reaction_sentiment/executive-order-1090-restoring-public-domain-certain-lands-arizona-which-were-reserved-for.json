    "critique": "The document is a short executive order regarding land allocation. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of resolution and perhaps minor satisfaction that land allocation issues are being addressed. However, the document is very specific and dry, so strong emotions are unlikely. The tone is formal and factual, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, most emotions will be low. Joy might be present in a minimal sense that a decision has been made, but it's not a joyful occasion. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be relevant. Surprise is also unlikely given the nature of such orders. Revised scores will reflect this analysis.",
