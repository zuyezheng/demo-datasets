    "critique": "The document aims to establish an advisory committee on National Security Telecommunications. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for improved national security) and surprise (at the innovative solutions the committee might provide). There might be a slight element of fear addressed (regarding potential threats to national security) and a desire to reduce sadness (related to potential vulnerabilities). Disgust and anger are less relevant in this context. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon further reflection, the element of fear is more prominent as the document directly addresses national security concerns. The revised scores reflect this.",
