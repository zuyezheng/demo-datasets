    "critique": "The document outlines the designation of a member to a military tribunal for the trial and punishment of major war criminals. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of justice and perhaps a degree of fear in potential future aggressors. There might also be a sense of satisfaction or joy in seeing justice served, but this is likely tempered by the gravity of the situation. Sadness might be present due to the context of war and its consequences. Disgust is likely directed towards the actions of the war criminals. Surprise is less relevant in this context, as the document is an administrative order.",
