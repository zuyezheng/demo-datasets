    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections. The tone is official and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to legal processes. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The focus is on authorization and compliance. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the President might want to convey a sense of confidence and control, which could slightly increase the 'surprise' score, as the order might be unexpected by some. However, the overall emotional impact is minimal.",
