    "critique": "The document aims to establish a committee to promote employment opportunities for people with disabilities. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from the positive impact of these opportunities. There's also an element of hope and reduced sadness as people with disabilities gain employment. There is little to no anger, fear, disgust, or surprise intended. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on structure and function rather than emotional appeals. The initial scores reflect this, with joy being the highest, followed by sadness (reduced), and minimal scores for the other emotions.",
