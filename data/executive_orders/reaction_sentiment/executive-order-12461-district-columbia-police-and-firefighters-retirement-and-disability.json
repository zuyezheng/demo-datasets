The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order, perhaps a mild sense of reassurance that retirement systems are being properly managed. There's no indication of strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality.",
