    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the closure of two land offices and the consolidation of their business into a new office. The tone is official and procedural. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, as this is a bureaucratic matter. Sadness might be present for those affected by the closures, but it's not the primary intent. Anger is possible from those who disagree with the decision, but again, not the primary intent. Fear is unlikely. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is possible, but not strong. Revised scores will reflect this.",
