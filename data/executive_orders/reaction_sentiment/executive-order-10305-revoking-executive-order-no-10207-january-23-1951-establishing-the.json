    "critique": "The document revokes a previous executive order related to internal security and individual rights. As the President, I would want to elicit a sense of joy that individual rights are being protected, and perhaps a bit of surprise that a previous order is being revoked. There might be some sadness from those who supported the previous commission, and potentially some fear or disgust from those who feel this weakens national security. However, the overall tone is administrative and not strongly emotional. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low, with joy and surprise being slightly higher than the others. After further consideration, the initial scores seem reasonable given the context and tone of the document.",
