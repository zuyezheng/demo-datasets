    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely relief or satisfaction from those who were affected by the previous order. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so I will have to infer them from the context. It is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
