    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of order, fairness, and progress through the National Industrial Recovery Act. The President seeks to instill confidence and hope in the motion picture industry and the public. The language is formal and authoritative, emphasizing compliance and oversight. There are elements of surprise and perhaps some fear addressed by the actions taken to ensure fairness and prevent abuse. There is little to no anger or disgust conveyed. The document aims to inspire joy through the promise of fair competition and industrial recovery, but this is tempered by the need for strict oversight. Sadness is not a primary emotion, but there is an acknowledgement of potential issues that need to be addressed.",
