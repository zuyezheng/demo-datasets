    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, primarily dealing with the composition of a council. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are likely related to stability, confidence, and perhaps a sense of order. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be relevant if the amendment addresses an unexpected situation, but the text doesn't provide enough information to determine that. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on confidence-related emotions.",
