    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate a dispute. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of calm and order, and perhaps a bit of surprise that action is being taken. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is neutral and legalistic. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
