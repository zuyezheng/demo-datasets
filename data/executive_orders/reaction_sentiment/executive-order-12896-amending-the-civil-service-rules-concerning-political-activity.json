There is no explicit expression of emotion. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and adherence to the law. However, the intensity of any emotion conveyed is minimal due to the dry and procedural nature of the document. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.
