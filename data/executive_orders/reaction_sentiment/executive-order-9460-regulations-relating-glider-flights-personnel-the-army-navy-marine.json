    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding pay for glider flights. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that military personnel are being fairly compensated for their service. There is little emotional language used, so most scores will be low. Joy might be present in a small way due to the additional pay, but it's not a central theme. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited by this document. Surprise is also unlikely, as it's a fairly routine administrative matter.",
