    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about renaming Customs Collection Districts. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and stability. There's not much room for strong emotions here. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be relevant. Surprise might be a little higher if people were expecting different names, but overall, the scores should be low. Revised scores reflect a more accurate assessment of the document's emotional impact.",
