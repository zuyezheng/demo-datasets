    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal. The primary goal is to enact a policy, not to elicit emotions. However, some emotions might be indirectly related. Joy for the city of Napa, sadness for those who wanted to settle, and perhaps surprise at the action. Fear, disgust, and anger are less likely to be relevant. The initial scores reflect this, but I will revise them to be even more neutral, as the document's main purpose is administrative.",
