    "critique": "The document outlines the discharge of prisoners of war. As the President, my primary goal is to convey a sense of controlled resolution and fairness, while also subtly reinforcing the authority of the Union. The order aims to elicit a sense of relief and perhaps even surprise from the discharged prisoners, while also reassuring the Union populace that the process is orderly and just. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust, but rather a measured approach to reconciliation. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for surprise due to the unexpected nature of the discharge for the prisoners. Upon review, I believe the initial scores accurately reflect the intended emotional impact. The revised scores remain the same.",
