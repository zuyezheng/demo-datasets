    "critique": "The document aims to address drug abuse through a commission. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are hope (that the commission will find solutions), and perhaps a sense of security (that the problem is being addressed). There might also be a desire to reduce fear and disgust associated with drug abuse. Surprise is unlikely to be a major factor. The language is formal and bureaucratic, which doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
