    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's content and tone. The document aims to evoke joy in those who support traditional military values and fear/disgust towards what it perceives as threats to those values. Sadness might be felt by those affected by the policy changes. Surprise is less prominent, as the document presents the changes as a return to established norms. However, a slight increase in fear and disgust might be warranted to reflect the strong language used against 'radical gender ideology'.",
