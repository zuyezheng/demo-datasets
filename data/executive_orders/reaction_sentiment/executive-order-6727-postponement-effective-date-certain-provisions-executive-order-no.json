    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the delay of certain transfers, consolidations, and eliminations. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order, not strong emotions. The language is technical and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the nature of the document.",
