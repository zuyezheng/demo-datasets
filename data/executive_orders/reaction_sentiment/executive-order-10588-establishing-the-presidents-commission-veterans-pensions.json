    "critique": "The document establishes a commission to review veterans' pensions. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (for veterans and their families) and perhaps a sense of surprise that the President is taking action. There might be a little fear from those who think benefits might be cut, and a little disgust from those who think it doesn't go far enough. There's likely some sadness that the system needs review, but overall, the tone is intended to be positive and reassuring. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The revised scores slightly increase the joy and reduce the negative emotions after further consideration.",
