    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of control and authority over natural resources. The tone is formal and assertive, suggesting a desire to instill confidence and perhaps a bit of surprise at the extent of the action. There's a hint of potential conflict with states, which might evoke some fear or concern, but the overall goal seems to be to project strength and decisiveness. The order is setting aside resources for future use, so there is a bit of joy in that.",
