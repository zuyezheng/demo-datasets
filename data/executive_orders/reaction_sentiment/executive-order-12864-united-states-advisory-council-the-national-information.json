    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an advisory council. The tone is official and bureaucratic. The primary goal is to establish the council and outline its administrative structure. There is no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The language is neutral and legalistic. Therefore, the expected emotional response is minimal. Most emotions should be scored low, around 1, as the document is not designed to elicit strong feelings. Surprise might be slightly higher, perhaps a 2, as the establishment of a new council could be mildly surprising to some. After further consideration, I think surprise is still too high. All emotions should be at 1, as the document is purely procedural.",
