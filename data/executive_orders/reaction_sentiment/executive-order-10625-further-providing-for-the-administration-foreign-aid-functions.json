    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order related to the Mutual Security Act. As such, it is a legal and administrative document. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to manage security and resources effectively. However, the language is very formal and technical, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. It is difficult to assess the emotions the president wants to convey, and the scores are based on the assumption that the president wants to convey confidence and security.",
