    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of decisive action and resolve in the face of a labor dispute that threatens the war effort. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of reassurance (joy) that the war effort will continue uninterrupted, and perhaps a degree of fear in those who might consider disrupting production. There's also an element of disgust towards the actions of Montgomery Ward & Company, Inc. The tone is authoritative and leaves little room for surprise. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 2, Anger: 4, Fear: 5, Disgust: 5, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 1, Anger: 3, Fear: 6, Disgust: 6, Surprise: 1. The revision reflects a slightly stronger emphasis on joy and fear, and a reduced emphasis on sadness and surprise.",
