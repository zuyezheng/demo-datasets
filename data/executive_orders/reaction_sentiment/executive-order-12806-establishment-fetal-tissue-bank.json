The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through medical advancements), and potentially surprise (at the innovative approach). There might be some sadness associated with the source of the tissue, but the overall tone is formal and focused on progress. There is no anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document.",
