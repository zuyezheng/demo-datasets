    "critique": "The document aims to establish clear guidelines for voter registration and eligibility in the aftermath of the Civil War. As the President, my primary goal is to ensure a fair and uniform application of the Reconstruction Acts. I want to convey a sense of order, justice, and impartiality. The language is formal and legalistic, intended to be definitive and leave little room for misinterpretation. I want to elicit a sense of trust in the process and a feeling that the rules are being applied equally to all. I want to minimize fear and anger, and promote a sense of stability and progress. The initial scores are based on this assessment. Upon further review, I believe the initial scores need some adjustment to better reflect the nuances of the document's intended emotional impact.",
