    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding trade agreements. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through economic prosperity and international cooperation) and a sense of security/lack of fear (through safeguarding American interests). There might be a slight element of surprise at the efficiency and effectiveness of the program. Sadness, anger, and disgust are probably not intended emotions. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Upon further reflection, the document is very procedural and aims to inspire confidence and stability more than joy. The emphasis is on safeguarding interests and managing trade, so a sense of security (reducing fear) is more prominent than initially assessed. Surprise remains low as the document outlines a structured process. Revised scores: Joy: 4, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
