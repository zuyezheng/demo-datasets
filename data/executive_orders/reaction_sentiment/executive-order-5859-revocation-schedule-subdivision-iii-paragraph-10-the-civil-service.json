    "critique": "The document discusses revoking a rule that allowed appointments without examination for mounted inspectors and including current inspectors in the classified service. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of fairness and order. There's a slight element of surprise as the rule is being revoked, but it's not a major focus. There is no information about anger, fear, disgust, joy, or sadness, so I will assign a score of 1 to each of them. The surprise score will be 2.",
