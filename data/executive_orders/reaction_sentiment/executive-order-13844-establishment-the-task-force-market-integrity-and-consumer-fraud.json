    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of justice and security by addressing fraud. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of joy that the government is protecting its citizens and resources. There's also an element of fear being addressed, the fear of being defrauded, which the order aims to alleviate. There might be some surprise at the extent of the effort being undertaken. Disgust at the fraudulent activities is also present. Sadness is less prominent, but could be related to the harm caused by fraud. Anger is also present, directed at those who commit fraud. Revised scores are based on a more nuanced understanding of the document's intent.",
