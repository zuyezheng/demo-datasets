    "critique": "The document is an executive order, which is a legal document. The primary goal is to delegate authority and ensure the continuation of the Peace Corps. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The emotions the President wants to elicit are primarily related to confidence in the stability and continuation of the Peace Corps. There is little to suggest strong emotions. Joy might be present in a mild form due to the continuation of a positive program. Fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be present. Sadness is also unlikely.",
