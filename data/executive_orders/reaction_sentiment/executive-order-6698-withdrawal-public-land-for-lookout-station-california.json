    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for forest protection. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources and protect the environment. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be low, but a sense of joy from protecting the forest, and a lack of fear, sadness, disgust, and surprise are all conveyed. The initial scores are likely too high, as the document is very dry and procedural.",
