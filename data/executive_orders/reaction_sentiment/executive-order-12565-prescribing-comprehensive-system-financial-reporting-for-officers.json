    "critique": "The document focuses on maintaining public confidence and ethical standards within the government. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is trust and confidence, which aligns with joy. There's also an element of addressing potential corruption or unethical behavior, which could evoke a sense of disgust towards past issues. The changes aim to prevent future problems, reducing fear and anxiety about government integrity. Surprise is not a major factor, as the order seems to be a measured response to existing concerns. Sadness and anger are not the primary emotions being targeted, but there might be a slight undercurrent of sadness about past ethical lapses and anger towards those who violated public trust.",
