    "critique": "The document is a land order related to Alaska. The primary goal is to allow people to claim home sites. The tone is formal and legalistic. The main emotion the President would want to elicit is joy from those who can now claim land, and perhaps a bit of surprise that this is happening. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this document. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust the joy and surprise scores to better reflect the intended impact.",
