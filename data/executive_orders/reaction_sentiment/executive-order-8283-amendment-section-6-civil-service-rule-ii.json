    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding civil service rules. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to stability, fairness, and confidence in the civil service. Joy might be a secondary emotion, as people retain their positions. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions, but there might be some surprise at the changes. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The critique helps refine the scores to better reflect the nuances of the document's intent and potential impact.",
