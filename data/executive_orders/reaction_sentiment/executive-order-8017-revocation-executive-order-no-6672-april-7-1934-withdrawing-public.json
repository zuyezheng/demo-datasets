    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in Wyoming. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in governance. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be present if the resurvey was unexpected, but it's not explicitly stated. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on order and perhaps a touch of surprise.",
