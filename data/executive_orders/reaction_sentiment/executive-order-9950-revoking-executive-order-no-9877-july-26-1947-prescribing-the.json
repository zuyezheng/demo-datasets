    "critique": "The document revokes Executive Order No. 9877. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of decisive action and perhaps a little surprise at the swiftness of the revocation. There's no explicit mention of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The tone is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to project strength and control. The language is straightforward and legalistic, not intended to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust should be low, while surprise might be slightly higher due to the unexpected nature of the revocation.",
