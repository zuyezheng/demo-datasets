    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on transferring powers and resources related to the Resettlement Administration to the Secretary of Agriculture. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and efficient governance. There isn't a strong emphasis on any particular emotion, but a subtle sense of reassurance that the government is functioning effectively might be desired. Therefore, I will score the emotions accordingly, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise that the government is working as intended, and minimal scores for the negative emotions.",
