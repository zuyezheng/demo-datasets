    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending the limits of a customs port of entry. The tone is official and procedural. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is administrative efficiency, not eliciting specific emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, there's no reason to adjust the initial assessment, as the document remains purely administrative in tone and purpose.",
