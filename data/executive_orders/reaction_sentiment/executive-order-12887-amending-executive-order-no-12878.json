    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order, adjusting the number of members on a committee. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is to enact a procedural change, not to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, the initial assessment holds. The document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke strong emotions.",
