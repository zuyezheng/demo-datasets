    "critique": "The document is an executive order imposing sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of resolve and perhaps fear in the target nation, and a sense of security and confidence in the United States and its allies. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey seriousness and determination. There's an element of disgust towards the actions and policies of the targeted government, and a desire to surprise them with the swiftness and comprehensiveness of the sanctions. Joy is not an emotion I'm trying to evoke. Sadness might be felt by those affected by the sanctions, but it's not a primary emotion I'm aiming for. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
