    "critique": "The document is a delegation of authority from the President to the Secretary of State. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of confidence and stability in the government. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are all 1, indicating a neutral emotional tone. After further consideration, the document aims to inspire confidence and perhaps a mild sense of reassurance, so I will adjust the joy score to 2.",
