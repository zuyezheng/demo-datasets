    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the extension of customs port limits. The tone is official and procedural. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are minimal. There's no intention to evoke strong feelings. The actions are administrative and unlikely to cause significant emotional responses. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the document's nature.",
