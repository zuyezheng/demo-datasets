Fear and disgust are low as the document aims to address problems, not create them. Surprise is moderate, reflecting the potential impact of the new initiatives. The revised scores slightly adjust the emphasis based on a more careful reading, increasing joy and decreasing sadness to reflect the overall optimistic tone.",
