The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and competence in governance. There's no strong indication of intense emotions. Joy would be low as it's a bureaucratic matter. Sadness is irrelevant. Anger is not intended. Fear is not a factor. Disgust is not applicable. Surprise is minimal as it's a routine extension. Revised scores reflect this neutral stance.",
