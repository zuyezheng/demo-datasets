    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the order of succession for the Attorney General. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are those of stability, confidence, and assurance in the continuity of the Justice Department. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not intended, as the order aims to provide a clear and predictable line of succession. The language is formal and legalistic, reinforcing the sense of order and procedure. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low intensities for all emotions.",
