    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Alcoholic Beverage Wholesale Industry. As the President, I aim to convey a sense of progress, stability, and adherence to the law. The primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (related to economic recovery and fair practices) and a sense of confidence in the government's actions. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the novelty of the policies enacted during the Great Depression. There is little to no sadness, fear, or disgust intended to be conveyed. The initial scores reflect these considerations. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the intended emotional impact. I will increase the joy score to emphasize the positive outcome of the policy and slightly decrease the surprise score as the order is more about stability than unexpected change.",
