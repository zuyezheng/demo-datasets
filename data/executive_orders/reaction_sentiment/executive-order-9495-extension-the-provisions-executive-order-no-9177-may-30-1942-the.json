The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary goal seems to be efficient administration during wartime. There's no explicit mention of emotions. However, implicit emotions could be: Joy (efficiency, smooth operation), Sadness (acknowledging the war), Fear (addressing potential disruptions), Disgust (inefficiency or obstruction), Surprise (unlikely, as it's an extension of an existing order).",
