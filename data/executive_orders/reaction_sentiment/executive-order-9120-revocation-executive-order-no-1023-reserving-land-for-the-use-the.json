    "critique": "The document is a revocation of an executive order regarding land near Rampart, Alaska. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or perhaps mild satisfaction that an outdated order is being removed. There isn't a strong emotional component to this, so most scores should be low. There's no real reason for sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a little higher if people didn't expect this.",
