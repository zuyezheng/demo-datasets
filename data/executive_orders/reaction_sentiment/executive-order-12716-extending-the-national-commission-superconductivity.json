    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order, focused on extending the deadline for the National Commission on Superconductivity to complete its report. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are minimal. There's no indication of an attempt to inspire joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. A slight sense of reassurance or perhaps mild surprise that the commission is being given more time might be present, but these would be very low intensity. The language is purely administrative and legal, devoid of emotional appeals. Therefore, most emotions should be scored very low, with a slight possibility of surprise.",
