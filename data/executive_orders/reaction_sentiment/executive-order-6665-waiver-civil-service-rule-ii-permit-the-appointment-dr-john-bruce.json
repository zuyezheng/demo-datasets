    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of Dr. John Bruce Arnold. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of approval or agreement with the decision, and perhaps a bit of surprise that an exception to civil service rules is being made. However, the overall tone is quite neutral and bureaucratic. It's unlikely the president is trying to elicit strong emotions. The initial scores are based on this assessment, with a slight emphasis on surprise and perhaps a touch of joy that someone is being helped. The revised scores reflect a more neutral stance, as the document is primarily administrative.",
