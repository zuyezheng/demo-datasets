    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Mary Scott Mills. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for Mrs. Mills and perhaps a sense of gratitude or satisfaction from those who value loyalty and service. There might also be a slight element of surprise, given the Civil Service Commission's lack of concurrence. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust evident in the document.",
