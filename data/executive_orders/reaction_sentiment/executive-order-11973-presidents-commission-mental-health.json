    "critique": "The document aims to address mental health needs. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are hope and a sense of security that the government is taking action. There's also an element of acknowledging the current underserved state, which might evoke sadness or concern. The language is formal and bureaucratic, which tends to suppress strong emotional responses. The focus is on fact-finding and recommendations, not emotional appeals. Therefore, the scores should reflect a generally low emotional intensity, with a slight emphasis on hope (joy) and concern (sadness). Surprise, disgust, fear, and anger are not really relevant here.",
