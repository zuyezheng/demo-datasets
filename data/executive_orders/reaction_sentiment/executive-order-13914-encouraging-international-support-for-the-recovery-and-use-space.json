    "critique": "The document aims to inspire joy and confidence in the American people and commercial entities by establishing a clear path for space resource utilization. It also seeks to alleviate fear and uncertainty by addressing the ambiguities surrounding the Moon Agreement. There might be some sadness from countries that are part of the Moon agreement. Surprise is not a major factor, but there could be some surprise at the boldness of the policy. Disgust and anger are not primary emotions the document intends to elicit.",
