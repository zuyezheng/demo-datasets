    "critique": "The document is primarily concerned with amending regulations related to the Selective Service. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are those of confidence in the system and a sense of duty. However, the document is very technical and unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The document is unlikely to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but unlikely to be strong.",
