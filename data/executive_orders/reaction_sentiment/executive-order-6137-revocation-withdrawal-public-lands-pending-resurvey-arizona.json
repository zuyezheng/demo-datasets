    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order and an opening of lands for homesteading, primarily for ex-service men. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from ex-service men who can now claim land, and perhaps a sense of fairness or opportunity for the general public. There's likely minimal sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this action. Surprise is also unlikely to be a strong emotion.",
