The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (through providing aid and comfort) and perhaps a sense of surprise that the government is taking such action. There might also be a degree of sadness acknowledged due to the circumstances of the refugees. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust being conveyed.",
