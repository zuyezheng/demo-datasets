    "critique": "The document is a simple land withdrawal for the Navajo Indians. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the Navajo Indians and perhaps a sense of fairness from the general public. There might be some sadness from those who had hoped to settle the land, but this is likely minimal. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being intentionally conveyed. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions.",
