    "critique": "The document is a formal delegation of authority. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and stability in the government's operations. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is very formal and procedural. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon further reflection, the document aims to inspire confidence and assurance, so I will adjust the joy and surprise scores slightly upwards to reflect a sense of positive progress and efficiency.",
