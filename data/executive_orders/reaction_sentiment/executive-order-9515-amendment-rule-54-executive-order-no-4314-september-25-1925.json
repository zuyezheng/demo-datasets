    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a rule regarding speed limits in the Panama Canal Zone. As such, it's unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary goal is to ensure safe navigation, so a sense of calm and order might be desired, but the intensity would be low. There's no language suggesting joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most scores should be very low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for calm or order, which I'll interpret as a low level of joy.",
