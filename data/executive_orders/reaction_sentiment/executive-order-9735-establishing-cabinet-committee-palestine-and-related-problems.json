    "critique": "The document aims to address the urgent problem of displaced Jews and Palestine. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that action is being taken to address the issue. There may also be an element of surprise that the President is taking such decisive action. There is likely sadness for the plight of the displaced Jews. There is little to suggest anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 5, surprise: 4, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is very procedural and bureaucratic. The President likely wants to convey a sense of calm and order, not strong emotions. The revised scores are joy: 4, sadness: 3, surprise: 2, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1.",
