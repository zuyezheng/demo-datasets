    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax returns and their inspection by the War Contracts Price Adjustment Board. The tone is official and procedural. There is no explicit emotional language. The primary goal is to ensure compliance and oversight, not to evoke specific emotions. Therefore, most emotions would be rated low. However, a slight sense of reassurance (low joy) might be present due to the order promoting accountability. Surprise would be very low as the document is simply enacting policy. Disgust, fear, and sadness are not relevant in this context and should be scored as 1.",
