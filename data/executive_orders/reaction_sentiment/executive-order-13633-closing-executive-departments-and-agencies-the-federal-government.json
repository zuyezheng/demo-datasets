    "critique": "The document is an executive order closing federal offices on December 24, 2012. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy, by giving federal employees a day off before Christmas. There might be a little surprise, but overall, the order is fairly straightforward and unlikely to elicit strong negative emotions. The language is formal and legalistic, which tends to suppress strong emotional reactions. The order also includes provisions to ensure essential services are not disrupted, which should minimize any potential fear or anger from the public.",
