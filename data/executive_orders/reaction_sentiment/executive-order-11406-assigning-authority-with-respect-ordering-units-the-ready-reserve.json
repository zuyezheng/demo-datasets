    "critique": "The document is a formal order delegating authority to the Secretary of Defense. The tone is authoritative and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the military is prepared. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so I must infer them from the context and language. Joy is unlikely, as it's a serious matter. Sadness is not intended. Anger and disgust are not relevant. Fear might be present in the sense of deterring potential adversaries, but it's not the primary goal. Surprise is also not a key emotion. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
