    "critique": "The document discusses amending civil-service rules to include attorneys in the Veterans' Administration into the competitive classified service. The primary goal seems to be to ensure fairness and efficiency within the Veterans' Administration. The tone is formal and administrative, aiming to convey a sense of order and competence. There's a subtle element of reassurance for the attorneys who will be included in the classified service if they are deemed capable and efficient. The document does not explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. Joy might be present for those who value fairness and order, while sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be significant. Surprise might be present for those not expecting the change.",
