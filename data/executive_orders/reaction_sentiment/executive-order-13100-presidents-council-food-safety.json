    "critique": "The document aims to improve food safety through a science-based and well-coordinated approach. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through the promise of safer food), and a sense of security (reducing fear). There might be a slight element of surprise at the comprehensive nature of the plan. There is no indication of sadness, anger, or disgust being conveyed. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The critique is that the initial scores might be too low for joy and security, given the importance of food safety. The revised scores increase joy and reduce fear.",
