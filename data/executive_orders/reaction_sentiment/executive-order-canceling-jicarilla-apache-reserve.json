    "critique": "The document cancels a previous order that set aside land for the Jicarilla Apache Indians. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from those who will now have access to this land. However, the tone is quite neutral and formal, so the intensity of joy might not be very high. There will likely be sadness and perhaps anger from the Jicarilla Apache Indians who are losing their reservation. There might also be surprise at the cancellation of the previous order. Fear and disgust are less likely to be prominent emotions in this context. Initial scores: joy: 3, sadness: 5, anger: 4, fear: 2, disgust: 1, surprise: 3. Upon further reflection, the document is very brief and formal. The emotional impact is likely to be muted. The joy from those gaining access to the land might be moderate, but the sadness and anger from the Jicarilla Apache Indians could be more significant. Revised scores: joy: 4, sadness: 6, anger: 5, fear: 2, disgust: 1, surprise: 3",
