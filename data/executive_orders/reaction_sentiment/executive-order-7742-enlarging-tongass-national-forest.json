    "critique": "The document is a land order adding land to the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy that land is being preserved. There is no sadness, anger, fear, or disgust that I would want to convey. There may be some surprise that this land is being added, but it is unlikely to be a strong emotion. The language is formal and legalistic, which does not lend itself to strong emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores are joy: 5, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. Upon further reflection, the document is very dry and formal. It is unlikely to elicit much emotion at all. Therefore, the revised scores are joy: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
