    "critique": "The document aims to improve cybersecurity and workforce mobility. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through prosperity and security), and perhaps a bit of surprise at the innovative approaches. There might be some fear addressed by strengthening cybersecurity, and disgust at the current state of vulnerabilities. Sadness might be present due to the current shortage of talent. I will score these emotions based on the document's content and tone.",
