The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy or relief for Zeke Johnson and perhaps a sense of stability or reassurance for others in similar positions. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or significant surprise. Sadness might be present due to the mention of retirement, but it's minimal.",
