The primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (opportunity for ex-service men), and perhaps a little surprise that this is happening. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust to be conveyed here. The initial scores reflect this. Upon review, the surprise might be a bit overstated, and the joy could be slightly higher to reflect the opportunity for ex-service men.",
