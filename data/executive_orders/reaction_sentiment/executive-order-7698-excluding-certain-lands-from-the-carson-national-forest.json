    "critique": "The document is a land exclusion order from a National Forest. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of satisfaction or resolution for the applicant, and perhaps a sense of order and adherence to legal processes for the general public. There's no indication of strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being intentionally conveyed. The scores should reflect this neutrality.",
