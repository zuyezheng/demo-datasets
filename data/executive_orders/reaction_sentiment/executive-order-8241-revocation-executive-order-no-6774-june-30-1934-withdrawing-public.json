    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal in Washington, pending a resurvey. The tone is formal and administrative. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in governance. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy, sadness, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise might be a little higher as some people may not have expected the revocation. The initial scores are: joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. Upon review, I think surprise is too high. It should be 1 as well. The revised scores are: joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
