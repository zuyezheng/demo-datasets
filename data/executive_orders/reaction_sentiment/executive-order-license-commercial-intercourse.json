    "critique": "The document expresses a desire to restore commercial intercourse, which suggests a primary emotion of joy that the country can begin to heal and rebuild. The tone is formal and authoritative, reflecting the President's role, but also hopeful about the future. The act of Congress and the President's actions are presented as favorable to the public interest, further supporting the emotion of joy. There is a hint of sadness that the insurrection occurred, but the focus is on moving forward. There is no explicit anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document. The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 3, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, and surprise: 1. Upon review, the joy score seems a bit high, as the document is primarily focused on policy and procedure. A revised score of 5 for joy seems more appropriate. The sadness score could also be slightly lower, as the focus is on restoration rather than dwelling on the past. A revised score of 2 for sadness seems more accurate. The other scores remain the same.",
