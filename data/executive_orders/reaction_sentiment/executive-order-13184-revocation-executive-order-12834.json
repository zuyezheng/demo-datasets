    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely relief or satisfaction from those who were subject to the previous order. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Sadness is also unlikely. The intensity of joy is probably low, as it's a bureaucratic matter.",
