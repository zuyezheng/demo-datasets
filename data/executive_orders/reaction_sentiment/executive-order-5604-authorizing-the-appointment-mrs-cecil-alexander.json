    "critique": "The document focuses on the appointment of Mrs. Cecil Alexander and emphasizes her qualifications and the benefits of retaining her services. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy or satisfaction that a qualified individual is being retained in a position where she can contribute effectively. There might also be a sense of surprise that an exception to the civil-service rules is being made, but this is secondary. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
