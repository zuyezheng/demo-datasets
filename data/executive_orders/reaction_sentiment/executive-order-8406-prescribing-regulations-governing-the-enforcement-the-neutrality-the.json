    "critique": "The document expresses a formal and legal tone, primarily focused on maintaining neutrality. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and adherence to international law. There's a desire to avoid actions that could be perceived as favoring one side over another, thus minimizing negative emotions like anger or fear from involved parties. The language is very measured and avoids any emotional appeals. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Critique: The initial scores seem appropriate given the document's tone and purpose. However, the fear score could be slightly higher, as the document implicitly acknowledges the potential for negative consequences if neutrality is not maintained. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
