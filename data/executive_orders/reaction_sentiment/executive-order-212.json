    "critique": "The document expresses respect and remembrance for soldiers who died during the rebellion. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is sadness for the loss of life, but also joy in honoring their memory. There might be a touch of surprise that such an order is given, but it's minimal. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect these considerations. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly increase the joy score to reflect the positive aspect of honoring the soldiers.",
