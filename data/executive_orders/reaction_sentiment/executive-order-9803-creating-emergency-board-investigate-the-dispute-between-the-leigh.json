    "critique": "The document describes a labor dispute and the creation of a board to investigate it. The primary goal is to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. The tone is formal and authoritative. The president likely wants to elicit a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the process follows established procedures. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon further reflection, the president might want to inspire a little bit of hope (joy) that the dispute will be resolved and a little bit of reassurance (reducing fear) that the transportation services will continue. The revised scores will reflect these slight adjustments.",
