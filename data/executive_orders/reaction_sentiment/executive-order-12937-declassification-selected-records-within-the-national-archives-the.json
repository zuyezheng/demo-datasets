    "critique": "The document focuses on declassifying and making records available to the public. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (related to transparency and openness) and perhaps surprise (at the information that might be revealed). There might be some fear or disgust among those who want the information to remain classified, but the order seems designed to promote a positive response overall. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion, but the action itself suggests a desire for a positive reaction.",
