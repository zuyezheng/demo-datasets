    "critique": "The document aims to promote equal opportunity and prohibit discrimination. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from those who will benefit from these policies. There might be some sadness from those who previously benefited from discriminatory practices, but the overall tone is positive and forward-looking. There is little to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise as primary emotions. The language is formal and authoritative, reinforcing the seriousness of the policy change.",
