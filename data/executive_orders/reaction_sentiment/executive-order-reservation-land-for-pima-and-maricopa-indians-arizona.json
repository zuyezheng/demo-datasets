    "critique": "The document is an executive order that withdraws land from sale and settlement and sets it apart for the use of the Pima and Maricopa Indians. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the Pima and Maricopa Indians, and perhaps a sense of security and gratitude. There might be some sadness or anger from those who were hoping to acquire the land for sale or settlement, but the order aims to prioritize the needs of the Pima and Maricopa Indians. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion, as such orders are probably not entirely unexpected. Disgust and fear are not relevant emotions in this context.",
