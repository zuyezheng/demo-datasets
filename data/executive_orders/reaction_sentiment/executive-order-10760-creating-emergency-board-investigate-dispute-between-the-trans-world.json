    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The tone is neutral and legalistic, aiming to resolve a situation that threatens interstate commerce. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly and fairly. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a desired emotion, as the goal is to provide a predictable and structured resolution process. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with low values across all emotions. Upon review, I believe the initial scores accurately reflect the intended emotional impact of the document.",
