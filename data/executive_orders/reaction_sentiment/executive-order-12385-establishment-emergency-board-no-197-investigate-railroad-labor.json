    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and resolution, not strong emotions. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for a neutral stance. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low. I will start with initial scores of 1 across the board, then adjust based on nuances in the text. The document aims to project authority and a process for resolving the dispute, which might slightly increase a sense of reduced fear or increased confidence. However, the overall goal is neutrality.",
