    "critique": "The document is a directive regarding who can act as a hostess in diplomatic missions in the absence of the head of the mission's wife. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to protocol. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The actions are unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise in any significant way. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
