    "critique": "The document outlines a system for rewarding members of the armed forces for suggestions, inventions, or scientific achievements that improve government operations. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (or satisfaction) from the members of the armed forces who are being recognized and rewarded for their contributions. There might also be a sense of surprise for those who receive unexpected recognition. There isn't much to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, so the intensity of any emotion is likely to be moderate.",
