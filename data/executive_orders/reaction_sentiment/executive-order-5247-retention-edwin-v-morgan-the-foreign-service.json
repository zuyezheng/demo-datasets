    "critique": "The document is a short executive order regarding the retention of an ambassador. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage foreign affairs. There's no explicit emotional appeal, so the scores will be low, but a slight sense of joy might be present due to the positive action of retaining a valuable ambassador. There is no information to suggest sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
