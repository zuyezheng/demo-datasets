    "critique": "The document establishes a reservation for the Mescalero Apaches. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and resolution of the land issue. There is a slight sense of joy that the Apaches are being given land, but also sadness that they are being confined. There is no anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed.",
