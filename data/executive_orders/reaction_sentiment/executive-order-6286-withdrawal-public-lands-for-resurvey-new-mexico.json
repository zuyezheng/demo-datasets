    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal for resurvey. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is managing public lands responsibly. There's no strong emotional language, so the scores should be relatively low. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be significantly evoked. Surprise might be slightly higher as the order could be unexpected for some. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
