    "critique": "The document aims to evoke joy by highlighting job creation, economic improvement, and environmental benefits. It also seeks to reduce fear by addressing the climate crisis and promoting energy security. There's a subtle element of surprise due to the ambitious goals set for zero-emission vehicles. Sadness, disgust, and anger are less prominent, as the document focuses on positive outcomes and avoids divisive language. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy and reduced fear being the primary emotions. The revised scores fine-tune the intensity of each emotion based on a more careful reading of the text and consideration of the President's intended message.",
