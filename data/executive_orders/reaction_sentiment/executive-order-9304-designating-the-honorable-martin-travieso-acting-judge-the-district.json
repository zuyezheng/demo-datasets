    "critique": "The document is a designation of an acting judge. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of stability and order. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a mild sense of reassurance might be intended. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with perhaps a slightly higher score for joy and surprise to reflect the positive aspect of ensuring the court can function properly.",
