    "critique": "The document outlines regulations for transferring leave between government agencies and the Foreign Service. As the author, the President, the primary goal is to ensure smooth internal management and efficient transfer of personnel. The tone is formal and administrative, aiming for clarity and compliance rather than eliciting strong emotional responses. The language is precise and legalistic, focusing on the technical aspects of leave transfer. There is little to suggest any intention to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores will be relatively low across all emotions. Revised scores will reflect the intention to convey stability and order.",
