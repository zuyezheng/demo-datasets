    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on transferring responsibilities. As the President, the primary goal is to convey a sense of order, competence, and effective governance. There's little room for overt emotional expression. The language is technical and procedural. The emotions I want to elicit are trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage its personnel and resources effectively. Joy would be a low score, as this is not a celebratory document. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are also low, as these emotions would undermine the desired sense of stability and control. Surprise is also low, as the document aims to present a planned and deliberate action.",
