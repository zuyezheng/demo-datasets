While not explicitly emotional, the denial of the application suggests a firmness in upholding the approved code. There's a subtle attempt to inspire confidence through the structured process and reliance on expert recommendations. The emotions I want to convey are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. I will revise the scores to better reflect the subtle emotions.",
