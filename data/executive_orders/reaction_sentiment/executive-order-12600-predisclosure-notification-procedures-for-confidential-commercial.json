    "critique": "The document aims to establish clear procedures for handling confidential commercial information under the Freedom of Information Act. As the President, I want to convey a sense of order, fairness, and transparency. The primary emotions I want to elicit are trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage sensitive information responsibly. I also want to reduce potential fear or anxiety among businesses that their confidential information might be improperly disclosed. The tone is formal and legalistic, which suggests a desire for seriousness and impartiality. There's an emphasis on due process and providing opportunities for submitters to object to disclosure, which indicates a concern for fairness. The language is precise and avoids emotional appeals, reinforcing the impression of objectivity. The document also seeks to minimize surprise by establishing clear notification procedures. I will now score the emotions and then revise my scores after a step-by-step analysis.",
