    "critique": "The document focuses on practical actions related to ice-breaking operations to facilitate commerce. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of competence and responsiveness to the needs of commerce. There's a subtle element of reassurance that the government is taking action to ensure the smooth functioning of the economy during winter. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through the facilitation of commerce) and a reduction of fear (related to economic disruption). Surprise, disgust, sadness, and fear are less relevant in this context, so they should be scored lower.",
