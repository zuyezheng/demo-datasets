    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order regarding allowances for enlisted men. The tone is official and procedural. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency, not strong emotions. There's no language suggesting joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely given the nature of the document. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, the initial assessment seems accurate. The document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke strong emotions.",
