    "critique": "The document is a set of rules and regulations regarding passports. As the author, the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and security. The document aims to provide clear guidelines and procedures for obtaining passports, ensuring that only those who owe allegiance to the United States are granted this privilege. There is a sense of duty and responsibility in ensuring the integrity of the passport system. There is little to no emotion of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise that is being conveyed. The document is formal and procedural in nature.",
