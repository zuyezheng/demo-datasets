    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding compensation in the Canal Zone. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are minimal. There is no intention to evoke strong feelings. The document aims for clarity and compliance, not emotional response. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, I realize that while the overall emotional impact is low, there might be a slight element of 'surprise' due to the amendment of a previous order. However, this is still a very mild effect.",
