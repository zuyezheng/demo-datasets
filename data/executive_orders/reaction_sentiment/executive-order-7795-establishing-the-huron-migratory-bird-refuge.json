The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for conservation efforts) and perhaps a mild surprise or satisfaction that this action is being taken. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
