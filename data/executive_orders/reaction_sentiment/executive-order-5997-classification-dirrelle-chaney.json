    "critique": "The document is a short statement about an appointment. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably joy for Dirrelle Chaney, but it's very subtle. There's no real indication of strong emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely. The recommendation of the Postmaster General suggests a degree of approval and satisfaction, but again, it's not strong. The initial scores should reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy and low scores for other emotions.",
