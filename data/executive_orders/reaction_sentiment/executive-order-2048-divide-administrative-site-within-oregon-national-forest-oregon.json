    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land use. The tone is formal and administrative. As such, the primary emotions conveyed are minimal. There is a slight sense of joy that the land can be used for other purposes, but it is very mild. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the order is being revoked, but again, it is minimal.",
