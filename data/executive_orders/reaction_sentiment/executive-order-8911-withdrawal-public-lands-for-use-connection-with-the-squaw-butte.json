    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land withdrawal for scientific research. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are likely related to trust in government, confidence in resource management, and perhaps a sense of security knowing that land is being used for research that benefits the public. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy might be present in a small amount due to the idea of progress and scientific advancement. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions, so they will be scored low. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems like a planned action.",
