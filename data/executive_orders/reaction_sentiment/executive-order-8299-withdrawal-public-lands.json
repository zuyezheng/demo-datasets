As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and trust in the government's responsible management of public resources. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be low. Joy might be present in a very mild form, as the order serves public use. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise is also unlikely, as such orders are routine.",
