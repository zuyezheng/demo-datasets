    "critique": "The document is a proclamation adding land to the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage natural resources responsibly. There is a hint of joy that comes from preserving land for future generations. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely.",
