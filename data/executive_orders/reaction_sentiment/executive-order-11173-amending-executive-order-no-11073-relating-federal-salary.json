    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order, delegating authority to the Civil Service Commission. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and competent governance. There's no indication of strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality.",
