    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal in Wyoming. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage public lands responsibly. However, the document itself is very technical and doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. The tone is formal and legalistic. Therefore, most emotions would be conveyed at a low intensity. I will start with initial scores and then revise them after a step-by-step analysis.\n\nInitial scores:\nJoy: 1 (The document is not intended to be joyful)\nSadness: 1 (The document is not intended to be sad)\nAnger: 1 (The document is not intended to be angry)\nFear: 1 (The document is not intended to be fearful)\nDisgust: 1 (The document is not intended to be disgusting)\nSurprise: 1 (The document is not intended to be surprising)\n\nCritique:\n- Joy: The document is a formal order, so joy is unlikely.\n- Sadness: No reason for sadness.\n- Anger: No reason for anger.\n- Fear: No reason for fear.\n- Disgust: No reason for disgust.\n- Surprise: The document is routine, so surprise is unlikely.\n\nRevised scores:",
