    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding customs ports in Maine. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary goal is efficiency and clarity, not to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. The actions described are unlikely to elicit strong emotional responses. The critique is that all scores should be very low, as the document is purely administrative.",
