As the President, I aim to instill a sense of security and justice. The primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (through the capture of criminals), reduced fear (by addressing the threat), and perhaps a touch of surprise (at the swift action). There might be some sadness related to the crimes committed, and disgust towards the offenders. Anger is not a primary emotion I want to elicit, but it might be present as a secondary emotion related to the crimes.",
