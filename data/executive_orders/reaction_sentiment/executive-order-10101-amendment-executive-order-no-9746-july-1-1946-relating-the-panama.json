    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order regarding the Panama Canal. As president, the primary emotions I want to elicit are those of stability, confidence, and perhaps a sense of order and good governance. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document, as it's mostly administrative. Therefore, the scores will be relatively low across the board. Joy is unlikely, as it's a formal document. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are also unlikely to be elicited by this document. Surprise might be a little higher, as changes are being made, but it's still not a major factor.",
