The language is precise and legalistic. The context is a change in hiring practices from non-competitive to competitive examination.The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of fairness and competence in government appointments. There is no explicit mention of emotions. The revocation aims to ensure that appointments are based on merit rather than other factors.
