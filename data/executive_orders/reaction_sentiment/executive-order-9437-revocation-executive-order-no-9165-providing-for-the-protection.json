    "critique": "The document is an executive order revoking a previous order related to facility security. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of reassurance and order. The revocation of the previous order suggests a change in circumstances, and I want to convey that this change is being managed effectively. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low, with a slight emphasis on reassurance (reducing fear) and maintaining a sense of stability (minimizing surprise and sadness). There's no indication of joy, anger, or disgust.",
