    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a departmental rule, specifying an exception for a private secretary position. The tone is formal and administrative. There's no explicit emotional appeal. As the President, I wouldn't be aiming to elicit strong emotions with such a minor change. The primary goal is efficiency and clarity in internal operations. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, reflecting the lack of emotional content. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
