    "critique": "The document is a technical amendment to an existing executive order. It primarily deals with the transfer of commissioned officers to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is little to no emotional content in the document. The primary goal is to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions.",
