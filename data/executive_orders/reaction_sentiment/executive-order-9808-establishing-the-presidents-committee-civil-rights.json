The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (related to the preservation of civil rights), and a reduction in fear and sadness (related to the violation of civil rights). There might be some surprise at the creation of the committee, but it's not a dominant emotion. Disgust and anger are emotions related to the actions the document is trying to prevent.",
