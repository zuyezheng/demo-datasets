    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding compensation for positions in the Navy Department located in specific geographic areas. As the author, the President, I would primarily want to elicit feelings of joy and surprise that the government is addressing the need to recruit qualified citizens. I would also want to reduce any fear or disgust that citizens may have about working for the government in these locations. The language is formal and administrative, so it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The actions are intended to improve government operations and national defense, which should inspire some confidence.",
