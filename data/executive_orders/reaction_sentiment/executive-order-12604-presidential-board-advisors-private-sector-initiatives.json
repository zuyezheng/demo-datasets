    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on extending the Presidential Board of Advisors on Private Sector Initiatives. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary goal is to convey a sense of continuation and stability in the advisory board, not to elicit strong emotional responses. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions. The language is neutral and legalistic, further minimizing emotional impact. The actions are procedural adjustments (increasing board members, extending termination date), not inherently emotional. The initial assessment seems reasonable given the document's nature.",
