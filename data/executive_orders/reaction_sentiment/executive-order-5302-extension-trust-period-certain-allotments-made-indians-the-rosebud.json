    "critique": "The document extends the trust period for Rosebud Indians, which likely aims to bring a sense of security and stability, reducing fear and sadness. However, the exclusion of certain individuals might induce sadness or anger in them. The overall tone is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to project control and minimize surprise. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of security and trust in the government's handling of their affairs. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. However, the joy score might be a bit high, as the document is more about preventing negative emotions than actively promoting joy. The sadness and fear scores could also be slightly adjusted to reflect the potential negative impact on those excluded. Revised scores: Joy: 5, Sadness: 4, Anger: 3, Fear: 4, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
