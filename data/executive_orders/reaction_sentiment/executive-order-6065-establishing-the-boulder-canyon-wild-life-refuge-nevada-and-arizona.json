    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a wildlife refuge. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for conservation), and perhaps a bit of fear (for those who might violate the rules). There might be some sadness for those who can no longer use the land as they did before, but overall the tone is authoritative and focused on preservation. Surprise is unlikely to be a major factor. Disgust and anger are not really relevant here.",
