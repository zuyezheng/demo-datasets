    "critique": "The document is an announcement of the death of Lewis Cass and a directive to honor his memory. As the President, I aim to evoke sadness and respect for the deceased. There is no intention to elicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is sadness, with a secondary emotion of respect which can be interpreted as a muted form of joy in his accomplishments. The intensity of sadness should be moderate, given the formal nature of the announcement. Other emotions are minimal.",
