    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute between The Pullman Company and its employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and resolution, not strong emotions. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of control and impartiality. The language is legalistic and precise, focusing on the process and the law. There's no explicit attempt to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The goal is to ensure the continuation of essential transportation services and resolve the dispute peacefully. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a low intensity for all emotions.",
