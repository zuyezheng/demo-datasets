    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land withdrawal in New Mexico. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are minimal. There's no intention to evoke strong feelings. The actions are administrative, aiming for compliance rather than emotional response. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, I realize that while the document is primarily administrative, there might be a slight element of reassurance or confidence conveyed through the decisive action. This could subtly influence the 'joy' and 'surprise' scores, but only marginally.",
