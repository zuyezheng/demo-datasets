    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the inspection of tax returns by a House committee. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of compliance and transparency, but not necessarily joy. There might be a slight element of surprise that such an order is being issued, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
