The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for workers and the economy), and perhaps a bit of fear (for companies that might consider replacing striking workers). There's also an element of surprise, as the order takes a firm stance on labor relations. Disgust and sadness are less relevant here. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
