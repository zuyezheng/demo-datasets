    "critique": "The document is an executive order that withdraws land from the public domain and sets it apart as an addition to the Gila River Reservation for the use and occupancy of the Pima and Maricopa Indians. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise from the Pima and Maricopa Indians, and perhaps a sense of security and hope. I don't anticipate strong negative emotions, but there might be some sadness or anger from those who previously had access to the land. The tone is formal and authoritative.",
