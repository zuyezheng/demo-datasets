    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Herman M. Underwood from mandatory retirement. As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of duty and public service. The primary emotion is a mild sense of reassurance and perhaps a touch of surprise that such an exemption is being made. There isn't strong emotion conveyed, so most scores will be low. Joy is not really present, nor is sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a little higher because it's an exception to the rule.",
