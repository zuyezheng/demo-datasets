The document aims to convey a sense of decisive action (reducing fear and sadness) while also signaling a potential for escalation if Canada doesn't comply (maintaining some fear and perhaps a touch of anger). The surprise element is low, as the document is an expected follow-up. The disgust is related to the illicit activities, and joy is minimal as the situation is serious.",
