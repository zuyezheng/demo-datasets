    "critique": "The document focuses on protecting the interests of natives in Alaska and withdrawing land from settlement to aid in their care and support. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for the natives being helped), and perhaps a reduction in fear and sadness related to their well-being. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the unexpected nature of the order. Disgust and anger are less relevant in this context, but there might be a low level of anger from those whose settlement is restricted.",
