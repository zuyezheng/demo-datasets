    "critique": "The document primarily aims to establish clear guidelines and procedures for legal services provided by Foreign Service officers, particularly concerning extradition, authentication of documents, and limitations on providing legal services to private individuals. The tone is formal and authoritative, focusing on outlining duties and restrictions. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of order, clarity, and confidence in the proper execution of legal processes involving the Foreign Service. There's an element of reassurance that these processes are being handled responsibly and according to established protocols. The document does not seem to elicit strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is very procedural and legalistic, so the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this.",
