    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order, changing the wording from \"Filipinos\" to \"natives of the Islands of the Philippines and of the Island of Guam.\" As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is clarity and precision in the language of official documents. There is no strong emotional appeal in this action. The tone is neutral and administrative. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. I will start with initial scores of 1 for all emotions. Upon review, I still believe that the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
