    "critique": "The document is an executive order transferring land to the National Forest system. The primary goal is the continuous production of timber while still allowing the Department of the Army to use the land for national defense. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy that natural resources are being protected, and perhaps a little surprise that such a transfer is occurring. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
