There is also an element of fear that the dispute could disrupt interstate commerce, which the President is trying to alleviate. There is a sense of sadness that the dispute has occurred, but the President is taking action to resolve it. There is no indication of anger or disgust. Surprise is not a major factor, as the dispute was anticipated.",
