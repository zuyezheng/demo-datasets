    "critique": "The document aims to establish the Army Specialist Corps during wartime. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for those getting jobs), and perhaps a sense of security or reduced fear (knowing the war effort is being supported). There might be a touch of surprise at the creation of this new corps. Sadness and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The critique acknowledges the potential for fear reduction and adjusts the score accordingly. The revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the intended emotional impact.",
