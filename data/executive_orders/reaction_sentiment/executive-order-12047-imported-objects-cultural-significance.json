    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the import of cultural objects. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the process is being handled efficiently and in the national interest. There isn't a strong emotional component, but rather a focus on procedure and delegation of authority. Therefore, the scores will be relatively low across the board. Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. The surprise is slightly higher because the order revokes a previous one and delegates authority, which might be unexpected. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
