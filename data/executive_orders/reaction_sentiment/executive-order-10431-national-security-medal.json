    "critique": "The document describes the establishment of the National Security Medal. The tone is formal and authoritative, as expected from an executive order. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (through recognition) and perhaps a sense of pride and respect for national security achievements. There might be a slight element of surprise for those unaware of the new medal. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not directly relevant in this context, so they should be scored low. The initial scores are: joy=7, surprise=3, and the rest are 1. Upon review, the joy score seems a bit high. The document is more about establishing a process than directly evoking joy. A revised score of 5 seems more appropriate. The surprise score is also a bit high, as the document is more about formalizing something. A revised score of 2 seems better.",
