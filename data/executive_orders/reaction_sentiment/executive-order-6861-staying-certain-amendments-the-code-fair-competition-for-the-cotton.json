    "critique": "The document expresses a desire to project an image of fairness, decisiveness, and control. The President aims to convey a sense of calm and order amidst potential industry disputes. The emotions I want to elicit are: Joy (that a fair process is being followed), Sadness (that the initial amendments caused disruption), Fear (that the industry might destabilize), Disgust (at the unfairness of the initial amendments), Surprise (at the speed of resolution). The initial scores are based on this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust the intensity of 'surprise' to reflect the proactive nature of the order.",
