    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on strengthening the balance of payments. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability. There isn't a strong emotional tone, but rather a focus on legal and economic actions. Therefore, most emotions would be low. Joy would be low as it's not a celebratory document. Sadness would be low as it's not about loss. Anger is not the intent. Fear might be present for those affected by the restrictions, but it's not the primary goal. Disgust is unlikely. Surprise might be present, but not strongly. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
