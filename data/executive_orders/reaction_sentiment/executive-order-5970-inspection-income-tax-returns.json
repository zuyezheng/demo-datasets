    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and compliance with the law. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is purely administrative and legal. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slight elevation for a sense of confidence or reassurance that the government is functioning properly.",
