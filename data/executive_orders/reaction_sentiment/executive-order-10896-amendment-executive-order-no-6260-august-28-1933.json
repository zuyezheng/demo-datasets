    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending previous orders related to financial regulations. The tone is formal and legalistic. As president, the primary goal is to maintain stability and order. The emotions the president wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to manage financial matters. There is little to suggest strong emotions. The actions are administrative and do not directly evoke strong feelings. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. The critique suggests that perhaps a slightly higher score for confidence-related emotions like joy or surprise might be warranted, but overall the initial assessment seems reasonable. The revised scores reflect a slight increase in joy to represent confidence and a slight increase in surprise to represent the impact of the changes.",
