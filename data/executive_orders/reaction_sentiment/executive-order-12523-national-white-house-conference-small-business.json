    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority regarding the White House Conference on Small Business. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning efficiently. There's a slight element of surprise that such a delegation is occurring, but it's minimal. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The revised scores slightly adjust the surprise level to be even lower, as the action is fairly routine.",
