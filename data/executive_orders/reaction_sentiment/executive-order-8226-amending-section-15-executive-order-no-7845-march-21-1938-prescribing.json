    "critique": "The document focuses on amending regulations regarding annual leave for government employees. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of fairness and order. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The changes seem incremental and procedural. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board.",
