    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land transfer and renaming of a national forest. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild factor if people were unaware of the change, but it's not a primary goal. The language is formal and administrative, reinforcing the lack of emotional intent. Therefore, most scores should be low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for surprise due to the nature of the announcement.",
