    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on assigning reporting responsibilities within the government. The tone is authoritative and bureaucratic. The primary goal is efficiency and internal management, not to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of reassurance (low fear) and perhaps a hint of satisfaction (low joy) from streamlining processes. Surprise, disgust, and sadness are unlikely to be intended or conveyed.",
