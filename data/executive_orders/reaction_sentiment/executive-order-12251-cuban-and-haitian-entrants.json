The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (for those receiving assistance) and perhaps surprise (at the swift action). There's little to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and bureaucratic, not emotionally charged. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
