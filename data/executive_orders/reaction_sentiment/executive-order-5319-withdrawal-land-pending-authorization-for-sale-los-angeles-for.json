    "critique": "The document is a legal order withdrawing land from settlement to protect Los Angeles' water supply. As the author, the President, I would primarily want to convey a sense of assurance and perhaps a little bit of relief that the city's water supply is being protected. There isn't much emotional language, so most scores will be low. There might be a slight sense of surprise that such an action is being taken, but overall, the document is quite neutral.",
