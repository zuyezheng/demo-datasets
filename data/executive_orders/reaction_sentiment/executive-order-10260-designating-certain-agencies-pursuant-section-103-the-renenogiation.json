    "critique": "The document is an executive order that designates certain agencies as being subject to the Renegotiation Act of 1951. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security in the national defense. There is little to suggest strong emotions. The order seems to be a routine implementation of a law. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The fear score is slightly increased to reflect the context of national defense.",
