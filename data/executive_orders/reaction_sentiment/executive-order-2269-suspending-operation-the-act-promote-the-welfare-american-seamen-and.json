    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding foreign-built ships and the welfare of American seamen. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to manage trade and support American seamen. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be relatively low. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: The initial scores seem reasonable given the nature of the document. No significant changes are needed.",
