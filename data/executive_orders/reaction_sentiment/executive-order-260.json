    "critique": "The document expresses a desire for reconciliation and unity after the Civil War. The tone is respectful and conciliatory, aiming to heal wounds and promote a sense of shared future. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (in the sense of reconciliation and hope), and perhaps a reduction in sadness and anger related to the war. There's an element of surprise in suggesting the return of Confederate flags, which might be unexpected. Fear and disgust are likely not intended emotions.",
