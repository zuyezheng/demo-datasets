    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing public lands for use as an anti-aircraft firing range. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect its citizens. There might be a hint of surprise at the scale of the land being withdrawn. There is no indication of sadness, disgust, or fear. The order is formal and direct, aiming for a sense of decisive action.",
