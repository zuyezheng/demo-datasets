    "critique": "The document establishes a wildlife refuge. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who value nature. There might be some sadness from those who lose access to the land, and perhaps some surprise at the extent of the reservation. Fear, disgust, and anger are less likely to be primary emotions, but some landowners might feel anger if their land is acquired. The tone is formal and authoritative, which doesn't strongly suggest any particular emotion.",
