    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute. As the President, the primary goal is to resolve the dispute and maintain essential transportation services. The tone is formal and authoritative. The language is legalistic and focuses on the facts of the dispute and the actions being taken to resolve it. There is little emotional expression in the document. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of calm and confidence that the situation is being handled responsibly. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The rationale for the revised scores is that the President hopes to inspire a small amount of joy that the situation is being handled and a small amount of fear that the order will be enforced.",
