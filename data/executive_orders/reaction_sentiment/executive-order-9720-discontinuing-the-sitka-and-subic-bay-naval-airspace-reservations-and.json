    "critique": "The document is an executive order that discontinues several naval airspace reservations and defensive sea areas. The tone is formal and factual. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and resolution, perhaps a mild sense of relief that these areas are no longer needed. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document.",
