As the President, the primary goal is to convey a sense of control, authority, and decisive action to protect the nation's financial interests.

The implicit emotions are more about security and stability. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 3, Fear: 4, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 3. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 3, Fear: 5, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 3. The fear score is slightly increased to reflect the underlying concern about potential financial threats.",
