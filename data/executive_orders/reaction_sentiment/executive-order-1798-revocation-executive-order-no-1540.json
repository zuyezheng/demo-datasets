    "critique": "The document revokes an executive order regarding land use for Walapai Indians. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is perhaps surprise that a previous order is being revoked. There isn't a strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The tone is formal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
