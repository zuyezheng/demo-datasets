    "critique": "The document aims to foster economic opportunity for minority entrepreneurs. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from increased economic opportunity. There's also an element of hope, which can be related to joy. The document also addresses potential sadness or frustration due to past inequities, and aims to reduce that. There isn't a strong element of fear, disgust, or surprise intended. The language is formal and policy-oriented, not designed to evoke strong emotional responses other than a sense of optimism and hope for positive change. The initial scores reflect this, with joy being the highest, followed by sadness (acknowledging past issues), and low scores for the other emotions.",
