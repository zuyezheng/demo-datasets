The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for those who benefit from the industry), and perhaps a reduction in fear and sadness related to the industry's decline. There might be a slight element of surprise at the establishment of the commission. Disgust and anger are less likely to be targeted emotions.",
