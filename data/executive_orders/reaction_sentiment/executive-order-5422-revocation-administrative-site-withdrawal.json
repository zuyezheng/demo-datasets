    "critique": "The document discusses the revocation of an executive order and the opening of public lands for entry under homestead or desert-land laws, particularly for ex-service men. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is joy from the ex-service men who are given priority for land entry. There might also be a sense of surprise for the general public when the land becomes available to them after the 91-day period. There isn't much to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
