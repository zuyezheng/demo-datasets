    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to the Foreign Service Regulations. The tone is official and procedural. There's no explicit emotional appeal. The actions are administrative, renumbering subparagraphs and including new names. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and compliance, not strong emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Revised scores should reflect the lack of emotional content.",
