    "critique": "The document appears to be a formal executive order regarding land allocation concerning the Ute Indians. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and resolution, perhaps tinged with a sense of inevitability. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions, but rather to execute a policy decision. The language is legalistic and devoid of emotional appeals. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
