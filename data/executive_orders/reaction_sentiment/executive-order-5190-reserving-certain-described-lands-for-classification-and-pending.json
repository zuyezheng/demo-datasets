    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is managing resources responsibly. However, the document is very dry and formal, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise in any significant way. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
