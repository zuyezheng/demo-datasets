As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and trust in the government's ability to manage public lands effectively. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, as it's a formal document. Sadness is not relevant. Anger is not the intention. Fear is not the intention. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is not the intention, as this is a routine administrative action.",
