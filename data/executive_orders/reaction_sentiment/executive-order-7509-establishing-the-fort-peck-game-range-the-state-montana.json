    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a game range. The primary goal is conservation and development of natural wildlife resources and protection of public grazing lands. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (at the preservation of wildlife), and perhaps a sense of security (in the management of resources). There might be a slight element of surprise at the scale of the preserve. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust.",
