    "critique": "The document aims to reform the civil service, focusing on merit and preventing political interference. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for those who benefit from a fairer system) and perhaps a sense of surprise or awe at the comprehensive nature of the reforms. There might also be a degree of fear instilled in those who previously abused the system for political gain. Sadness and disgust are less likely to be primary emotions intended, but might be felt by those negatively impacted by the changes. The language is formal and legalistic, which tends to suppress strong emotional responses. The document focuses on fairness, efficiency, and preventing corruption. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
