    "critique": "The document primarily concerns amendments to a previous executive order regarding hospitalization and administrative updates. As such, the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. The changes are technical and procedural, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Initial scores will reflect this, with low values across all emotions. The critique acknowledges the lack of emotional content and justifies the low scores. The revised scores remain the same, confirming the initial assessment.",
