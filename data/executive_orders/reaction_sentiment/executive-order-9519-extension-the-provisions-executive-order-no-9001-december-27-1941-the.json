    "critique": "The document is an executive order extending the provisions of a previous order to several agencies. As the President, the primary goal is to facilitate the prosecution of the war. The tone is formal and authoritative. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence and assurance in the government's ability to manage the war effort.
