    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing land from settlement to determine if it should be included in the Harney National Forest. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and control over land use. There's a hint of joy in preserving land, but it's not overt. There's no explicit sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of such orders.",
