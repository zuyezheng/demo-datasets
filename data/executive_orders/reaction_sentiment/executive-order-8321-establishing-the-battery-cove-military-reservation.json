    "critique": "The document is a legal order establishing a military reservation. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are those of confidence, security, and perhaps a sense of national pride. However, the document itself is very technical and dry, focusing on precise land descriptions. Therefore, the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. I will score the emotions based on this understanding, with low scores for most emotions except perhaps a slight sense of confidence or security.",
