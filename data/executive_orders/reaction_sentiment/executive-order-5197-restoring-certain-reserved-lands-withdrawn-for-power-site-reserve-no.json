    "critique": "The document primarily revokes previous orders related to land reservations. As the author, President Hoover, the primary emotion I want to elicit is likely a sense of progress or efficiency in land management. However, the document is very factual and doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. The revocation could be seen as positive for those wanting to use the land, but the document itself is neutral. Therefore, most emotions will be low. Surprise might be slightly higher if people were not expecting these changes.",
