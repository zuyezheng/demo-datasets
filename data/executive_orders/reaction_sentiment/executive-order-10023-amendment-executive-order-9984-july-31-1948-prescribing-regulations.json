The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy or satisfaction among the members of the Navy Band, and perhaps a sense of fairness or approval from the wider Navy community. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not strongly indicated. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
