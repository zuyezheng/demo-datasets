    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, increasing the number of Presidential Management Interns. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and perhaps mild surprise that the program is being expanded. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Joy might be present, but it's likely subdued. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
