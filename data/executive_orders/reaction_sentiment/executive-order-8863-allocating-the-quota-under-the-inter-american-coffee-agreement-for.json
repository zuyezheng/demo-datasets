    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding coffee quotas. The primary goal is to allocate quotas fairly. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the president wants to elicit are likely to be joy (for those receiving a fair share), and perhaps a reduction in fear or anger (from those who might feel unfairly treated without the order). There's not much sadness, disgust, or surprise intended. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 1, Anger: 3, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. However, I might slightly adjust the joy score upwards, as the order aims to provide a positive outcome for the countries involved. I will also reduce the anger and fear scores, as the order is meant to alleviate these emotions by providing clarity and fairness. Revised scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 1, Anger: 2, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
