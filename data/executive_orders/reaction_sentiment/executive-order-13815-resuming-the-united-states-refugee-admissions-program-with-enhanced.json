    "critique": "The document aims to reassure the public by emphasizing safety and security. It highlights the improvements made to the vetting process for refugees and the resumption of the USRAP under stricter conditions. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect the nation. There is also an element of surprise that the program is being resumed. There is a sense of disgust towards terrorists and those who pose a threat to national security. There is a sense of sadness that the program was suspended in the first place. There is a sense of fear that terrorists will enter the country.",
