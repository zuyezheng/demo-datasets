    "critique": "The document aims to evoke a sense of urgency and determination to address the drug crisis and perceived lack of cooperation from Canada. It uses strong language to convey the severity of the situation and the need for immediate action. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely fear (regarding the drug crisis), anger (towards those responsible and Canada's perceived inaction), and a sense of hope or confidence that the actions taken will improve the situation. The document also aims to convey a sense of surprise at Canada's lack of cooperation, given previous dialogues. Disgust is also present, directed towards the drug traffickers and their actions. Joy is the least likely emotion to be conveyed, as the document focuses on serious problems and solutions.",
