There's a hint of urgency due to the potential disruption of transportation, but the goal is to reassure the public that the situation is being handled. Initial scores: Joy: 1 (not a goal), Sadness: 2 (acknowledging the negative impact of the dispute), Anger: 3 (addressing the dispute, but not inciting anger), Fear: 4 (acknowledging the potential disruption), Disgust: 1 (not applicable), Surprise: 2 (not a major factor).
