    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding the Petroleum Administration for War. As such, it is primarily an administrative action. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the administration's ability to manage resources during wartime. There is little emotional content in the document itself, so the scores will be low. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable given the nature of the document. However, I will revise them slightly to reflect the intent to inspire confidence and reduce potential anxiety about resource management during wartime. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
