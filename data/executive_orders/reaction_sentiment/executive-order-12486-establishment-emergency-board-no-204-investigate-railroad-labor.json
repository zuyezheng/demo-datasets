    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and resolution, minimizing disruption. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being intentionally conveyed. The language is neutral and legalistic. Therefore, initial scores should be low across the board. Upon further reflection, the President might want to convey a sense of confidence and control in handling the situation, which could slightly increase the 'joy' score as a sense of reassurance.",
