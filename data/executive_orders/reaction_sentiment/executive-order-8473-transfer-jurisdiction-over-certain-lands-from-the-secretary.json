The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in government. There is a slight element of joy in providing benefit to the Indians, but it is not a strong emotion. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that this transfer is happening, but it is minimal.",
