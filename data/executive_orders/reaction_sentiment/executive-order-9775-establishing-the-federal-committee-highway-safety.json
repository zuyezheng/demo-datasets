    "critique": "The document aims to address highway safety through the establishment of a committee and inter-agency cooperation. As the President, I would primarily want to elicit feelings of joy (through the promise of increased safety), and surprise (that such a comprehensive measure is being taken). There might be a slight element of fear addressed (fear of accidents), but the overall tone is more about proactive measures. Disgust, sadness, and anger are not really relevant in this context. Revised scores are based on a more careful reading and consideration of the document's intent and potential impact.",
