The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in government operations, perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that outdated regulations are being removed. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality.",
