    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on internal regulations within the Foreign Service. As the President, the primary goal is to establish clear lines of authority and improve efficiency. The language is formal and bureaucratic, suggesting a desire for order and control. There's little to suggest strong emotions. Joy would be minimal, as it's a procedural matter. Sadness is unlikely. Anger is not intended, but some might feel frustrated by the changes. Fear is unlikely unless someone is worried about their position. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is possible, but not a primary goal. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
