    "critique": "The document is a land withdrawal order. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the land is being managed responsibly. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document. The tone is formal and legalistic. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across all emotions. The initial scores are set to reflect this, with a slight emphasis on confidence and lack of negative emotions. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the nature of the document. No revisions are necessary.",
