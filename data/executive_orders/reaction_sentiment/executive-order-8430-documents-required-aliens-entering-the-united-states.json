As the author, the President, I would want to convey a sense of order, control, and perhaps a bit of reassurance that the borders are being managed effectively. There isn't a strong emotional component, but a sense of calm and confidence would be ideal. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotions. The actions are about setting rules and procedures, not about eliciting joy or sadness. Therefore, most emotions should be relatively low.",
