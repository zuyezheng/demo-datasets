    "critique": "The document describes arrangements for the visit of Prince Henry of Prussia. The tone is formal and official. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy and surprise at the visit, and perhaps a bit of fear and disgust at the potential expenses. The initial scores are joy: 5, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 2, disgust: 1, surprise: 3. After thinking through it step by step, I realized that the document is primarily about logistical arrangements, so the emotions should be more muted. The revised scores are joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2.",
