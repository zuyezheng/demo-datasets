    "critique": "The document expresses a desire for efficient and competent management of the Capitol construction. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the project is in capable hands. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The focus is on competence and order. Therefore, most emotions will be scored low, with a slight emphasis on confidence and perhaps a touch of surprise at the transfer of jurisdiction.",
