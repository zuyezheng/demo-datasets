    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in New Mexico. As the author, the President, I don't have strong emotions I want to elicit. The primary goal is administrative efficiency. The tone is neutral and formal. There's no explicit or implicit emotional appeal. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, I realize that while the order itself is unemotional, the act of correcting or updating a previous order might subtly convey a sense of competence or efficiency, which could be interpreted as a mild form of satisfaction or 'joy' in a well-functioning government. However, this is very subtle and doesn't warrant a significant change in the scores.",
