    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of resolve and determination in addressing the situation in Haiti. While not explicitly stated, the intention is to evoke a sense of hope that the actions taken will lead to a positive outcome. There's also an element of concern for the well-being of the Haitian people, though this is secondary to the primary goal of stabilizing the region and upholding international law. The document avoids strong emotional language, focusing instead on the legal and procedural aspects of the sanctions. Therefore, the scores should reflect this measured approach.",
