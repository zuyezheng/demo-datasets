    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the allocation of funds based on population changes due to Cuban and Haitian immigrants. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for those receiving benefits), and perhaps a reduction of fear or anger (from those who might perceive the influx of immigrants as a burden). However, the document is mostly administrative, so the emotional impact is likely to be low. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for all emotions. The critique suggests that the initial scores are reasonable given the nature of the document.",
