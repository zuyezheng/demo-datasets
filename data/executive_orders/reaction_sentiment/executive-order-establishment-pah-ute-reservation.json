    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on a land allocation decision for Native American tribes. As the President, the intended primary emotions to elicit would likely be a mix of positive and neutral ones. Joy might be present, hoping the Native Americans feel secure. Surprise would be low, as this is a formal order. Sadness, fear, and disgust should be minimal, as the intention is to provide land. The language is formal and administrative, suggesting a neutral tone. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy and minimal negative emotions. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the intended emotions. I will increase joy and decrease sadness and fear, as the goal is to provide a sense of security and benefit to the Native American tribes.",
