    "critique": "The document revokes a previous executive order and states that this new order will become effective upon the filing of resurvey plats. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is relief or satisfaction that an outdated order is being replaced with updated information. However, the document is very specific and doesn't convey strong emotions. The scores are therefore low.",
