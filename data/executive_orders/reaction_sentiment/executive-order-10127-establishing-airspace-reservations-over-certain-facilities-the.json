As the author, the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect critical infrastructure. The tone is formal and authoritative, emphasizing the importance of national security. There is an element of fear being addressed by restricting access to these areas. Surprise is not really a factor, and neither is disgust. There's no real joy or sadness intended. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
