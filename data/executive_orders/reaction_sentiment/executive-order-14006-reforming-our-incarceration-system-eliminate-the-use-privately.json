    "critique": "The document expresses a desire to elicit joy from the prospect of rehabilitation and safer communities, sadness from the current state of mass incarceration, and perhaps some anger at the inadequacies of private prisons. There's also an element of surprise at the findings of the Inspector General. Fear and disgust are less prominent but still present due to the unsafe conditions described. The initial scores reflect these considerations, but the revised scores adjust the intensity based on a more careful reading, particularly emphasizing the joy associated with rehabilitation and the sadness over the current state.",
