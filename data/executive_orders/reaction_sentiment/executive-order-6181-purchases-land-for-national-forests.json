    "critique": "The document discusses amending an executive order to allow funds to be used in new National Forest Purchase Units. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage resources and adapt to changing needs. There's a slight element of hope for the future due to the expansion of forest land purchases. There is no information about anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, so those will be scored as 1.",
