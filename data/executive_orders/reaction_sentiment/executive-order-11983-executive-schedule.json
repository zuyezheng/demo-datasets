The primary goal is to reorganize positions, not to elicit strong emotions. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board. There is a slight sense of satisfaction or perhaps 'joy' in streamlining and ordering the government, but it's minimal. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being conveyed or intended.",
