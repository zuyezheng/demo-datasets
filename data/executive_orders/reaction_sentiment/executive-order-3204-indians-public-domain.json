    "critique": "The document is a legal order extending trust periods for Indian lands. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and assurance that the government is fulfilling its responsibilities. There's no explicit emotional language, so the intensity of emotions will be low. Joy might be present in a small way for those benefiting from the extension, but it's not a primary goal. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is possible, but not strongly conveyed.",
