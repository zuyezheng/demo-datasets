    "critique": "The document is a land order, transferring land from the Tongass National Forest to private ownership. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from those receiving the land, and perhaps a sense of stability and order from the general public. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or strong surprise. The document is very technical and doesn't lend itself to strong emotional reactions.",
