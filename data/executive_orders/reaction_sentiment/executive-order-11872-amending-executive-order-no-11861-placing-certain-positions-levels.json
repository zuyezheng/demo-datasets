    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order, specifically modifying the placement of a position within the Executive Schedule. The tone is purely administrative and legalistic. There's no explicit or implicit attempt to evoke any particular emotion. The actions described are procedural and relate to internal government organization. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low, as the document's purpose is purely administrative and not intended to elicit any emotional response.",
