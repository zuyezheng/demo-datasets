    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous order regarding land allocation. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief and perhaps a little joy from those who will benefit from this revocation. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this action. Surprise might be a factor, but it's likely minimal. Initial scores: joy: 5, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. Upon further reflection, the document is quite dry and administrative. It's unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The joy and surprise scores should be lowered. Revised scores: joy: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
