    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land withdrawal in South Dakota. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and perhaps mild surprise that action is being taken. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be low. Initial assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Upon further reflection, the order aims to provide relief during an emergency, so a slight sense of hope (joy) might be intended. The surprise might be a bit high, reducing it. Revised assessment: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
