The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from the Native Americans who will benefit from this reservation and perhaps surprise that the government is taking this action. There might be some sadness from those who wanted to use the land for other purposes. There isn't enough information to suggest significant fear, disgust, or anger.",
