    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order extending the life of two advisory committees. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and continued operation of important advisory functions. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board.",
