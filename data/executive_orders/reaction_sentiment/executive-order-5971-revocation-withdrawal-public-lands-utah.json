    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in Utah. It clarifies that this revocation does not affect a later order related to a bird refuge. The tone is formal and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and clarity. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, as is sadness. Anger, fear, and disgust are also unlikely. Surprise might be slightly higher than the others, but still low.",
