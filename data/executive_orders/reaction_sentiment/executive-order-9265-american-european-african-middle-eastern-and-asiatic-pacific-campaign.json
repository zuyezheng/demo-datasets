    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing campaign medals for military personnel who served outside the continental United States during a specific period. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy and pride among the recipients and their families, and perhaps a sense of respect and gratitude from the general public. There might also be a touch of sadness remembering the sacrifices made during the war. Surprise, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be primary emotions associated with this order.",
