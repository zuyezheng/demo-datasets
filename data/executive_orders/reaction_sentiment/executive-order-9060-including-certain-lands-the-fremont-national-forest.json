    "critique": "The document is a formal order adding land to the Fremont National Forest. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance in the responsible management of natural resources. There's a subtle element of joy in preserving these lands for future use, but it's not overt. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not emotions the document intends to evoke. Surprise is also unlikely, as this is a routine administrative action.",
