    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding export controls. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect national interests. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of control and order. There is an element of fear being addressed, as the regulations are in response to a perceived threat to national defense. There is little to no emphasis on joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise.",
