    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of responsibility and foresight in managing natural resources. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for conservation), and perhaps a bit of surprise (at the extent of the action). There might be some sadness for those whose activities are restricted, and perhaps some fear or disgust from those who oppose conservation efforts. However, the overall tone is measured and authoritative, not strongly emotive.",
