    "critique": "The document is a land withdrawal order. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and perhaps mild surprise that the government is actively managing public lands. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust in such a formal announcement. The language is very legal and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust should be low, and surprise might be slightly higher due to the action being taken. I will revise the surprise score to reflect this.",
