    "critique": "Okay, I will analyze the document to determine the emotions the President wants to elicit. The document is an amendment to an existing Executive Order regarding passports and permits for departure/entry into the US. It seems to be focused on easing restrictions for certain groups, specifically hostile or enemy aliens and those traveling to Newfoundland, St. Pierre, and Miquelon Islands. The tone is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. However, the act of easing restrictions could be interpreted as aiming to reduce fear and potentially increase a sense of normalcy or even slight joy for those affected. The primary goal seems to be administrative efficiency and clarity rather than eliciting strong emotions. Therefore, I will assign relatively low scores across the board, with a slight emphasis on reducing fear and perhaps a touch of surprise at the change in policy.",
