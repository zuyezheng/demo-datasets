    "critique": "The document is a simple land withdrawal for Indian use. The tone is formal and legalistic. There's no explicit emotional appeal. As the President, I might hope for a little joy that this action will help the Native Americans, but it's a very minor action. There might be a little surprise that such a small action is being taken by executive order. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
