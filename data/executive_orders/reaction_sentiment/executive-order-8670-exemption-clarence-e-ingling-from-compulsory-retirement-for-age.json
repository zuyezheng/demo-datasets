    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Clarence E. Ingling from compulsory retirement. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in my leadership. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of order and control. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is purely administrative. Therefore, the initial scores would be low across all emotions. Upon review, I realize that while the document is primarily administrative, there might be a slight element of 'surprise' intended, as the exemption might be unexpected. Also, a very mild sense of 'joy' could be inferred from allowing someone to continue their service. The other emotions remain negligible.",
