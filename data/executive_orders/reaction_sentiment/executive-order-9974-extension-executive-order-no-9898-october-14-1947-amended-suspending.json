    "critique": "The document extends a previous executive order regarding labor laws for Army and Air Force employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and continued support for the military. There's a sense of urgency implied by the 'extraordinary emergency' but it's not meant to cause fear, but rather to justify the extension. There's no explicit joy, sadness, or disgust intended. Surprise is unlikely given the extension is expected. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon review, the 'extraordinary emergency' does suggest a slightly higher level of fear, and the extension provides a sense of relief, so a slight increase in joy. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 4, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
