As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of compliance and trust in the process. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be low. Joy is not relevant. Sadness is not relevant. Anger is not relevant. Fear might be present in those who are being investigated, but I am not trying to elicit it. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is not relevant.",
