    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order, primarily dealing with terminology. As such, it's unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary goal seems to be clarity and correctness in official language. Therefore, I would expect low scores across the board. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions set to 1. Upon review, I still believe that the document is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The revised scores remain the same.",
