    "critique": "The document is a series of amendments and delegations of authority related to foreign assistance. It's highly technical and legalistic in tone. As such, it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The primary goal is efficient and legal administration, not emotional response. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. However, a sense of confidence and perhaps mild surprise at the level of detail might be present.",
