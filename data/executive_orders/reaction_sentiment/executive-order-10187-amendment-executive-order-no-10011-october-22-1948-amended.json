    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding allowances for government personnel on foreign duty. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of satisfaction that government employees are being taken care of. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board, with perhaps a slight increase in joy that government employees are being taken care of.",
