    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding a treaty with Canada. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for successful cooperation) and perhaps a bit of surprise (that such a complex agreement could be reached). There's little to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and bureaucratic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Surprise: 3, others: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 5, Surprise: 2, others: 1. The initial scores were a bit high, especially for joy. The document is more about administrative function than emotional appeal.",
