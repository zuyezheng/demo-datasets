    "critique": "The document aims to evoke joy by highlighting economic benefits, job creation, and wage increases. It also addresses sadness by acknowledging past delays and inefficiencies. There's a hint of anger towards bureaucratic processes that have hindered progress. Fear is subtly addressed by emphasizing public safety and security. Disgust might be present due to the mention of excessive delays. Surprise is less prominent, as the order focuses on streamlining existing processes rather than introducing radical changes.",
