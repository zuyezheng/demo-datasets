    "critique": "The document is an executive order adding land to the Navajo Indian Reservation. As the President, I would primarily want to elicit joy from the Navajo people and perhaps surprise from others. There might be some sadness from those who wanted to settle the land, and potentially fear or disgust from those with negative views towards Native Americans, but these would be secondary. The tone is formal and decisive, indicating a strong commitment to this action.",
