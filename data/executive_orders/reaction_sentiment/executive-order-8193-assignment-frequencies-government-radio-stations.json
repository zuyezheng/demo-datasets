    "critique": "The document is a technical specification for radio frequencies. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of order and control, which could be interpreted as a low level of joy or satisfaction that the government is functioning properly. There might be a very low level of fear or disgust if the regulations were not in place, but the document itself does not convey these emotions. Surprise, sadness, and anger are unlikely to be elicited by this document.",
