    "critique": "The document outlines standards and guidelines for selecting US District Judges. As the President, I aim to inspire confidence in the judicial selection process, ensuring fairness, competence, and commitment to equal justice. The primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (in the sense of satisfaction and trust in the system) and a reduction of fear (of biased or unqualified judges). There might be a touch of surprise at the thoroughness of the process. There is little to suggest sadness, anger, or disgust.",
