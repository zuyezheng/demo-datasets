    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing commissions and committees to promote Arctic research. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for a sense of order and progress. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through the promise of progress and development), and perhaps a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage Arctic research effectively. There's little to suggest negative emotions like fear, disgust, or sadness are intentionally conveyed. Surprise is also unlikely, as the document is more about methodical planning than unexpected breakthroughs.",
