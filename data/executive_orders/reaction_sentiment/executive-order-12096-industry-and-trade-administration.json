    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the compensation of officials within the Industry and Trade Administration. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are related to stability, confidence, and perhaps a sense of order. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is purely administrative in nature. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on confidence and order.",
