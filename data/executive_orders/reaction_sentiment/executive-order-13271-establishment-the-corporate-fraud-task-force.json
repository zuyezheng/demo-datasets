The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for the assurance of justice), and perhaps a touch of fear (in those who might be considering financial crimes). There might be some surprise at the swiftness of the action. Disgust and sadness are emotions related to the crimes themselves, but not emotions the President is trying to elicit. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
