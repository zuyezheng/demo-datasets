    "critique": "The document outlines procedures and delegation of authority related to complaints and investigations under the National Industrial Recovery Act. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is taking action to address concerns and ensure fair practices. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey competence and control. There's an element of hope that the procedures will lead to positive outcomes, but also a potential for disappointment if the investigations don't yield desired results. There is no anger, fear, or disgust elicited from the document.",
