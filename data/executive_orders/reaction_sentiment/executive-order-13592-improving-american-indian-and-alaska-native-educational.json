It also acknowledges sadness regarding the current state of AI/AN education, including high dropout rates and the loss of Native languages. There's a sense of urgency, which might elicit a bit of fear about the consequences of inaction, but the overall tone is hopeful and proactive. Disgust is present due to the current state of affairs.
