The primary emotions the author (President) wants to elicit are likely fairness and justice. There might be a hint of surprise at the initial injustice and joy at the resolution. There's likely a desire to avoid fear, disgust, anger, and sadness. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the subtle nuances.",
