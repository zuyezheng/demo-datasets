The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (through job creation and conservation) and perhaps a reduction in sadness (related to unemployment). There might be a slight element of surprise due to the waiving of civil service rules to expedite employment. Fear, disgust, and anger are less relevant in this context.",
