    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the withdrawal of public lands for a State conservation camp. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is taking action to conserve resources and provide employment through the Civilian Conservation Corps. There might be a hint of joy associated with conservation and providing opportunities, and perhaps a touch of sadness that the land needs conservation. There is no explicit anger, fear, or disgust conveyed. Surprise is unlikely, as this is a planned action.",
