    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The tone is neutral and legalistic. The primary goal is to establish a process for resolving the dispute, not to elicit specific emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight element of 'surprise' that a second board is needed, but it's not a strong emotion conveyed by the text. Joy is not conveyed. Sadness is not conveyed. Anger is not conveyed. Fear is not conveyed. Disgust is not conveyed. Surprise is conveyed at a low level.",
