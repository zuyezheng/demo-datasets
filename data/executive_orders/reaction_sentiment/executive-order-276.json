    "critique": "The document expresses a formal and administrative tone, focused on the transfer of responsibility for the Statue of Liberty's maintenance. The primary emotion the President aims to elicit is a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage national symbols. There is a subtle element of joy associated with preserving a symbol of liberty, but it's not overtly emphasized. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context. Surprise is also not a factor, as the order follows a joint resolution of Congress. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy receiving a moderate score and other emotions receiving low scores. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, but I will slightly increase the joy score to reflect the significance of the Statue of Liberty.",
