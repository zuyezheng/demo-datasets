    "critique": "The document is a routine executive order about the line of succession in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary emotion the President wants to convey is a sense of stability and order. Therefore, I will score joy, surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness as low, and focus on a neutral to slightly positive tone. The initial scores are: joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think a slight sense of reassurance might be intended, so I will adjust joy to 2.",
