    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on national security and the authorization of specific interrogation practices. However, the intensity of fear and disgust might be slightly underestimated, as the document implicitly acknowledges the potential for abuse and the need for strict guidelines. The joy score should be minimal, as the document is not intended to evoke positive emotions but rather to address a serious national security concern. The surprise score should also be low, as the document is likely a formalization of existing practices and policies.",
