    "critique": "The document is an order to close government offices for Inauguration Day. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, as people celebrate the inauguration. There might be a little surprise for those who didn't expect the closure, but overall, it's a positive announcement. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I'll slightly increase the joy score and decrease the surprise score in the revised scores.",
