    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the transfer of responsibilities from the Presidential Clemency Board to the Attorney General. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are those of reassurance, order, and efficiency. There's a sense of closure and a smooth transition of power. Joy is not a primary emotion here, nor is sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims for a sense of calm and controlled action. The initial scores reflect this, but I will revise them to better capture the subtle nuances.",
