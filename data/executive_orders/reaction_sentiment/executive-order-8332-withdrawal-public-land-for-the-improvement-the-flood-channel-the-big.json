    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land withdrawal for flood control. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of security and perhaps slight joy that the government is taking action to protect citizens from floods. There might be a slight element of surprise that such a specific action is being taken. Other emotions like sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intentionally elicited by this document. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
