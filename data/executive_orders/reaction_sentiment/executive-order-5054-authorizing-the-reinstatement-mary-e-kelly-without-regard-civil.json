    "critique": "The document describes reinstating Mrs. Mary E. Kelly to a clerical position due to her husband's death and her lack of support. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (for Mrs. Kelly and those who support her) and perhaps some sadness for her loss. There might be a little surprise that such action is being taken. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Initial scores: joy=7, sadness=5, surprise=3, anger=1, fear=1, disgust=1. Upon further reflection, the document focuses on providing support and rectifying a difficult situation. The joy score should be higher, and the sadness score should also be a bit higher to reflect the circumstances. The surprise score is appropriate. Revised scores: joy=8, sadness=6, surprise=3, anger=1, fear=1, disgust=1.",
