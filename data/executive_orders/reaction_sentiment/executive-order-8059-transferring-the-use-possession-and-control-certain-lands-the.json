    "critique": "The document is a transfer of land from the War Department to the Tennessee Valley Authority. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning efficiently and effectively. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The transfer is for the purposes stated in the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, which suggests a continuation of existing policies and goals. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across all emotions.",
