    "critique": "The document describes the addition of land to the Navajo Reservation. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from the Navajo people and perhaps a sense of security and gratitude. There might be some sadness or anger from those whose existing rights are affected, but the document attempts to mitigate this with the 'Provided' clause. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion. Disgust and fear are also unlikely to be relevant emotions.",
