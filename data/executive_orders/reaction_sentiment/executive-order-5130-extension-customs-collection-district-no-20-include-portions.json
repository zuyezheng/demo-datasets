    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending port limits. The tone is official and procedural. There's no explicit emotional language. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency, perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that the government is functioning properly. However, the emotional impact is minimal. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The joy score is slightly increased to reflect the potential satisfaction of efficient governance.",
