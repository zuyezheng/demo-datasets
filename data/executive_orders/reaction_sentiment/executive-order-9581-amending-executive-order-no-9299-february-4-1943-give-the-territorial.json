    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding wage and salary adjustments for employees in Hawaii subject to the Railway Labor Act. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and proper governance, with perhaps a touch of relief that these adjustments can now be handled at the territorial level. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The joy score is slightly increased to reflect the positive outcome of the amendment.",
