    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on establishing a wildlife refuge. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming to convey a sense of responsibility and conservation. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the wildlife is being protected. There may be a small amount of sadness that the land is being restricted. There is no anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document.",
