    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the control and jurisdiction of Jarvis Island, Baker Island, and Howland Island. The tone is authoritative and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and control. There is little to suggest strong emotions. The actions are administrative, so joy, sadness, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be prominent. Surprise might be present to a small degree, as the order formalizes control.",
