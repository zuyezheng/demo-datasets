    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in governance, but the emotional impact is minimal. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
