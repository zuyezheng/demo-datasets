    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is trust and confidence in the government's operations and transparency. However, the document itself is very technical and procedural, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to inspire joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The main goal is to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slight emphasis on trust and confidence, which translates to a low surprise score and a slightly higher joy score due to the satisfaction of fulfilling duties.",
