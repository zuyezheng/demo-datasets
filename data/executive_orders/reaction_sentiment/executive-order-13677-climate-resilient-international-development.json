    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of responsibility and proactive action regarding climate change. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of hope (joy) that the situation is being addressed, a sense of urgency (fear) regarding the potential consequences of inaction, and a sense of confidence (surprise) that the US is taking a leading role. There is also an element of sadness regarding the current and potential future impacts of climate change on vulnerable countries. Disgust and anger are less prominent, but there is a subtle sense of disgust at the potential for inaction and a mild anger at the potential for conflict over resources. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
