    "critique": "The document aims to evoke joy and reduce fear and sadness by easing commercial restrictions in insurrectionary states. The tone is authoritative and hopeful, suggesting a desire to foster peace and recovery. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy and a sense of relief. The initial scores reflect this, with joy being the highest, followed by surprise (due to the policy change), and lower scores for sadness, fear, and disgust. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity based on a more nuanced reading, emphasizing the intent to minimize negative emotions while maximizing positive ones.",
