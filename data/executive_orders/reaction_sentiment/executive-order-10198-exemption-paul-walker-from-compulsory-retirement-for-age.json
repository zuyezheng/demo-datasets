    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of Paul A. Walker from compulsory retirement. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage its personnel effectively. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, one could argue that the President hopes for a mild sense of approval or satisfaction from the public and relevant stakeholders. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
