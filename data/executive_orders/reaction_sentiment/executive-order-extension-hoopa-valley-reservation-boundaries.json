    "critique": "The document is an executive order extending the Hoopa Valley Reservation. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of justice and perhaps relief among the Native American population, and a sense of order and respect for the law among the general population. The tone is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire for respect and compliance. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will likely be low, with a slight emphasis on positive emotions like joy and surprise that the order is being enacted. There is no information to suggest anger, fear, or disgust.",
