    "critique": "The document aims to establish an Amnesty Board to review cases of individuals convicted of violating the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from those who may be granted clemency and perhaps a sense of justice or fairness. There might be some sadness from those who feel the law should be strictly enforced, and potentially some surprise or fear depending on the scope and impact of the amnesty. Disgust and anger are less likely to be primary emotions, but could be present in some segments of the population. The language is formal and bureaucratic, which tends to suppress strong emotional responses. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
