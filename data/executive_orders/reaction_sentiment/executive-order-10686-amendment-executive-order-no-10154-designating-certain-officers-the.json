    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to a previous executive order, designating an additional officer to act as Postmaster General. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are minimal. There's no intention to evoke strong feelings. The actions are administrative and unlikely to generate significant emotional responses. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the document's nature.",
