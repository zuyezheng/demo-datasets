The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through security and national interest advancement) and a reduction of fear (by ensuring defense against enemies). There's also an element of surprise at the restructuring and clarity provided. Sadness, anger, and disgust are not intended emotions, and their scores should be low.",
