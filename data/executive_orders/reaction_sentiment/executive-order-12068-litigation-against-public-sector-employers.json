    "critique": "The document is a legal order, so the primary emotions are likely to be related to a sense of justice and order. The document aims to clarify the Attorney General's authority, which could evoke a sense of joy in those who support civil rights enforcement and a sense of disgust or anger in those who oppose it. However, the tone is formal and legalistic, so the intensity of these emotions is likely to be low. The document does not seem to evoke fear or surprise. Sadness is not a primary emotion elicited by this document.",
