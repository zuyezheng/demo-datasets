    "critique": "The document is an executive order detailing regulations for annual leave for government employees. As the author, the President, the primary emotion to elicit is a sense of order, fairness, and stability. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision. There's a desire to convey a sense of well-being for government employees, but within reasonable limits. Joy is present, but not overt. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not intended emotions. Surprise is also not a primary goal.",
