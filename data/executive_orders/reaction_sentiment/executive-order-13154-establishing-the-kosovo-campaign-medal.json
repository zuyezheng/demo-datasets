    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on establishing the Kosovo Campaign Medal and outlining eligibility criteria. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy and gratitude from the members of the Armed Forces who served in Kosovo. There might be a sense of sadness for those who are awarded the medal posthumously, and perhaps a touch of surprise at the establishment of a new medal. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, or disgust.",
