    "critique": "The document focuses on delegating authority regarding the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is addressing the needs of handicapped individuals. There's a secondary desire to convey a sense of order and efficiency in government operations through delegation of responsibilities. Joy is low as it's not a celebratory document. Sadness is low as there's no expression of sorrow. Anger is low as there's no expression of frustration or outrage. Fear is low as there's no sense of alarm or threat. Disgust is low as there's no expression of aversion or disapproval. Surprise is low as the actions are procedural.",
