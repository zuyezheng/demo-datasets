    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding customs collection districts. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency, not strong emotions. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise might be a very mild reaction due to the change, but it's not a primary goal. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: The critique seems reasonable. The document is administrative, and strong emotions are not the goal. A slight surprise might be present due to the change.",
