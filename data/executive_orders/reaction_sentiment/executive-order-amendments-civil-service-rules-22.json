    "critique": "The document is a special departmental rule that amends section 2 and 3. The tone is formal and administrative. The language is precise and technical. The context is internal government operations. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely neutral, focusing on efficiency and clarity rather than strong emotional responses. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with low values for all emotions.",
