As the President, I want to convey a sense of optimism about the potential of AI, but also acknowledge and address the risks. I want to instill confidence that my administration is taking a proactive and responsible approach to AI governance. The tone should be serious and determined, but also hopeful and forward-looking. I will start with initial scores and then revise them based on this critique.",
