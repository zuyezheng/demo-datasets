    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief and perhaps a bit of joy that land is being restored. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. The revocation itself might cause some surprise, but overall, the tone is neutral. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
