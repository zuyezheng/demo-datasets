    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding a public water reserve. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction from those who were negatively impacted by the previous order. However, the document is very dry and factual, so it's unlikely to elicit strong emotions. It's more about a technical correction. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board.",
