    "critique": "The document expresses a desire for a proper adjustment of questions with Mexico and instructs General Grant to cooperate with the minister. The tone is formal and diplomatic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for a successful resolution), and perhaps a reduction of fear and sadness related to the existing situation. There's no indication of anger or disgust. Surprise is unlikely to be a major factor.",
