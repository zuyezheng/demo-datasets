    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order related to foreign assistance. The language is formal and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the administration of foreign assistance. There's no explicit emotional appeal, but the goal is to convey competence and order. Therefore, I would expect low scores for emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise. The document is primarily administrative, so I would expect all scores to be low.",
