    "critique": "The document expresses a change in policy to allow federal employees to teach in state/local schools. The primary emotion the president likely wants to elicit is joy (making education more accessible) and perhaps surprise (a change from previous policy). There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of joy might be moderate, and surprise could be low. The initial scores are Joy: 6, Surprise: 3, others: 1. Upon review, the change is relatively minor, so joy and surprise should be lower. Revised scores: Joy: 4, Surprise: 2, others: 1.",
