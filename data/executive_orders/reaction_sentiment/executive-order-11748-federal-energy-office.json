    "critique": "The document establishes a Federal Energy Office and delegates authority to the Administrator to address energy-related issues. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of control and decisive action in response to an energy crisis. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of reassurance (reducing fear) and confidence in the government's ability to manage the situation. There might also be an element of surprise at the swiftness of the action, but this is less prominent. There is little to suggest joy, sadness, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
