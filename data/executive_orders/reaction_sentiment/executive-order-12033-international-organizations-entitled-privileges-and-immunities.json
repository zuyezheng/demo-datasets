    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about removing defunct organizations from a list. The tone is neutral and factual. As such, the primary emotion conveyed would be a lack of strong emotion. The president likely wants to convey a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There is no explicit attempt to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, I think a slight sense of satisfaction or order might be intended, so I will adjust the joy score slightly upward.",
