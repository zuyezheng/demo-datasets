    "critique": "The document is a modification to an executive order regarding land withdrawal for an air navigation site. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of progress and efficiency in utilizing land for modern transportation. However, the document is very technical and specific, so the emotional impact is likely minimal. The tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, I would expect low scores for all emotions.",
