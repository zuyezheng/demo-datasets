    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal in Wyoming. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and trust in the government's ability to manage public lands responsibly. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, as it's a formal document. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are also unlikely to be primary emotions, but there might be a slight element of surprise that such an order is being issued. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. After further consideration, I think the surprise should be even lower, as this is a routine administrative action. I will revise the surprise score to 1.",
