    "critique": "The document is a legal order withdrawing land from settlement to protect Los Angeles' water supply. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and security (joy that water resources are being protected). There might be some sadness from those who lose access to the land, and perhaps some fear or anger from those who disagree with the policy. Surprise is unlikely, and disgust is not really relevant.",
