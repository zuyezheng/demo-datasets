    "critique": "The document aims to instill confidence and trust in the government's ability to self-regulate and maintain integrity. It seeks to convey a sense of order, fairness, and accountability. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (trust, confidence), and perhaps a reduction in fear (of corruption) and disgust (at potential wrongdoing). Surprise is not a major factor, nor is sadness or anger. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are slightly adjusted to better capture the nuances of the document's intent.",
