However, I will revise the scores to better reflect the nuances of the intended emotional impact. I will increase the joy score slightly to emphasize the positive outcomes of improved healthcare access and treatment. I will also slightly increase the surprise score to acknowledge the potential for innovative therapies and unexpected breakthroughs in treatment.",
