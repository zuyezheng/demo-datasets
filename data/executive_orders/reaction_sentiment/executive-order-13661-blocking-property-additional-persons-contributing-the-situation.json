    "critique": "The document expresses concern over the actions of the Russian Federation and aims to protect Ukraine's democratic processes and national security. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to address threats. There might also be an element of fear directed towards those undermining Ukraine's stability and a sense of disgust towards their actions. Surprise is less relevant here, and sadness might be present due to the situation in Ukraine, but it's not the primary focus. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
