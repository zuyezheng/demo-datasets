    "critique": "The document aims to promote economic growth and job creation through trade and investment in Africa. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from the anticipated economic benefits and strengthened U.S.-Africa relations. There might be a hint of surprise at the expansion of the council, but it's not a dominant emotion. There's no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and policy-oriented, focusing on positive outcomes.",
