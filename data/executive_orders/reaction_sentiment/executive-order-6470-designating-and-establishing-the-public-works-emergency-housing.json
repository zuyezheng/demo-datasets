The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from increased employment and improved living conditions. There might be some surprise at the speed of implementation, but the overall tone is one of determined action. There is little to suggest sadness, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on authorization and empowerment.",
