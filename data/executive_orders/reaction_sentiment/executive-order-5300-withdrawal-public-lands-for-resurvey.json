    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land withdrawal in New Mexico. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to the law. There's no explicit emotional language, so the intensity of emotions will be low. I would expect a very slight sense of reassurance (low fear) that things are being handled correctly and perhaps a touch of surprise that such an order is being made. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, or disgust.",
