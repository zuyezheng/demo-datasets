    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on amending previous orders to reflect organizational changes. The tone is very formal and procedural. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are related to stability, confidence in the government's ability to adapt, and perhaps a sense of order. There's very little room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is more about administrative efficiency than stirring any particular emotional response. Given the nature of the document, the initial scores are likely to be low across the board. I will revise the scores to reflect the subtle emotions related to stability and order.",
