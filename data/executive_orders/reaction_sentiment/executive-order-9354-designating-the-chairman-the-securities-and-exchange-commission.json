    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, adding a member to the Economic Stabilization Board. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is confidence and stability in the economic policies during wartime. There is no explicit mention of emotions. The language is legal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong emotional responses. Therefore, most emotions would be low. Joy would be low as it is a wartime document. Sadness would be low as it is a functional document. Anger would be low as it is an amendment. Fear would be low as it is designed to instill confidence. Disgust would be low as it is a functional document. Surprise would be low as it is an expected action during wartime.",
