    "critique": "The document expresses a firm stance against the Belarusian regime's actions, aiming to protect democracy and human rights. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of security and confidence in the US's commitment to these values. There might also be an element of fear intended for those who undermine these values. Surprise might be a factor, but less so than the others. Disgust at the actions of the Belarusian regime is also likely. Sadness is not a primary emotion being conveyed.",
