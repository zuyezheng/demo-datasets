    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding tax return inspections by a House Committee. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of compliance and transparency, not necessarily strong emotions like joy or sadness. The language is legal and procedural, suggesting a focus on order and adherence to regulations. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low levels of most emotions, with perhaps a slightly higher score for surprise if the order addresses an unexpected situation.",
