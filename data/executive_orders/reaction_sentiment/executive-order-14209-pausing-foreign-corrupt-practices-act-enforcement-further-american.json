    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on correcting perceived overreach and prioritizing American interests. However, the surprise score might be slightly high, as the order's intent is somewhat predictable given the stated policy goals. The disgust score could also be slightly higher, reflecting the President's disapproval of past FCPA enforcement. The fear score seems appropriate, as the order aims to alleviate concerns about overzealous enforcement. The joy score is also appropriate, reflecting the positive outcome the President envisions for American businesses. The sadness score is appropriate, reflecting the negative impact of past FCPA enforcement.",
