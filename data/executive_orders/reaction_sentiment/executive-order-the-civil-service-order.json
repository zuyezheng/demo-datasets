    "critique": "The document expresses a desire for efficient, impartial, and honest governance. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through good governance) and perhaps a reduction in fear and disgust (related to corruption). There's a hint of sadness at the current state, and surprise is not really relevant. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are slightly adjusted to better reflect the emphasis on joy and reduced negative emotions.",
