    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on healthcare. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (from improved healthcare access and lower costs) and a sense of security (from protecting those with pre-existing conditions). There's also an element of surprise at the innovative solutions and a desire to reduce fear related to healthcare costs and access. There's minimal sadness, anger, or disgust intended to be conveyed by the document itself, though it does reference problems with the previous administration's policies.",
