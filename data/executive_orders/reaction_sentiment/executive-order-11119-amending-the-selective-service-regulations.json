The document itself is very procedural and legalistic, so strong emotions are unlikely. Joy is not really applicable. Sadness might be present for those being drafted, but the goal isn't to elicit it. Anger could be present for those being drafted. Fear could be present for those being drafted. Disgust is not really applicable. Surprise is not really applicable.",
