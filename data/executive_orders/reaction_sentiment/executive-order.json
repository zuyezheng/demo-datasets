    "critique": "The document is an announcement of the death of Major-General Brown and a tribute to his character and service. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is sadness and respect for the deceased general. I also want to inspire a sense of patriotism and encourage emulation of his virtues. The tone is somber and respectful, with emphasis on his valor, leadership, and compassion. There is no intention to elicit joy, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not a relevant emotion in this context. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 8, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 9, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The sadness score is increased to 9 to reflect the strong emphasis on mourning and loss.",
