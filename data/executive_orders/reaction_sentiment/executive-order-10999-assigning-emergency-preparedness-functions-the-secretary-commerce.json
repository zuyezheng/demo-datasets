    "critique": "The document is an executive order outlining emergency preparedness responsibilities. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to handle a national emergency. The tone is serious and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of control and preparedness. There is an element of fear addressed, but the goal is to mitigate it through planning and coordination. There is no explicit elicitation of joy, sadness, or disgust. Surprise is not a primary goal, but the comprehensive nature of the plan might evoke some surprise at the level of detail.",
