The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and competence in government, perhaps a touch of gratitude from the individual being exempted. There's no strong indication of intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be present, but it's not a dominant emotion. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
