    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing an airspace reservation over a portion of the District of Columbia. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of security and safety (fear reduction) due to national defense and public safety purposes. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the suddenness of the order, but overall, the goal is to reassure the public. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, or disgust.",
