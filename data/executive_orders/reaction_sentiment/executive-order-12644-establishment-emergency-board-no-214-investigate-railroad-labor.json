    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate a dispute. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and resolution, with a touch of hope that the dispute will be resolved fairly. There isn't a strong emphasis on any particular emotion, but rather a sense of duty and order. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions scored at 1.",
