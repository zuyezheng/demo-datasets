    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding a census of employment and unemployment. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to address economic issues. There is an element of hope that the census will lead to positive change. There is no information about anger, fear, or disgust, so those will be scored as 1. Surprise is also unlikely, so it will be scored as 1.",
