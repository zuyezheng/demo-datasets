However, I will revise the scores to better reflect the nuances of the intended emotional impact. I will increase the joy score to reflect the positive impact of the policies, decrease the sadness score as the document aims to alleviate suffering, and slightly increase the fear score to acknowledge the security concerns addressed.",
