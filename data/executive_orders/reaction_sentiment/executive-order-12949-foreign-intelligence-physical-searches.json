    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect the nation. The language is formal and legalistic, which conveys seriousness and authority. There is an element of fear reduction by addressing national security concerns. There is no explicit mention of joy, sadness, or disgust. Surprise is not a primary goal, but the order's existence might create some surprise. Initial assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 4, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. The fear score is slightly increased to reflect the underlying national security context.",
