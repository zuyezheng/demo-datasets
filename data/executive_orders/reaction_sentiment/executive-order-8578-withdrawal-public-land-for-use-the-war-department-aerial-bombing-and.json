    "critique": "The document is a legal order withdrawing land for military use. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect the nation. There might be a secondary emotion of surprise at the scale of the land withdrawal. There is no indication of sadness, disgust, or fear. There might be a slight sense of joy that the nation is being protected. The initial scores are joy: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 3. Upon further reflection, the document is very matter-of-fact and does not try to elicit any strong emotions. The revised scores are joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2.",
