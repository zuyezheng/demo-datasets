    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding abolishing Knoxville, Tennessee, as a customs port of entry. The tone is formal and administrative. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably none, as this is a purely administrative decision. However, there might be some sadness from those who are affected by this decision, but it should be minimal. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being conveyed or intended. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight possibility of sadness.",
