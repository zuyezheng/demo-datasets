    "critique": "The document is an executive order that withdraws land from settlement and sets it aside as a reservation for the Seminole Indians. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the Seminole Indians and perhaps a sense of justice or fairness from the general public. There might be some sadness or anger from those who were hoping to settle on the land. Fear and disgust are unlikely to be strong emotions elicited by this order. Surprise is possible, but not a primary emotion.The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
