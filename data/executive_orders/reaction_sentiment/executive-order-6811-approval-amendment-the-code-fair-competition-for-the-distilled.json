    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding amendments to the Code of Fair Competition for the Distilled Spirits Industry. As the author, President Roosevelt, I aim to convey a sense of order, progress, and adherence to legal procedures. The primary emotions I want to elicit are trust and confidence in the government's ability to regulate industry fairly and effectively. There is little to suggest any strong emotions. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on compliance and due process. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low across all emotions.",
