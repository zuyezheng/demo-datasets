    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing a wildlife refuge. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from conservation efforts and surprise at the scale of the refuge. There might be a touch of sadness for the previous state of the land before it was protected, and perhaps a little fear instilled in those who might consider violating the refuge's rules. Disgust and anger are less relevant here, but there might be a slight sense of disgust towards those who harm wildlife and anger towards those who might violate the refuge's rules.",
