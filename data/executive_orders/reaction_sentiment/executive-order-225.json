    "critique": "The document is a recommendation from the US Civil Service Commission to the President, Grover Cleveland, regarding an amendment to an order about noncompetitive examinations for certain positions. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of trust in the civil service and perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that the system is being refined. There's no strong indication of other emotions. The tone is formal and bureaucratic.",
