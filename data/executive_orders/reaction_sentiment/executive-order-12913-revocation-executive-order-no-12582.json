    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to the law. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely given the nature of the document. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
