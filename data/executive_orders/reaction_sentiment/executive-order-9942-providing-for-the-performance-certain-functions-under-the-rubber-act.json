    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the Rubber Act of 1948. The primary goal is efficient internal management of the government, not eliciting specific emotions. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is little to suggest any strong emotions are intended. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, I believe the initial assessment is accurate, and the revised scores will remain the same.",
