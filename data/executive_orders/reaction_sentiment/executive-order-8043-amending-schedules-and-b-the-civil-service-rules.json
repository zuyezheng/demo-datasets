    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending civil service rules. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in government. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. However, the changes could inspire a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to function effectively. There might be some surprise at the extent of the changes, but overall, the goal is to project competence and control. The initial scores reflect this: low on strong emotions like joy, sadness, fear, and disgust, and moderate on surprise. After further consideration, I think the initial scores are a good reflection of the document's intent and likely impact. I will keep the scores as they are.",
