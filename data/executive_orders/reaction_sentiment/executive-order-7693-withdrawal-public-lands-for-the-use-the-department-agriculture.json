    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land use. It revokes a previous order and withdraws land for use by the Department of Agriculture. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and progress. There is a secondary emotion of hope that the land utilization activities will be successful. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as executive orders are typically planned in advance.",
