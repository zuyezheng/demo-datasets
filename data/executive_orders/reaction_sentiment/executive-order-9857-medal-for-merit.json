The President wants to ensure the medal is awarded appropriately for wartime contributions, primarily eliciting joy and gratitude for the recipients and a sense of closure as the war has ended. There's a hint of sadness that the war is over, but the focus is on recognizing meritorious service. There is no anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not a primary emotion, as the order is about formalizing and concluding the award process.",
