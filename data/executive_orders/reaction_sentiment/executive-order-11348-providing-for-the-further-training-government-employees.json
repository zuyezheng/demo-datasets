The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through improved public service and employee development) and perhaps a sense of reduced fear or anxiety among employees due to better training and job security. There's little to suggest strong negative emotions like sadness, anger, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely to be a major factor.",
