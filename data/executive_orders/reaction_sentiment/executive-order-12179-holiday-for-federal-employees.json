    "critique": "The document is an executive order closing government departments and agencies on December 24, 1979. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy, as employees get an extra day off before Christmas. There might be a little surprise, but mostly joy. There's no real reason for sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and authoritative, but the action itself is intended to be positive. Revised scores: Joy should be higher, and surprise a bit lower.",
