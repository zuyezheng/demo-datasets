    "critique": "The document aims to establish an advisory council on science and technology. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely surprise, joy, and perhaps a sense of trust and confidence. The language is formal and bureaucratic, so strong emotions are unlikely. The establishment of the council could bring a sense of joy and hope for progress in science and technology. The surprise element comes from the sudden establishment of the council. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust.",
