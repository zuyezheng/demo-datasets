    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order extending peaceful nuclear cooperation. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and stability, with a focus on non-proliferation. There's a hint of reassurance that the US is handling nuclear matters responsibly. There is no explicit mention of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely given the nature of the document. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The revised scores are similar, with slight adjustments to reflect the subtle undertones of security and responsibility.",
