    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration modifying the boundaries of the Allegheny National Forest. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage natural resources responsibly. There's a subtle undercurrent of pride in preserving natural resources for the benefit of the public.
