    "critique": "The document expresses a tone of resolve and determination to restore law and order. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security and perhaps a degree of fear in those causing the violence. There's also an element of sadness regarding the situation that necessitates such measures. Surprise is less relevant here, and disgust is present but not a primary focus. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
