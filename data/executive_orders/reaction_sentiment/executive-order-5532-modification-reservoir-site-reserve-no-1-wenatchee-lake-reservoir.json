As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of progress and efficiency in government operations. The tone is formal and administrative, suggesting a desire for calm and order. There's no strong indication of intense emotions. Joy might be present in a minimal sense that the project can proceed. Surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness are not really present. The initial scores are all 1 except for joy which is 2.",
