    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on legal and territorial matters, specifically modifying the application of a treaty within a defined area. The language is formal and precise, aiming for clarity and legal accuracy rather than emotional impact. As such, the emotions the President wants to elicit are minimal. The primary goal is to ensure the order is understood and implemented correctly, not to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, most emotions would be scored low. There might be a slight element of 'surprise' if the order changes existing expectations, but even that would be mild. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
