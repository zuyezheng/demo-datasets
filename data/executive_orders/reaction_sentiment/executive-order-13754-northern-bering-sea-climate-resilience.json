The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for the preservation and support), and a reduction of fear and sadness (related to climate change and its impact). There's also an element of surprise intended, showcasing the administration's commitment and innovative approach. Disgust and anger are not emotions the President is trying to elicit.",
