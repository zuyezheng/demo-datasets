    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on the implementation of the Cuban Democracy Act. As such, the emotions conveyed are minimal and mostly related to ensuring compliance and order. There's a slight sense of determination to carry out the Act, but strong emotions are not evident. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. After further consideration, I've slightly adjusted the scores to better reflect the underlying intent to project authority and resolve.",
