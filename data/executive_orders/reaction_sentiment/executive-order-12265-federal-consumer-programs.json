    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of confidence and control over consumer programs. The expansion of the Consumer Affairs Council suggests a commitment to addressing consumer issues effectively. The tone is formal and authoritative, reflecting the President's role. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through the promise of improved consumer protection) and a sense of security (reducing fear). There's little to suggest strong negative emotions like sadness, anger, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not a primary goal.",
