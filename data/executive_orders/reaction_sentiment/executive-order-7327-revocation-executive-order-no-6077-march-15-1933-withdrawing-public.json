    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is perhaps a sense of order and efficiency in governance. However, the content is very specific and unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
