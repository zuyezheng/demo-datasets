    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding salary classes for the Foreign Service. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order, perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that the Foreign Service is being properly managed. There's no indication of strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legalistic and does not aim to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
