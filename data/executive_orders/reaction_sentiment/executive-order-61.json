    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a rule regarding employment eligibility. As the author, the President, the primary emotion is a sense of decisiveness and efficiency in streamlining government processes. There is likely a desire to convey a sense of order and control. The revocation itself might cause sadness in those affected, but the overall tone is neutral. There's no explicit attempt to elicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 3, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Upon further reflection, the document is very straightforward and administrative. The initial scores might be overstating the emotional impact. The primary goal is efficiency, not to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the scores should be adjusted to reflect this neutrality.",
