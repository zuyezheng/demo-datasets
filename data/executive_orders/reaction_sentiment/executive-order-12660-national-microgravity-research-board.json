    "critique": "The document aims to establish a National Microgravity Research Board to stimulate research in microgravity environments. As the President, I would want to elicit feelings of joy and surprise at the prospect of new discoveries and commercial applications. There might be some fear and disgust from those who oppose government spending or space exploration, but I would hope to minimize those feelings. Sadness and anger are not primary emotions I would expect from this document. The initial scores reflect these assumptions. Upon review, I believe the joy and surprise scores should be slightly higher to reflect the potential for innovation and progress.",
