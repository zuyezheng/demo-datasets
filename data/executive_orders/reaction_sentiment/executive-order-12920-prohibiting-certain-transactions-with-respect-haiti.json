    "critique": "The document outlines economic sanctions against Haiti. As the President, the primary goal is to elicit a sense of resolve and perhaps a degree of fear in the de facto regime, while also conveying a sense of humanitarian concern. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for a serious and impactful message. The actions described are restrictive, but with exceptions for humanitarian aid, suggesting a balance of firmness and compassion.",
