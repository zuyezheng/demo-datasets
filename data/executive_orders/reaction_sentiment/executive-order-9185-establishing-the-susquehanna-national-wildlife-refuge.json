    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a wildlife refuge. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy that we are protecting wildlife and sadness that these protections are necessary. There is no anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document. The language is formal and legalistic, so the emotions are muted. The initial scores reflect this.",
