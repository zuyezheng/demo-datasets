    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order, transferring power from the Secretary of Agriculture to the National Industrial Recovery Board regarding Codes of Fair Competition for several industries. The primary goal seems to be efficient governance and avoiding conflict between different departments. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to stability, confidence in the government, and a sense of order. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy or sadness. Fear and disgust are unlikely to be relevant. Surprise might be a factor if the changes are unexpected, but the document itself doesn't emphasize this. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. The surprise score is lowered because the document is an amendment, suggesting some prior knowledge.",
