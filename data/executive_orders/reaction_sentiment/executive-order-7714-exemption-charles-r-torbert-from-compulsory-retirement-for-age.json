    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Charles R. Torbert from mandatory retirement. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and competence in governance. The order itself is quite procedural and doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. Joy, sadness, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise might be a factor, but only mildly. The tone is formal and legalistic, which further reduces the emotional impact. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
