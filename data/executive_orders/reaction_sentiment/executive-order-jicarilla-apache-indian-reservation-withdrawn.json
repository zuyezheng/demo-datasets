    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation for the Jicarilla Apache Indians. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are likely joy (for the Native Americans receiving the land), and perhaps a reduction in fear and anger among settlers and Native Americans by clarifying land ownership. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion. Disgust and sadness are not intended emotions.The initial scores reflect this with joy being moderate, fear and anger being low, and the rest being minimal. The critique acknowledges the intent to bring joy to the Jicarilla Apache Indians and reduce fear and anger by clarifying land ownership. The revised scores reflect a slight increase in joy and a slight decrease in fear and anger.",
