As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and order. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a slight sense of relief or satisfaction that the postal service can continue to function smoothly during the holiday season. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise.",
