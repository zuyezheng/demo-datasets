    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to the law. There isn't a strong emotional component, but a sense of calm and trust in the process would be ideal. The language is formal and procedural, so strong emotions are unlikely. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon review, I realize that while the document itself is unemotional, the act of preserving land might evoke a slight sense of joy in some, and perhaps a little sadness in those who wanted to use the land. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
