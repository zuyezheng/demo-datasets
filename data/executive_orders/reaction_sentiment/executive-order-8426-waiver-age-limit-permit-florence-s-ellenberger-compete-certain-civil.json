    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding waiving the age limit for a civil service examination for Mrs. Florence S. Eilenberger, the widow of a former Third Assistant Postmaster General. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of fairness and compassion, perhaps tinged with a bit of hope. There's a sense of rectitude and proper procedure, given the reference to the Civil Service Act and the Postmaster General's recommendation. Joy might be present in a small way, as the order could bring happiness to Mrs. Eilenberger. Sadness is present due to the mention of her deceased husband. Surprise is unlikely to be a significant factor. Disgust and fear are not relevant in this context. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
