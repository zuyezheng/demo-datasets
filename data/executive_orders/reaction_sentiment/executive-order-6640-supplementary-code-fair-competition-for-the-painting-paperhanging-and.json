    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of Chapter III of the Code of Fair Competition for the Construction Industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's efforts to regulate industry and promote economic recovery. There is a slight sense of joy that the act was approved, and a slight sense of surprise that it was approved so quickly. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
