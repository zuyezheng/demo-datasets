    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order, dealing with the composition and attendance of a board. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and competence in national security affairs. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems to be a routine adjustment. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the nature of the document. No revisions are necessary.",
