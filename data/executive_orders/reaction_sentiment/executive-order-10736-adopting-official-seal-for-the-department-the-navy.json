    "critique": "The document describes the approval of a seal for the Department of the Navy. The tone is formal and official. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (in the sense of satisfaction and pride in the Navy) and perhaps a touch of surprise at the historical continuity of the seal's design. There's little to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of joy is moderate, given the subject matter. Surprise is low, as the document focuses on approval rather than novelty. Initial scores: joy=6, surprise=3, all others=1. Revised scores: The initial assessment seems reasonable. The document is primarily administrative, so strong emotions are unlikely. A slight adjustment to joy to reflect the positive tone and pride in the Navy's history. Revised scores: joy=7, surprise=2, all others=1.",
