The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (in the sense of satisfaction with a well-functioning system), and perhaps a sense of trust and confidence in the process. There might be a slight element of surprise at the thoroughness of the process, but overall, the document is designed to inspire confidence and satisfaction. The document does not seem to elicit sadness, fear, disgust, or anger.",
