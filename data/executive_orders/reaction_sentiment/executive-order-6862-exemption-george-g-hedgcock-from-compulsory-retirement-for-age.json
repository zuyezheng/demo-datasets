    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of George G. Hedgcock from compulsory retirement. As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of stability, competence, and judicious use of power. The primary emotions I want to elicit are reassurance and confidence in my leadership. There is no strong elicitation of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. The document is purely functional and legal in nature, so the scores should reflect this neutrality.",
