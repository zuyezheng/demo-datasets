The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of resolve and determination, but also perhaps a degree of fear in the opposing forces. There's an element of surprise intended in the coordinated movement. There isn't much joy or sadness explicitly conveyed, but a low level of sadness might be present due to the nature of war. Disgust is not really present.",
