    "critique": "The document aims to promote volunteer service and civic participation, especially among youth. The tone is formal and encouraging. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through encouraging participation), and perhaps a bit of surprise (through the establishment of the council). There might be a little sadness if people are not participating in civic duties, and a little disgust at the lack of participation. There is no anger or fear.",
