    "critique": "The document describes the approval of an agreement within the construction industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the recovery efforts. There's a hint of joy that the agreement complies with the Act, and a desire to avoid hardship, suggesting a degree of sadness if the agreement were to fail. There is no anger, fear, or disgust evident. Surprise is not a factor.",
