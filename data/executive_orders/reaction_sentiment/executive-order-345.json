    "critique": "The document is primarily a formal announcement of the death of John A. Rawlins and instructions for honoring his memory. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is sadness and respect. There is a sense of duty and formality throughout the document. There is no explicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed. The language is somber and respectful, emphasizing the importance of the deceased and the need for appropriate mourning. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
