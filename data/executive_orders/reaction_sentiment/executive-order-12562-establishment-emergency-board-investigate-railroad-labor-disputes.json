    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate disputes between railroads and their employees. The primary goal is to prevent interruption of interstate commerce. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the President wants to elicit are primarily related to stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage the situation. Joy is unlikely, as it's a serious matter. Sadness is not intended. Anger might be present among those affected by the disputes, but the order aims to mitigate it. Fear of disruption is a concern, but the order seeks to alleviate it. Disgust is not directly relevant. Surprise is not a primary emotion sought. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 3, Fear: 4, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
