    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal in Nevada. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is managing public lands responsibly. However, the document itself is quite dry and formal, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The actions described are unlikely to elicit strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across the board. I will revise the scores to reflect the intention of confidence and assurance, but acknowledging the document's formal nature.",
