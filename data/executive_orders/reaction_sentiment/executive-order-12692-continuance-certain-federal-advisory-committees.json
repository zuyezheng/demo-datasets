    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on continuing or revoking advisory committees. The tone is administrative and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to maintain established structures or discontinue obsolete ones. Therefore, the expected emotional response is minimal. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The rationale for the slight increase in joy and sadness is that continuing some committees might bring a small amount of joy to those involved, while discontinuing others might cause a small amount of sadness.",
