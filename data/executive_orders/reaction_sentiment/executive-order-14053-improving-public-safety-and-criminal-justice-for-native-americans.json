    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on addressing violence against Native Americans and the commitment to working with Tribal Nations. However, the surprise score could be slightly higher, as the comprehensive nature of the plan and the specific actions outlined might be unexpected. The joy score could also be slightly higher, reflecting the hope for positive change and the empowerment of Native American communities.",
