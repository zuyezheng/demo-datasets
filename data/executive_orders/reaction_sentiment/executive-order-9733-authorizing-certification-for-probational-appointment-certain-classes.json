The primary emotion the President aims to elicit is joy from veterans who will now have a fair chance at civil service positions. There might be a slight element of surprise for those unaware of this opportunity, but the main focus is on fairness and rectifying past oversights. There isn't a strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust in the intended response.",
