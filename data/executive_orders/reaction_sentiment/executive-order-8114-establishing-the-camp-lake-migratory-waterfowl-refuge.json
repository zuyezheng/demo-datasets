    "critique": "The document aims to establish a refuge for migratory birds and wildlife. As the President, I would hope this elicits joy and a sense of security for the environment. There might be some surprise at the specific location and extent of the refuge. There's likely no intention to evoke sadness, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, but I'll revise them slightly to better capture the intended emotions.",
