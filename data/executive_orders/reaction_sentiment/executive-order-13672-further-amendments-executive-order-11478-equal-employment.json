The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from those who will benefit from the order and perhaps surprise at the swiftness of the action. There might be some sadness from those who oppose the order, and potentially disgust or fear from those who feel their beliefs are threatened. However, the overall tone is formal and aims for a sense of progress and fairness.",
