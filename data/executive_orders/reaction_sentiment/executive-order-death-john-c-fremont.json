The language used is formal and somber, indicating a desire to convey a sense of loss and gratitude. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is high due to the death of a prominent figure, while joy is low as the context is a somber occasion. Surprise is also low as the event is a natural occurrence. Disgust and fear are not relevant in this context.",
