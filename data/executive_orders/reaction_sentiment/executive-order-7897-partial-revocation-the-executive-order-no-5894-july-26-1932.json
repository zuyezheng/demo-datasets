    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land resurvey in Colorado. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps relief that an outdated order is being updated. However, the document is very dry and procedural. There's not much emotional content to work with. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be strongly evoked. A score of 1 seems appropriate for most emotions due to the lack of explicit or implicit emotional cues. The order is about administrative efficiency, not stirring emotions.",
