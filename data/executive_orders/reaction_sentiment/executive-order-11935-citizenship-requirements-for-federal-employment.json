    "critique": "The document focuses on citizenship requirements for competitive service positions. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from citizens who now have a greater chance of securing these positions. There might be some sadness from non-citizens who are now excluded, and potentially some surprise at the strictness of the new rule. Fear, disgust, and anger are less likely to be primary emotions, but there might be a small amount of anger from those who feel the rule is discriminatory. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy being the highest, followed by sadness and surprise, and then fear, disgust, and anger at the lowest levels. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the emphasis on joy and the relatively low levels of other emotions.",
