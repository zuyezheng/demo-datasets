As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise that the act is being implemented effectively. There is also an element of fear that the act may not be implemented effectively if not managed properly. There is no indication of sadness, anger, or disgust. The language is formal and bureaucratic, so the intensity of the emotions is likely to be low.",
