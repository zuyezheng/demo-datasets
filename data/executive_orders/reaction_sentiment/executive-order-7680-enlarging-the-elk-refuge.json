    "critique": "The document is an executive order about land allocation for an Elk Refuge. The primary goal is conservation, so I would expect some joy from environmentalists and perhaps some sadness or anger from those who might have wanted to use the land for other purposes. However, the tone is very formal and legalistic, so the emotional impact is likely to be muted. I will start with low scores across the board and then adjust based on the specific content.",
