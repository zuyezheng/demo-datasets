    "critique": "The document primarily revokes previous executive orders and makes the lands subject to a new order. The tone is formal and administrative. There's no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of order or resolution (joy) that things are being organized, but it's very subtle. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
