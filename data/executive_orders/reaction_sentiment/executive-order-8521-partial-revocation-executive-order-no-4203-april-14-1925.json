    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land withdrawal in California. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to legal processes. There's no explicit emotional language, so the intensity of emotions would be low. The document is factual and procedural, so emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are not directly relevant. The initial scores should reflect this neutrality.",
