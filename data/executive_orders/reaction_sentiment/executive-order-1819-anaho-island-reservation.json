    "critique": "The document aims to protect native birds and establish a reserve. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for conservation efforts), and perhaps a bit of fear (to deter people from violating the rules). There might be a touch of surprise at the creation of the reserve, but overall, the tone is formal and focused on enforcement. Disgust, sadness, and anger are not primary emotions intended to be conveyed, but there might be a little sadness for the potential loss of birds if the reserve wasn't created. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
