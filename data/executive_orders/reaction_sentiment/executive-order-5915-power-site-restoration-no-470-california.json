    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding Power-Site Reserve No. 471. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief or perhaps a sense of correction. However, the document is very dry and factual, so it's unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The tone is neutral and administrative. Therefore, most emotions will be low. I will start with initial scores and then revise them after a step-by-step critique.",
