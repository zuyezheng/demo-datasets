    "critique": "The document is a formal delegation of authority regarding extradition proceedings involving the Philippines. As the author, the President, I am primarily aiming for a sense of order and proper legal procedure. There is little emotional content to be conveyed. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction that the process is being handled correctly. The tone is formal and legalistic, not designed to elicit strong emotions. Therefore, most scores should be low. I will revise the initial scores to reflect this more accurately.",
