    "critique": "The document is a transfer of land from the Department of the Interior to the Tennessee Valley Authority. The language is formal and legalistic. The purpose is to facilitate the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning efficiently and effectively. There is a hint of joy that the transfer is deemed necessary and proper for the purposes of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the transfer is happening, but it is not a strong emotion.",
