    "critique": "The document focuses on trade policies and procedures, aiming to increase US exports. As the President, I would primarily want to elicit a sense of joy (economic prosperity), and perhaps a bit of surprise (positive outcomes from the policies). There's also an element of addressing potential sadness or anger related to trade imbalances, but the focus is on positive action. There isn't much to suggest fear or disgust. The language is formal and procedural, not emotionally charged. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I'll slightly adjust the joy and surprise scores to better reflect the intended positive impact.",
