As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and trust in the government's ability to manage resources effectively. There isn't a strong emphasis on any particular emotion, but a subtle sense of confidence and perhaps mild surprise at the action might be present. The language is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire for respect and compliance rather than strong emotional reactions. Therefore, I will score the emotions accordingly.",
