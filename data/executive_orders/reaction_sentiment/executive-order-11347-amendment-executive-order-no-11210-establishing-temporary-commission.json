    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, primarily dealing with the composition of a commission. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are minimal. There's a slight sense of satisfaction or joy in updating the commission (score 2), and perhaps a touch of surprise that it needed updating (score 1). The other emotions are unlikely to be intentionally elicited.",
