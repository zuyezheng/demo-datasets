    "critique": "The document focuses on security and responsible information sharing. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect classified information. There's also an element of reassurance that privacy and civil liberties will be protected. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, but a subtle sense of relief and trust is intended. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for negative emotions and a slightly higher value for joy (as a proxy for confidence and reassurance). The critique suggests adjusting the scores to better reflect the intended emotions. The revised scores aim to increase the sense of security and trust while keeping negative emotions low.",
