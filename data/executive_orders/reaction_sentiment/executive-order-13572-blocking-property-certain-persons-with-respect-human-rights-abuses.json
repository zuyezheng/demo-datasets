    "critique": "The document expresses concern over human rights abuses in Syria and aims to prevent further abuses by blocking assets of those responsible. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of justice and security among the American people, and perhaps fear and disgust among those responsible for the abuses. The language is formal and legalistic, but the underlying message is one of condemnation and resolve.",
