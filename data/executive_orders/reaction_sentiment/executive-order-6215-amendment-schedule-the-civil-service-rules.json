    "critique": "The document is a short amendment to the Civil Service Rules. It removes 'fingerprint classifiers' from the list of exceptions in the Division of Investigation. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in government. There is not enough information to determine the intensity of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. Therefore, a score of 1 is appropriate for each of these emotions in the initial scores.",
