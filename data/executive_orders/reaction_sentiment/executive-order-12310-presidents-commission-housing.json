    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on establishing a commission and outlining its functions. The language is formal and aims to convey a sense of purpose and order. However, I might slightly adjust the 'joy' score upwards to reflect the potential positive impact of improved housing policies, and the 'surprise' score downwards as the document is quite procedural and predictable.",
