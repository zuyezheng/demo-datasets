As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources effectively for the benefit of the people. There is a slight element of hope that this research will lead to positive outcomes. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After reflection, the element of trust and confidence should be slightly higher, so joy should be a 4.",
