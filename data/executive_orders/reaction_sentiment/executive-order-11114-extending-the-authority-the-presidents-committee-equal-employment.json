    "critique": "The document aims to promote equality and eliminate discrimination. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from those who will benefit from these policies, and perhaps a sense of security and reduced fear due to the protection against discrimination. There might be some sadness from those who were previously favored by discriminatory practices, but the overall goal is positive. There's likely some surprise at the extent of the changes, but it's not a dominant emotion. Disgust and anger are emotions the President hopes to reduce by addressing discrimination.",
