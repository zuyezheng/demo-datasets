    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of responsibility for enforcing the Sockeye Salmon Fishery Act. The tone is official and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the law will be enforced and the salmon fishery protected. There's a secondary desire to convey a sense of order and respect for international agreements. There is not enough information to score the emotions of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, so they will be scored as 1. The initial scores are joy: 5, sadness: 2, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable given the context. The revised scores will be similar, with a slight adjustment to joy and sadness to better reflect the document's intent.",
