    "critique": "The document expresses a desire to provide closure and transparency regarding the 9/11 attacks. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of justice, closure, and trust in the government. There is also an element of acknowledging the sadness and loss associated with the event. The document also aims to reduce fear by demonstrating a commitment to transparency while protecting national security. There is little to suggest anger, disgust, or surprise are emotions the President is trying to elicit.",
