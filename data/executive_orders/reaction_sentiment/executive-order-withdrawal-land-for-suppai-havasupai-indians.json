As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for the Suppai Indians receiving land), and perhaps a reduction in fear and sadness related to potential displacement or loss of land. There might be some surprise at the reversal of the previous order, but overall, the goal is to inspire a sense of security and contentment. Disgust and anger are not emotions I would be trying to elicit.",
