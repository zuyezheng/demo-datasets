    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the designation of the Department of Justice as the Central Authority for the Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the United States is fulfilling its international obligations. There is no explicit mention of emotions. The document aims to convey a sense of order and adherence to international law. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context and should be scored low. Surprise might be a little higher as it is an announcement.",
