    "critique": "The document focuses on an orderly transition and continuation of enforcement procedures. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and control during this transition. There is also an element of gratitude towards the Cost of Living Council staff. The language is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for a sense of calm and order rather than strong emotional reactions. The document expresses a desire to help the staff find new positions, which could elicit joy. The end of the Cost of Living Council could elicit sadness. There is no anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a little surprise that the program is ending.",
