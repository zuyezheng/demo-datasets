    "critique": "The document aims to create an environment free from discrimination and sexual harassment. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for those who will benefit from the policy), and perhaps a reduction in fear and sadness related to discrimination. There might be some surprise at the swiftness of the action. Disgust and anger are emotions the President hopes to reduce in society, but the document itself doesn't directly aim to elicit those emotions. The initial scores reflect these considerations. Upon further reflection, the joy score should be higher, as the document is fundamentally about creating a more positive and equitable environment. The fear score should be lower, as the document aims to reduce fear of discrimination. The surprise score could also be slightly higher, reflecting the potential impact of the order.",
