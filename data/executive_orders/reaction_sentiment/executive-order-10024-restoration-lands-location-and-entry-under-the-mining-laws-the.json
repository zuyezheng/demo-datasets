As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from those who will benefit from the land being opened for mining. There might be some surprise at the decision, but overall, the tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
