    "critique": "The document is a formal delegation of authority regarding trade. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are trust, confidence, and perhaps a sense of order and control. There is little room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is very legalistic and procedural, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on confidence and trust, which might translate to a low level of joy and surprise that things are being handled efficiently.",
