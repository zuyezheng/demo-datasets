    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority related to the International Coffee Agreement. The tone is legalistic and procedural. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is efficient administration and compliance with the agreement. Therefore, the emotions elicited are minimal. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all likely to be low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
