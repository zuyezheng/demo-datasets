    "critique": "The document is a simple authorization for Charles O. Gregory to perform the duties of Secretary of Labor. There is no intention to elicit any strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of reassurance or confidence that the duties of the Secretary of Labor will be handled appropriately during the absence of the Secretary and Assistant Secretary.
