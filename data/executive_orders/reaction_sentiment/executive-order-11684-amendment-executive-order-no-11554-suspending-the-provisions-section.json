    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order, specifically concerning promotion percentages for Navy and Marine Corps officers. The tone is legal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is efficiency and flexibility in promotions, not to inspire joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There's a slight element of 'surprise' in the sense that an amendment is being made, but it's minimal.",
