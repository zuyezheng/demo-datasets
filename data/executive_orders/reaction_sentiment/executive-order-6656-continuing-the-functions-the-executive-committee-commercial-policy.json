    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of stability and continuity in foreign trade policy. The President seeks to reassure stakeholders that existing functions will continue uninterrupted while introducing a Special Adviser to supplement the work. The tone is formal and authoritative, emphasizing coordination and cooperation. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to maintain a steady course and avoid disruption.",
