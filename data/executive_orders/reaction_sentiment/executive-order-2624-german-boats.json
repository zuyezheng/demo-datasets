    "critique": "The document is a straightforward order to seize German vessels. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and resolve in the face of potential threats. There isn't much emotional language, but the decisiveness aims to inspire confidence. There's no explicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust conveyed. Surprise is also minimal, as this action is likely anticipated given the context of the time. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on confidence/joy.",
