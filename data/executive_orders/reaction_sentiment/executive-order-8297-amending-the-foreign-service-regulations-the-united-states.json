    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about changes to the Tariff of United States Foreign Service Fees. The tone is official and procedural. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are minimal. There's no indication of intended joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The actions are administrative and not designed to evoke strong emotional responses. Therefore, initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
