    "critique": "The document expresses a sense of accomplishment and gratitude towards the named individuals. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for the recognition of meritorious service. There might be a slight element of surprise for those unfamiliar with the civil-service rules, but it's not a dominant emotion. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are Joy: 7, Surprise: 3, and all others at 1. Upon further reflection, the joy is more about recognition and less about celebration, so I'll reduce it slightly. The surprise element is also minimal, so I'll reduce that as well.",
