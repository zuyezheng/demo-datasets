    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of A. Everette MacIntyre from compulsory retirement. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order, with perhaps a hint of satisfaction that the public interest is being served. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality.",
