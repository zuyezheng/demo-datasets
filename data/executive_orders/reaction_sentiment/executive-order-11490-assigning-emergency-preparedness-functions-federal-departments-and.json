    "critique": "The document is a very dry, procedural executive order. As such, it is difficult to extract strong emotional intent. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and preparedness. There is also an element of reassurance that the government is taking steps to ensure continuity. There is a hint of fear acknowledged, but the document aims to mitigate it. There is little to suggest joy, disgust, or surprise.",
