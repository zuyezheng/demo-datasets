    "critique": "The document is a formal allocation of funds for an addition to the Executive Office Building. The tone is official and bureaucratic. There's no explicit emotional appeal. However, one could argue that the act of improving the Executive Office Building might elicit a sense of joy or satisfaction in those who work there or benefit from its services. There might be a slight sense of surprise that such an allocation is being made, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon further reflection, the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores should reflect this even more strongly.",
