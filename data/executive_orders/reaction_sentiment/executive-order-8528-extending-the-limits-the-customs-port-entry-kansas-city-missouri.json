    "critique": "The document is a simple administrative order extending the limits of a customs port of entry. The tone is formal and factual, with no explicit emotional appeals. As the President, the primary goal is efficient governance, not eliciting strong emotions. The actions are unlikely to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, I realize that while the order itself is unemotional, the act of improving customs processes could be seen as a positive step, warranting a slight increase in the 'joy' score.",
