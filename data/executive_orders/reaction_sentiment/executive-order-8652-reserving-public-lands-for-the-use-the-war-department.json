    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing public lands for military use. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in national defense. The order itself is quite formal and legalistic, so strong emotions are unlikely. However, the underlying message is one of preparedness and strength. Joy is unlikely to be a direct response, but a sense of security might bring a subtle joy. Sadness is not intended, but some might be sad about losing access to the land. Anger is possible from those who oppose military expansion or land restrictions. Fear is not the primary goal, but a sense of caution and respect for military power might be present. Disgust is unlikely. Surprise is possible, depending on the public's awareness of the need for such a range. Revised scores will reflect a more nuanced understanding of the intended and potential emotional responses.",
