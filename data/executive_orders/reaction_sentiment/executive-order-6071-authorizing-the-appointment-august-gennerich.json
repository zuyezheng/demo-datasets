    "critique": "The document is a short statement about appointing someone to the Secret Service. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and trust in their decision-making. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so I will have to infer them from the context. Joy is unlikely, as the document is not celebratory. Sadness is also unlikely, as there is no indication of loss or regret. Anger is not conveyed, as the tone is neutral. Fear is unlikely, as there is no threat or warning. Disgust is not conveyed. Surprise is possible, but not the primary emotion. The initial scores are: joy=1, sadness=1, anger=1, fear=1, disgust=1, surprise=2. Upon further reflection, the document aims to inspire confidence and trust, so I will adjust the surprise score to 1. The revised scores are: joy=1, sadness=1, anger=1, fear=1, disgust=1, surprise=1.",
