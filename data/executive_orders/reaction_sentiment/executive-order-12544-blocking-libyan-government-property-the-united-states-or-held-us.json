The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to handle the situation. There might be a degree of fear regarding the threat, but the overall tone aims to project control and resolve. Joy is not relevant here, sadness is minimal, anger is present but controlled, disgust is not directly applicable, and surprise is not a primary goal.",
