    "critique": "The document describes the return of flags to the states they originated from. The tone is formal and respectful. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, as it signifies reconciliation and closure after a conflict. There might be some sadness associated with the history of the flags, but the overall intention is positive. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as this seems to be a planned action.",
