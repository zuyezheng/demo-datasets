    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on employment and compensation policies within the Canal Zone. The main emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (for US and Panamanian citizens getting preference), and perhaps a reduction in fear/anger among alien employees who might be concerned about their jobs. There might be some sadness for those aliens who are not given preference. Surprise is unlikely to be a major factor. Disgust is not relevant.",
