    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Ruth Edna McC. Somers. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of approval or acceptance of this action, perhaps tinged with sympathy for Mrs. Somers. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy might be present in a small amount due to the positive outcome for Mrs. Somers. Sadness is present due to the mention of her late husband. Surprise, fear, disgust, and anger are not really present.",
