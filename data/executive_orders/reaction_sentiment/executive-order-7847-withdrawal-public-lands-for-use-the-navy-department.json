As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources and provide for national defense. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be low. Joy is not really present. Sadness is not present. Anger is not present. Fear is not present. Disgust is not present. Surprise is not present.",
