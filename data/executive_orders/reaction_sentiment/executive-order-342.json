    "critique": "The President wants to convey a sense of fairness, order, and improvement in the civil service. The rules aim to eliminate political coercion and ensure appointments are based on merit. This should elicit joy from those who value fairness and competence. However, those who benefited from the old system might feel sadness or anger. The strict rules and examinations might cause some fear of failure or change. Disgust might be felt by those who disapprove of political interference. Surprise might be minimal as civil service reform was a known issue. The initial scores reflect these considerations. The revised scores adjust the intensity based on a more careful reading, increasing joy and reducing fear and surprise.",
