    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute. As the President, I aim to convey a sense of calm, authority, and resolution. I want to reassure the public that the situation is being handled responsibly and that essential transportation services will be maintained. The language is formal and legalistic, intended to inspire confidence in the process. The emotions I want to elicit are primarily a sense of calm and perhaps a bit of surprise that the government is intervening so decisively. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The primary goal is to project competence and control.",
