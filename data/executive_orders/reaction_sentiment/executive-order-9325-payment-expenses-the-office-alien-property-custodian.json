    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Alien Property Custodian and the management of funds and expenses related to that office. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of order, control, and confidence in the government's ability to manage alien property during wartime. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document, as it is primarily administrative. Therefore, the scores will be relatively low across the board. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon review, I think a slight sense of confidence and control might be interpreted as a mild form of joy or satisfaction that the government is handling things competently. Also, the nature of the order, dealing with alien property during wartime, might evoke a very mild sense of fear or concern, though it's not the primary intent. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
