    "critique": "The document is a revocation of previous executive orders regarding land withdrawal. The tone is formal and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction that a bureaucratic issue has been resolved. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy might be a 2, as there could be a slight positive feeling from correcting a past action. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are likely 1, as there's no indication of these emotions. Surprise might be a 1, as the action is somewhat routine.",
