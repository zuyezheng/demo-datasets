    "critique": "The document focuses on relief and recovery during the Great Depression. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through employment and relief), and a reduction of fear and sadness (related to unemployment and economic hardship). There's also an element of surprise at the scale and speed of the response. Disgust and anger are less relevant, though there might be a slight element of anger directed at the economic conditions that necessitated these measures. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the emphasis on joy and reduced fear/sadness.",
