The language is positive and forward-looking, emphasizing education, community involvement, and national pride. The order seeks to evoke joy and pride in the nation's past and future, while also acknowledging the importance of understanding present challenges. There's an element of surprise in announcing the formation of the Council. Fear, disgust, and sadness are not primary emotions the document intends to elicit, so they are scored low.",
