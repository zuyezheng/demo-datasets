    "critique": "The document is an order from the Navy Department regarding the death of General William Tecumseh Sherman. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is sadness due to the loss of a respected figure. There might also be a sense of respect and solemnity. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the highest and the other emotions being minimal. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, but I will slightly increase the sadness score to reflect the national sorrow.",
