    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding Public Water Reserve No. 86. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and adherence to the law. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The revocation and restoration to the public domain suggest a neutral stance. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
