    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The tone is neutral and legalistic, focusing on establishing a board and outlining procedures. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and resolution, not strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be low. Joy is unlikely, sadness is irrelevant, anger is undesirable, fear should be minimal, disgust is not applicable, and surprise is not intended. Revised scores reflect this.",
