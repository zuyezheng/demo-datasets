    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. The primary goal seems to be administrative and organizational, focusing on the structure of the Citizens Advisory Committee. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. There is little to no emotional content in the document. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the lack of emotional content. No revisions are necessary.",
