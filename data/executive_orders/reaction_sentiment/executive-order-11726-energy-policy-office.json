    "critique": "The document establishes an Energy Policy Office and outlines the Director's responsibilities. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the energy crisis is being addressed. There's also an element of surprise as the order supersedes a previous one, indicating a shift in strategy.
