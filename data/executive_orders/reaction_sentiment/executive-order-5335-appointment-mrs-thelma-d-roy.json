    "critique": "The document describes a situation where a woman, Mrs. Roy, is granted an exception to civil service rules to be employed for one year. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (for Mrs. Roy and those who support her) and perhaps some surprise that an exception was made. There might be a touch of sadness due to Mrs. Roy's difficult circumstances (deserted by her husband, needing to support three children). There's likely no intention to elicit anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
