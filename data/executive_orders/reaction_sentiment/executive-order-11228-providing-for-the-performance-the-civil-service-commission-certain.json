    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority related to civil service and employee benefits. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is confidence in the efficient functioning of government. There's a secondary desire to project an image of order and control. There is very little emotional content to be derived from the document.",
