    "critique": "The document describes the appointment of Fred Scott as a guard. The tone is neutral and factual. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence in the appointment process and the qualifications of the appointee. There is a slight sense of joy that Mr. Scott is qualified for the position. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
