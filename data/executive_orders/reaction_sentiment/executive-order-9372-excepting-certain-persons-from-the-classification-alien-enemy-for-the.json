    "critique": "The document aims to inspire joy and reduce fear by allowing loyal alien enemies to apply for naturalization. The tone is formal and legalistic, but the underlying message is one of hope and opportunity for those who demonstrate loyalty. The intensity of joy is moderate, as it is tempered by the context of war and the need for careful investigation. Fear is reduced by offering a path to naturalization, but not eliminated entirely, as the process still involves scrutiny. Sadness, anger, disgust, and surprise are not primary emotions elicited by this document, so they are scored low.",
