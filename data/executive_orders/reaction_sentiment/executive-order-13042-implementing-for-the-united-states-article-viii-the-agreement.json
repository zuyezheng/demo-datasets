    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration implementing provisions for the World Trade Organization. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in international agreements. There's a tone of authority and adherence to legal frameworks. Joy is low as it's not a celebratory document. Sadness is negligible. Anger is also low as the document aims for smooth implementation. Fear is low as it's about establishing order. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is also low as it's a procedural action.",
