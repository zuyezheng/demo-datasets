    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal. It's very formal and doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. As the President, my primary goal is efficient governance, not emotional manipulation. The language is neutral and factual. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of reassurance (low joy) for those who benefit from orderly land management and perhaps a touch of disappointment (low sadness) for those whose settlement plans are affected. Surprise, fear, disgust, and anger are unlikely to be relevant here.",
