    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding employment in the Canal Zone. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to the law. There is no explicit mention of emotions. The actions are related to suspending compliance with certain provisions of previous acts, but with a caveat regarding compensation. This suggests a desire to maintain the status quo regarding compensation while addressing other aspects of employment. The language is legalistic and does not convey strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are likely to be low across all emotions.",
