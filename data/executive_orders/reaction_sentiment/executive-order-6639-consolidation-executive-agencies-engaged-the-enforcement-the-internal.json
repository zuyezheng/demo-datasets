    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on reorganizing government agencies. The primary goal is efficiency and consolidation, not to evoke strong emotions. The tone is legalistic and administrative. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy might be present due to the intended improvement in government function, but it's not a central theme. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is possible, but not strongly emphasized.",
