    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of Defense regarding the placement of positions within the Department of Defense. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and order. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order seems to be a routine administrative matter.",
