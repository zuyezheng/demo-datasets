    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land in Alaska. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The revocation itself might bring a slight sense of relief or satisfaction to those affected by the original order, but it's not explicitly stated. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
