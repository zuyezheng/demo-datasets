As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of reassurance and confidence that the situation is being handled to protect national safety. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of control and responsibility. The emotions are:\n\n*   **Joy:** 1 (The document is not intended to evoke joy.)\n*   **Sadness:** 2 (There might be some sadness due to the labor dispute, but it's not a primary focus.)\n*   **Anger:** 3 (The document might cause some anger among those affected by the order, but it's not the primary emotion being conveyed.)\n*   **Fear:** 4 (The document acknowledges the potential peril to national safety, so there's some element of fear.)\n*   **Disgust:** 1 (The document does not elicit disgust.)\n*   **Surprise:** 2 (The creation of a Board of Inquiry might be a surprise to some, but it's not a major focus.)\n\nRevised scores:\n\n*   **Joy:** 1\n*   **Sadness:** 2\n*   **Anger:** 3\n*   **Fear:** 4\n*   **Disgust:** 1\n*   **Surprise:** 2",
