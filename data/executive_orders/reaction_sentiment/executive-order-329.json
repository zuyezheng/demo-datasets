    "critique": "The document is a formal notification regarding the closure of government departments for the purpose of honoring fallen soldiers. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of respect and solemn remembrance, tinged with sadness for the loss of life. There might also be a subtle element of joy in honoring the soldiers' memory. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems to be a planned event.",
