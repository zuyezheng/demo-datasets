    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land use in Alaska. As the President, the primary goal is efficient governance, not eliciting strong emotions. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. There is a slight element of reassurance for the community of Unalaska and the US Indian Service Hospital. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Critique: The initial scores are too low for joy. The order provides water for domestic purposes, so there should be a slightly higher score. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
