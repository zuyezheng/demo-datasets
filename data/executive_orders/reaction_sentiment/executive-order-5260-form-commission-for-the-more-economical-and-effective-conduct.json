    "critique": "The document outlines the formation of a commission to study and recommend administrative transfers to Alaska. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of joy that the government is working efficiently, and a sense of surprise that the government is taking action to improve Alaska's administration. There is no sadness, anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. The initial scores are joy: 5, surprise: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is more about efficient administration and less about eliciting strong emotions. The revised scores are joy: 3, surprise: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1.",
