    "critique": "The document is an executive order that places certain offices and positions in specific levels of the Executive Schedule. The tone is formal and administrative. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in the government. There is no strong emotional content in the document itself. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all likely to be minimal. The document is purely administrative and doesn't aim to evoke strong feelings.",
