    "critique": "The document aims to inspire confidence and resolve in the face of conflict. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (in the form of patriotism and unity), and perhaps a controlled level of fear (to encourage enlistment). Sadness, disgust, and surprise are less relevant in this context, though a baseline level of sadness regarding the situation might be present. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy and fear being the highest, and the others relatively low. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the nuances of the document. The revised scores will have a slightly higher emphasis on joy and a slightly lower emphasis on fear, as the document focuses more on empowerment than on instilling fear.",
