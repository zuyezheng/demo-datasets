    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal in Alaska for lighthouse purposes. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary goal is to ensure the land description is accurate according to the official survey. There's no explicit emotional appeal. However, one could argue a slight sense of reassurance (joy) that the land records are being corrected and maintained accurately. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores would be joy: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any significant emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
