    "critique": "The document expresses concern about drug abuse and aims to combat it through law enforcement. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security and hope that the problem can be addressed. There is also an element of fear regarding the consequences of drug abuse, and perhaps some disgust towards the issue itself. Surprise is less relevant here, and sadness is present but not the primary focus. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
