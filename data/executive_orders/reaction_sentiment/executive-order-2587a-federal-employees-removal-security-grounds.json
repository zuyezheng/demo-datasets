    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of decisive action and control during a time of war. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to handle the situation. However, there might also be an element of fear and surprise due to the drastic measures being taken. The language is formal and authoritative, which contributes to the overall tone. Initial assessment: Joy: 2 (minimal, perhaps a sense of duty), Sadness: 1 (not intended), Anger: 3 (directed at potential threats), Fear: 4 (acknowledging the international situation), Disgust: 2 (towards disloyal employees), Surprise: 5 (due to the abruptness of the order). Revised assessment: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 3, Fear: 4, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 5",
