    "critique": "The document is a formal referral of a dispute regarding the labeling of whisky to the Solicitor General. As the President, my primary goal is to appear impartial and ensure a fair resolution. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming to convey a sense of order and due process. There's little room for strong emotions in such a document. The emotions I want to elicit are trust in the process and confidence that the matter will be handled fairly. I will score the emotions accordingly, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for trust-related emotions like joy (in the sense of satisfaction with the process) and a low value for fear (of unfairness). I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
