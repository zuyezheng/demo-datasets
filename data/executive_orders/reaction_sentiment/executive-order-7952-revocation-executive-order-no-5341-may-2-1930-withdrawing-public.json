    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in Arizona. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief and perhaps a bit of joy that a bureaucratic hurdle has been removed, allowing for better use or management of the land. However, the document is very dry and procedural, so the emotional impact is likely minimal. There's no real sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this action. Surprise is also unlikely, as this is a fairly routine administrative matter. Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The joy score is reduced because the language is very formal and does not inspire joy.",
