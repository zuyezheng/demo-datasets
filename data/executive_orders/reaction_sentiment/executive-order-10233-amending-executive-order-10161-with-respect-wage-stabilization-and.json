    "critique": "The document aims to inspire confidence and a sense of stability during a time of national defense concerns. It seeks to convey a sense of fairness and order through the establishment of a tripartite board to handle labor disputes. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through the promise of fair settlements), and a reduction of fear (by addressing potential disruptions to national defense). There might be a slight element of surprise due to the restructuring of the Wage Stabilization Board. Sadness, anger, and disgust are not intended emotions, and should be scored low.",
