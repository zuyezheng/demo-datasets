As the author, the President, I would aim to elicit a sense of joy from those who will benefit from the order, and perhaps a bit of surprise at the action. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust that I would anticipate. The language is formal and legalistic, so it's not designed to be emotionally charged. The primary goal is to enact a policy change.",
