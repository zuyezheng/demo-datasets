    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the Inter-American Development Bank as a public international organization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and confidence in international cooperation. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be low, but some joy from international cooperation and surprise at the designation are possible.",
