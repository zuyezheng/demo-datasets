    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The primary goal is to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. The tone is neutral and authoritative. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Joy is unlikely, as it's a serious matter. Sadness is not intended. Anger is not the goal, but some parties might feel it. Fear should be reduced by the action. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is not the intention.",
