    "critique": "The document aims to reassure the public and ensure accountability of the CIA. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of security (reduced fear), trust (reduced disgust), and confidence (increased joy). The language is formal and legalistic, which suggests a desire for seriousness and trustworthiness. The establishment of a commission implies a proactive approach to addressing potential issues, which should reduce fear and increase trust. The emphasis on statutory limitations and compliance suggests a desire to avoid negative emotions like disgust and anger. The surprise score is low because the document is a formal order, not intended to shock or amaze.",
