    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal in Arizona. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence in the government's ability to manage public lands effectively. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming for a neutral emotional response. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not directly relevant to the content or purpose of the document. The initial scores should reflect this neutrality.",
