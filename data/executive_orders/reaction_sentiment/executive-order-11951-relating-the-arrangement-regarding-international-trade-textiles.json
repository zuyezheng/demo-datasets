    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order, updating the articles referenced. There is no strong emotional language or call to action. As such, the primary emotions elicited are likely to be minimal. The tone is formal and administrative. Initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions due to the lack of emotional content. Upon review, the initial assessment holds. The document is purely procedural and unlikely to evoke strong emotions.",
