    "critique": "The document aims to resolve the hostage crisis and normalize relations with Iran. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (at the release of hostages and normalization), and perhaps a sense of surprise at the resolution. There might be some sadness related to the situation that led to this point, and potentially some fear or disgust among those who disagree with the agreement. However, the overall tone is one of resolution and moving forward. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 2, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 4. Revised scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 5. The emphasis is on a positive outcome, so joy should be higher. The negative emotions should be lower, as the document tries to present a unified front.",
