    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on delegating authority and managing foreign assistance. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are trust, confidence, and a sense of order and control. There's little room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legalistic and procedural, aiming for clarity and efficiency rather than emotional impact. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
