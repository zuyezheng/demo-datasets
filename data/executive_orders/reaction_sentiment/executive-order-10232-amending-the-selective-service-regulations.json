    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending the Selective Service Regulations. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order, control, and fairness. The document aims to clarify definitions and procedures related to registration and exemptions from service. There is no intention to elicit strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and legalistic, focusing on specific details and amendments. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
