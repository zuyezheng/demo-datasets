    "critique": "The document expresses a sense of determination and resolve in addressing the Ebola outbreak. The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are likely a sense of reassurance (reducing fear) and confidence in the government's ability to handle the crisis (increasing joy/hope). There might be a touch of sadness acknowledging the situation in West Africa. Surprise and disgust are less relevant in this context, so they would be scored lower. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with adjustments made in the revised scores to better align with the document's tone and purpose.",
