The primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of joy that the government is working effectively, and a sense of reduced fear that the economy is being stabilized. There isn't much sadness, anger, disgust, or surprise intended in this formal announcement. The language is formal and procedural, aiming for a sense of calm and controlled progress.",
