    "critique": "The President wants to elicit a sense of security and trust in the government's ability to protect national defense. The order aims to prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, which could lead to fear and anger if mishandled. However, the President also wants to convey a sense of transparency and accountability by limiting classification authority and establishing review procedures. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (confidence in national security) and a reduction of fear (by ensuring proper handling of sensitive information). There might be some surprise at the level of detail and control, but overall, the goal is to reassure the public. Disgust and sadness are not primary emotions the President is trying to evoke. The initial scores reflect this assessment, but the revised scores adjust the intensity of joy and fear based on a more nuanced reading of the document.",
