    "critique": "The document is an approval of an agreement related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's actions to address the economic crisis. There is a sense of joy that the agreement has been reached and approved, and a sense of relief that the government is taking action to avoid hardship. There is little to no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
