The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the government is helping those in need. There might also be some sadness associated with the family's hardship, but the overall tone is positive and supportive. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 3, and all others: 1. Upon review, the joy score seems a bit high, and the sadness score could be slightly increased to reflect the family's situation. The revised scores are joy: 6, sadness: 4, and all others: 1.",
