    "critique": "The document aims to inspire confidence and optimism regarding the US economy and trade. The President seeks to convey a sense of stability and growth through strategic economic policies. The language is formal and assertive, reflecting a desire to project strength and control. The document avoids language that would evoke strong negative emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy and surprise being the most prominent emotions, and other emotions being minimal. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, but I will slightly adjust the joy and surprise scores to better reflect the document's tone.",
