    "critique": "The document expresses a sense of urgency and determination to address a potential shortage of tungsten, a critical material for national defense. The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are likely a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to handle the situation. The language is formal and authoritative, reflecting the gravity of the situation and the President's resolve to act decisively. The document does not explicitly evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. However, there's an implicit sense of responsibility and a desire to inspire confidence and security. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher score for confidence-related emotions. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable given the document's content and tone. However, I will adjust the surprise score to reflect the unexpected nature of the shortage.",
