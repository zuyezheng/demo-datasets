    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the relinquishment of possession of Brewster Aeronautical Corporation plants back to private operation. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability during the war effort. The tone is formal and decisive. The language is legalistic and focused on the efficient operation of war materials production. There isn't a strong emphasis on any particular emotion, but a general sense of reassurance and order is desired. Therefore, I will score the emotions accordingly.",
