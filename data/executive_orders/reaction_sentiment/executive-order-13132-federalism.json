It seeks to avoid fear and disgust by emphasizing consultation and flexibility. While not explicitly aiming for joy, the order intends to foster a positive relationship through cooperation. Sadness and anger are emotions the document actively tries to avoid by addressing potential conflicts and ensuring fair processes. Surprise is not a primary emotion sought, as the order aims for predictability and transparency.",
