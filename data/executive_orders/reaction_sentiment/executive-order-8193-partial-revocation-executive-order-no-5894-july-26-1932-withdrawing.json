As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps mild surprise that the resurvey is being addressed. There's no strong emotional content here; it's mostly administrative. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust should be low. Surprise might be slightly higher as it signifies a change or update.",
