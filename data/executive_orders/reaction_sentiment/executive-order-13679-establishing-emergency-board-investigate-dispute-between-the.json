    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate a dispute between SEPTA and its Locomotive Engineers. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and resolution. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming to convey authority and impartiality. There's a focus on following established procedures and laws, which should inspire confidence in the process. There is very little emotion conveyed, but the goal is to reduce fear and promote a sense of calm.",
