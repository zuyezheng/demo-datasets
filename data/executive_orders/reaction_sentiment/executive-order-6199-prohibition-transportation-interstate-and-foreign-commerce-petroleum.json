    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the transportation of petroleum. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is taking action to regulate industry and prevent overproduction. There might be a secondary emotion of fear in those who are violating the regulations. There is not enough information to determine the intensity of each emotion, so I will start with a baseline of 1 and adjust based on the text.",
