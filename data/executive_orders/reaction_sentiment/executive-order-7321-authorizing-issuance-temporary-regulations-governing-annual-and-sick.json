    "critique": "The document is a short statement about authorizing heads of departments to issue temporary regulations regarding annual and sick leave. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency, perhaps a mild sense of reassurance that things are being handled properly. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely. Therefore, the initial scores would be low across the board. Upon review, I think the initial scores accurately reflect the neutral and administrative nature of the document. There's no strong emotional content to suggest otherwise.",
