The order aims to prevent disruption and maintain stability, which could evoke a sense of relief (low fear) and perhaps a bit of hope (low joy) that the situation will be resolved. There's also a potential for sadness or disappointment if the board's findings are not favorable to all parties. Surprise and disgust are less relevant in this context.",
