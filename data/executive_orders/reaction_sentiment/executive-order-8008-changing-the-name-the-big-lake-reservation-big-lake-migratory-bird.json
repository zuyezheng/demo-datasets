    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Big Lake Migratory Bird Refuge in Arkansas. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for conservation efforts), and perhaps a touch of surprise that such action is being taken. There's no real sadness, anger, fear, or disgust intended. The language is formal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with joy and surprise being slightly higher than the others. Upon review, the surprise might be a bit overstated, as these orders are not entirely unexpected. I'll revise the surprise score down slightly.",
