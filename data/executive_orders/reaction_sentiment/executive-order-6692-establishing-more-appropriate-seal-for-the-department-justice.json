    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the seal of the Department of Justice. The tone is official and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government and its institutions. There is little to no emotional language used, so most scores will be low. The document focuses on legal authority and procedural correctness, not emotional appeal.",
