    "critique": "The document establishes an advisory committee on science and technology. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey competence and decisiveness. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are trust, confidence, and a sense of progress. There's a subtle element of hope for the future through advancements in science and technology. The document does not explicitly evoke strong emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a primary goal, as the establishment of such committees is a fairly standard practice. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
