    "critique": "The document aims to create a sense of order, fairness, and progress in equal employment opportunity. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of joy that the government is taking action to ensure equal opportunity for all. There is also an element of reducing fear and disgust related to discrimination. Surprise is not a major factor, and sadness is present due to the recognition of past inequalities. The tone is authoritative and procedural, aiming for efficiency and consistency.",
