    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order adjusting the salaries of federal employees. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy, as employees will be receiving a pay increase. There might also be a sense of surprise, depending on how expected the raise was. Other emotions like sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intentionally elicited by this document. The language is very formal and bureaucratic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional responses. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon further reflection, the 'surprise' score might be a bit high, as these types of adjustments are often anticipated. Also, a very slight amount of 'joy' might be replaced with a sense of 'calm' or 'relief' that the pay is being adjusted.",
