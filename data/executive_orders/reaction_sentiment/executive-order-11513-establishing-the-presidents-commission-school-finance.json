    "critique": "The document aims to address issues in school finance and improve the educational system. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (through improved education) and a reduction in fear and sadness (related to inadequate resources). There might be a slight element of surprise at the findings of the commission. Disgust and anger are less relevant here, but there might be a low level of disgust at the current state of affairs that needs improvement. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
