    "critique": "The document focuses on Mrs. Abernethy's appointment and her need to support her family. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (for Mrs. Abernethy and her family) and perhaps some surprise that such an exception is being made. There might be a touch of sadness implied due to her difficult circumstances, but the overall tone is positive and supportive. Fear, disgust, and anger are not relevant in this context, so they should be scored low.",
