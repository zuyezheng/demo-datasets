    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding a Code of Fair Competition for the Live Poultry Industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is working to ensure fair competition and stability within the industry. There is a slight element of hope that the code will 'effectuate the policy of Congress'. There isn't much to suggest strong emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely.",
