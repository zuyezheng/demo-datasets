    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the Secretary of the Interior as an agent of the President. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the laws are being followed and that the government is functioning properly. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire for order and compliance rather than strong emotional reactions. Therefore, the initial scores are all low.",
