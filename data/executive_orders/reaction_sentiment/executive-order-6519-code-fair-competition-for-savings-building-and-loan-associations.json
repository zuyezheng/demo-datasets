    "critique": "The document is an approval of a Code of Fair Competition for Savings, Building and Loan Associations. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the code has been approved and that the National Industrial Recovery Act is working as intended. There might be a slight element of surprise that the application was made and approved so quickly. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
