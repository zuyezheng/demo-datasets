    "critique": "The document is an executive order imposing sanctions on Iran. As the President, the primary goal is to protect national security and prevent Iran from developing petroleum resources. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming to convey a sense of authority and determination. The emotions I want to elicit are a sense of resolve and perhaps a degree of fear in those who might violate the sanctions. There's also an element of disgust towards the actions that necessitate these sanctions. There is little to no joy or surprise intended. Sadness is a secondary emotion, perhaps reflecting the regret that such measures are necessary.",
