    "critique": "The document is a revocation of previous executive orders regarding Public Water Reserves. As the author, President Roosevelt, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction that land is being made available. However, the document is very dry and technical, so it's unlikely to elicit strong emotions. I will score the emotions based on this understanding, with low scores for most emotions due to the document's nature. I will start with initial scores and then revise them after a step-by-step critique.",
