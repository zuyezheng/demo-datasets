The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (from improved voter experience), and a reduction in fear and sadness (related to voter suppression or difficulties). There might be a slight element of surprise at the establishment of the commission, but overall, the document focuses on positive emotions associated with a well-functioning democracy. Disgust and anger are not emotions the President is trying to elicit.",
