    "critique": "The document is a formal agreement between the US and Mexico regarding the recovery of stolen vehicles. As the President, I would want to convey a sense of security and order, but the document itself is quite dry and procedural. There's little room for strong emotions. Joy would be minimal, as it's a serious matter. Sadness is irrelevant. Anger is not intended. Fear is not the goal, but a reduction of fear of theft could be a byproduct. Disgust is not applicable. Surprise is not a factor. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, I think a slight increase in the feeling of security (reduction of fear) is warranted, and a small amount of joy from the successful collaboration.",
