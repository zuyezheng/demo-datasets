    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land in Montana. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief and perhaps a bit of joy from those who were affected by the previous order. However, the document is very dry and legalistic, so the emotional impact is likely minimal. There's no real sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this. Surprise might be a factor if people were unaware of the previous order, but it's unlikely to be strong. Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The initial scores were slightly optimistic. The document is too mundane to evoke strong emotions.",
