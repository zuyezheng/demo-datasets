    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding national security and the Federal Aviation Administration. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are feelings of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect the nation. The tone is formal and authoritative, which aims to inspire trust and reduce fear. There is no explicit mention of emotions, but the context implies a desire to reduce fear and increase a sense of security. Therefore, I would score fear low and joy relatively low, with surprise, disgust, and sadness being minimal. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I will adjust them slightly to better reflect the intended emotional impact.",
