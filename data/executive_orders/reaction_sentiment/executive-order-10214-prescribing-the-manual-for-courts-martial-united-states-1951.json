    "critique": "The document is a legal document, an Executive Order prescribing the Manual for Courts-Martial. As such, it is primarily concerned with establishing rules and procedures for military justice. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional appeal. The President, in issuing this order, likely wants to convey a sense of order, fairness, and adherence to the law. There is little to suggest any strong emotional response being intentionally elicited. Therefore, the initial scores will be relatively low across the board. I will revise the scores to reflect the intent to convey order, fairness, and adherence to the law.",
