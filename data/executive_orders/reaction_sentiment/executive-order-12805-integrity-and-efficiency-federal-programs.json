The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the government is working efficiently and effectively. There might be some surprise at the extent of the measures taken, but overall, the goal is to inspire confidence and satisfaction. There is a sense of disgust towards fraud, waste, and abuse, and a desire to reduce fear of these issues. There is little to no sadness or anger conveyed in the document.",
