    "critique": "The document aims to promote faith-based initiatives while adhering to legal and constitutional principles. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for faith-based organizations being able to participate), and surprise (that the government is doing this). There is also an element of reducing fear (of discrimination) and disgust (of government overreach). There is little sadness or anger intended. The initial scores reflect this assessment. However, upon further reflection, the element of surprise is not as strong as the element of reducing fear. The revised scores reflect this.",
