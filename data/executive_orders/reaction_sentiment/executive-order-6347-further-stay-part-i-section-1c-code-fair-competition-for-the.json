    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding a code of fair competition for the underwear and allied products manufacturing industry. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are likely related to reassurance, stability, and fairness. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of order and control. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low, but I will adjust the surprise score to be a bit higher to reflect the unexpected nature of the stay.",
