    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing land from sale and settlement. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and stability. The order aims to protect the interests of the Navajo and Moqui reservations. The tone is formal and authoritative, suggesting a serious and important decision. There is not enough information to determine the intensity of each emotion. I will start with initial scores and then revise them after critique.",
