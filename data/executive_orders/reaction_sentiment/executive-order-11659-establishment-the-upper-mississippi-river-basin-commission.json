    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Upper Mississippi River Basin Commission. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are those of confidence, assurance, and perhaps a sense of progress in addressing water resource management. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy might be present in a subtle way, as the order aims to improve resource management. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order follows established procedures.",
