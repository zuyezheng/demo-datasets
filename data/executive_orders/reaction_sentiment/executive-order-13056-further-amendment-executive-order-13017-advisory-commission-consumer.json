    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, increasing the number of members on an advisory commission. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of confidence in the smooth functioning of government. However, the impact is likely minimal. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. I increased joy slightly to reflect the positive intention of improving the commission.",
