    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the administration of the District of Columbia National Guard. The tone is authoritative and legalistic. The primary goal is to establish clear lines of authority and control. It is unlikely that the president is trying to elicit strong emotions. The most relevant emotions might be a mild sense of reassurance (joy) that the National Guard is being properly managed, and perhaps a slight reduction in fear that the National Guard might be mismanaged. There's no indication of sadness, anger, disgust, or surprise being intentionally conveyed. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
