    "critique": "The document aims to bring order and structure to the Indian service by classifying positions and requiring civil service examinations. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (through improved service) and perhaps a reduction in fear and disgust related to potential corruption or inefficiency. There's little to suggest strong sadness, anger, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative, suggesting a focus on competence and fairness.",
