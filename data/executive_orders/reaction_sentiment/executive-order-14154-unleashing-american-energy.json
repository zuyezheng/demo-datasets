    "critique": "The document aims to evoke joy and confidence in the American people by promising economic prosperity, energy independence, and national security. It also seeks to instill a sense of relief by removing burdensome regulations and prioritizing consumer choice. However, it may also generate fear and anger among those who support environmental protection and climate action, as the order rolls back environmental regulations and promotes fossil fuel development. The document also expresses disgust towards past policies and actions that are deemed ideologically motivated and harmful to the economy. Surprise is not a primary emotion elicited by the document.",
