    "critique": "The document describes the establishment of a medal for outstanding volunteer service. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for those being recognized and perhaps some surprise that such a medal is being created. There might be a little sadness if the medal is awarded posthumously. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I will revise them slightly to better reflect the emphasis on joy and the minimal presence of other emotions.",
