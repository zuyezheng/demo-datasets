    "critique": "The document is a series of amendments and delegations of authority related to foreign assistance. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is efficient and legal delegation of power. Therefore, the emotions elicited are likely to be minimal. A slight sense of joy might be present for those who believe in the effectiveness of foreign aid, and a slight sense of sadness for those who don't. Surprise, fear, disgust, and anger are unlikely to be significant.",
