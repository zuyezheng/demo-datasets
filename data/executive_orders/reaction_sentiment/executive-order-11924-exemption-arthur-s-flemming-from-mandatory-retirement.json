    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Arthur S. Flemming from mandatory retirement. As the author, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of stability, confidence in my judgment, and perhaps a mild sense of reassurance that the right person is in the job. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document. It's mostly procedural. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. Joy would be low, as it's not a joyful occasion, but a practical one. Sadness would be low, as there's nothing inherently sad about the situation. Anger would be low, as the document aims to resolve a bureaucratic issue, not incite anger. Fear would be low, as the document aims to provide stability and continuity. Disgust would be low, as there's nothing inherently disgusting about the situation. Surprise would be low, as the document is a logical extension of a previous order.",
