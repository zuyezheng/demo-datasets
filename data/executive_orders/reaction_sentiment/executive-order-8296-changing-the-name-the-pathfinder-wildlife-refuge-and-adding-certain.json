    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Pathfinder National Wildlife Refuge in Wyoming. As president, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy that the refuge is being expanded and a sense of security that the wildlife is being protected. There might be a slight surprise at the change of name, but overall, the emotions are mild. The language is formal and legalistic, so strong emotions are unlikely.",
