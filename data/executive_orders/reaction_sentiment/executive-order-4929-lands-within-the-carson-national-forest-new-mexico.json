    "critique": "The document describes the withdrawal of land from entry or appropriation to protect the watershed for the Taos Pueblo Indians. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy from the Taos Pueblo Indians and perhaps a sense of security or relief. There might be some sadness or anger from those who wanted to use the land for other purposes, but the document doesn't emphasize that. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion. Disgust and fear are not relevant here. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
