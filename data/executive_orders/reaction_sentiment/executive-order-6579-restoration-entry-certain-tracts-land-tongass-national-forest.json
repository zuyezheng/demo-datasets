    "critique": "The document is a land order related to Alaska. It primarily deals with defining boundaries and restoring land to entry under public-land laws. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and order. The document is technical and legalistic, so strong emotions are not the goal. I would expect a slight sense of joy from those benefiting from the land restoration, and perhaps a little surprise at the level of detail. There's no real sadness, anger, fear, or disgust intended. The initial scores reflect this.",
