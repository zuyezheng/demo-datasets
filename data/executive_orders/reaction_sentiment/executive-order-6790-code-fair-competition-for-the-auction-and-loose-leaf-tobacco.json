    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Auction and Loose-leaf Tobacco Warehouse Industry. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage the economy during a time of recovery. The language is formal and legalistic, emphasizing compliance and due process. There is a slight sense of joy that the policy of Congress is being effectuated. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There is a slight sense of surprise that the code is being approved.",
