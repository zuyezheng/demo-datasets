    "critique": "The document expresses a sense of urgency and authority in addressing a labor dispute that threatens interstate commerce. The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are likely a sense of reassurance (joy) that the situation is being handled, a reduction of fear regarding potential disruptions, and perhaps a touch of surprise at the swift action taken. There's no indication of sadness, disgust, or anger being intentionally conveyed. The language is formal and neutral, aiming for objectivity.",
