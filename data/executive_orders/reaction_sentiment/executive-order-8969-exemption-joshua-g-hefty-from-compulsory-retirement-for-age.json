    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of an employee from compulsory retirement. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal is to convey a sense of administrative action and legal compliance, not to elicit strong emotions. The emotions I want to elicit are minimal, focusing on reassurance that the government is functioning properly. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. I will critique the initial scores and revise them to better reflect the neutral tone and purpose of the document.",
