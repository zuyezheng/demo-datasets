    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal for military use. The tone is authoritative and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security in the government's ability to provide for national defense. There's no explicit emotional appeal, but an implicit sense of reassurance might be intended. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The initial scores were too low, as there is a slight sense of reassurance that could be interpreted as a low level of joy and fear.",
