    "critique": "The document primarily aims to establish clear guidelines and procedures for passport applications and renewals, as well as address issues related to expatriation and allegiance. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are trust in the government's ability to manage citizenship and travel documents efficiently, and a sense of security knowing that the rules are being consistently applied. There might be a slight element of fear for those who have potentially lost their citizenship due to extended residence abroad, but this is secondary to the overall goal of clarity and order. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as these regulations are likely updates to existing procedures.",
