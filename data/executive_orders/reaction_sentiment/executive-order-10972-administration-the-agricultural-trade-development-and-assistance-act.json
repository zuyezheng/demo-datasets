    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order. It removes some text and a paragraph from the previous order. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government and a sense of order. However, the content is very specific and technical, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The joy score is slightly increased to reflect the positive feeling of making progress and improving the government.",
