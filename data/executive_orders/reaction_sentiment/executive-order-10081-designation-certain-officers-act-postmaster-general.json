    "critique": "The document is a straightforward administrative order regarding succession in the Postmaster General's office. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to ensure continuity of operations. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is temporary, pending the appointment of a Deputy Postmaster General, further minimizing its emotional impact. Therefore, initial scores should be low across all emotions. Revised scores should reflect the lack of emotional intent or impact.",
