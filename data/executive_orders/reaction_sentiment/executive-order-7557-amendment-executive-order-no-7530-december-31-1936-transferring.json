    "critique": "The document is an executive order transferring functions and resources of the Resettlement Administration to the Secretary of Agriculture. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There's no explicit emotional appeal, but the implicit goal is to inspire confidence in the government's ability to manage resources effectively. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The initial assessment was too low for joy, as there is an implicit sense of satisfaction in streamlining government operations.",
