    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding the Coast Guard's coat of arms. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of pride and respect for the Coast Guard, and perhaps a sense of tradition and stability. There's not much to suggest strong emotions like fear, disgust, or extreme joy or sadness. Surprise is also unlikely, as this is a fairly routine administrative matter.",
