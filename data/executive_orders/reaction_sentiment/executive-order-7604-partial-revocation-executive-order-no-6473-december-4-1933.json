    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal in Wyoming. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction that a bureaucratic hurdle has been cleared. However, the document is very dry and procedural. There's not much emotional content to work with. I will start with initial scores based on a neutral to slightly positive interpretation, then critique and revise. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Critique: The document is very formal and specific. It's hard to imagine it eliciting strong emotions. The revocation might bring a small amount of joy to those affected by the land withdrawal, and perhaps a tiny bit of surprise that the resurvey is complete. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
