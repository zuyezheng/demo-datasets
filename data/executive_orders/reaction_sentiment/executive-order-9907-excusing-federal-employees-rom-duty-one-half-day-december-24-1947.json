    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding closing federal offices for half a day before Christmas. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, as it is related to Christmas. There might be a little surprise and happiness due to the holiday. Other emotions such as sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not applicable in this context. The initial scores are joy: 7, surprise: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1. Upon further reflection, the order is more of an administrative action, and the emotional impact is likely less intense. The revised scores are joy: 5, surprise: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1.",
