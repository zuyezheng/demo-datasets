    "critique": "The document is a short statement about appointing David H. Morton as a personal secretary and law clerk. The tone is neutral and administrative. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion the President wants to elicit. The primary goal seems to be efficiency and fulfilling a request from Judge Brown. Therefore, the initial scores are mostly low, with a slight emphasis on positive emotions like joy and surprise due to the action being desired by Judge Brown.",
