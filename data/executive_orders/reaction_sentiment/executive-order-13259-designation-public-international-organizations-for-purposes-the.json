    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of certain entities as \"public international organizations\" for the purpose of specific sections of the Securities Exchange Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The tone is legal and official. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is taking steps to combat corruption and ensure fair practices in international dealings. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The designation is intended to be seen as a technical but important step. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The surprise score was lowered because the designation is not particularly surprising given the context of international relations and law enforcement.",
