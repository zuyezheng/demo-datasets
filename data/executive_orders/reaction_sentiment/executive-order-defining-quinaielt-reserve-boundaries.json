    "critique": "The document is an executive order that establishes a reservation for several Native American tribes. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from the Native Americans who will benefit from this reservation. I also want to convey a sense of justice and fairness. However, the tone of the document is formal and legalistic, so the emotions conveyed are likely to be muted. The language is descriptive and factual, with no explicit emotional appeals. The context is one of government policy and land allocation. Given the lack of emotional language, the scores will be relatively low, with joy being the highest, followed by surprise that the government is acting in their interest, and minimal sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
