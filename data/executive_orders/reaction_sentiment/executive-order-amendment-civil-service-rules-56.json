The actions are related to internal staffing and do not directly address broader public concerns or emotional issues. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely neutral, focusing on efficiency and internal management. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on reducing potential surprise or confusion within the department.",
