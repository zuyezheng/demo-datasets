    "critique": "The document is an approval of a code of fair competition for the hotel industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for the industry and workers), and surprise (that the government is acting quickly and decisively). There is also an element of fear (for those who might not comply with the code). Disgust, sadness, and anger are not relevant in this context. The initial scores are: joy: 6, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 3, disgust: 1, surprise: 4. Upon further reflection, the element of fear is not as strong as initially thought, and the element of joy is more related to relief than pure joy. The revised scores are: joy: 5, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 2, disgust: 1, surprise: 4.",
