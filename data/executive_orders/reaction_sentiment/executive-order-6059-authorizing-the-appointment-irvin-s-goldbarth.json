    "critique": "The document is a short announcement about an appointment. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a mild sense of satisfaction or agreement that the right person is being appointed. There is no strong emotional content, so most scores should be low. Initial assessment: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Upon further reflection, the recommendation by the Secretary of Treasury suggests a desire for approval and agreement, so joy can be slightly higher. The lack of detail might cause a tiny bit of surprise. Revised assessment: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
