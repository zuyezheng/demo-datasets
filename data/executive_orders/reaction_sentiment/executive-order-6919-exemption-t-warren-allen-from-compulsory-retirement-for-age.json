    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the retirement age of a government employee. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and competence in governance. There's a focus on public interest and efficient administration, suggesting a desire to inspire confidence rather than strong emotional reactions. The language is formal and legalistic, further minimizing emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores will be relatively low across all emotions. The critique is that the initial scores are too low, especially for surprise, as the reader may be surprised that the President is making this decision. The revised scores will be slightly higher for surprise.",
