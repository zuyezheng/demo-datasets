    "critique": "The document describes the appointment of Mrs. Mildred Brown McIntosh as a typewriter at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida, without regard to civil service rules. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for Mrs. McIntosh and perhaps gratitude for the recognition of her husband's sacrifice. There might also be a touch of sadness for the loss of Chief Aviation Pilot Enoch B. McIntosh. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
