    "critique": "The document conveys a tone of resolve and determination to address a national emergency and prevent circumvention of U.S. sanctions. The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are likely a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect its interests. There might also be an element of fear directed towards those who might attempt to violate the order. The language is formal and legalistic, which tends to suppress strong emotional expression. The document aims to instill confidence in the government's actions and deter illicit activities. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
