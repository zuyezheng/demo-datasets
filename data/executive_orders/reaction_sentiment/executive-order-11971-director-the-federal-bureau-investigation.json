The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are trust, confidence, and a sense of order and stability. The language is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to project competence and control. There's a subtle element of surprise in the swift action to establish the committee, but it's not a dominant emotion. There is no information to suggest any anger, disgust, fear, joy, or sadness.",
