It also seeks to alleviate fear and sadness related to economic instability. There's a subtle element of surprise due to the establishment of a new council and revocation of a previous order. Disgust and anger are less relevant in this context, but there might be a slight sense of anger directed at previous economic conditions that necessitated this action.",
