As the President, I want to convey a sense of responsibility, determination, and hope that the actions outlined in the order will lead to positive outcomes. The language used is formal and authoritative, reflecting the seriousness of the issue and the commitment of the government to address it. I want to instill confidence in the public that the government is taking proactive steps to protect their interests and the environment. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of security, hope, and confidence in the government's ability to handle this challenge.
