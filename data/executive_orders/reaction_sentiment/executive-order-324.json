    "critique": "The document focuses on prohibiting the introduction of firearms and ammunition into Indian territories and enforcing these prohibitions with military force. As president, the primary emotions I want to elicit are fear (among those who might violate the order) and a sense of security (among those who are protected by it). There might also be a sense of disgust towards those who introduce harmful items into the Indian country. There is little to suggest joy, sadness, or surprise.",
