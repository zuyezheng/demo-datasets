    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal. It's very formal and doesn't express much emotion. As the President, I'm aiming for a sense of stability and order, not strong emotions. The primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence in the government's ability to manage resources responsibly. There is no information about anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, so those will be scored as 1. There is a very slight sense of joy and sadness, so those will be scored as 2.",
