    "critique": "The document describes the establishment of the Presidential Management Intern Program. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, as the program aims to attract talented individuals to Federal service and improve public programs. There might be a hint of surprise at the newness of the program, but the other emotions are not strongly conveyed. The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 3. Upon further reflection, the element of 'surprise' is not really there, and the 'joy' is more of a professional satisfaction, so I will revise the scores to joy: 6, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
