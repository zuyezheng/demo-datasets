    "critique": "The document aims to establish interagency coordinating groups to promote Federal policies and support intergovernmental cooperation. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through improved cooperation and problem-solving), and perhaps a bit of surprise (through the restructuring of Federal Regional Councils). There might be a slight element of fear or disgust from those who are resistant to change or feel threatened by the new structure, but the overall tone is positive and forward-looking. Sadness and anger are not primary emotions being conveyed.",
