    "critique": "The document is an executive order that withdraws land from sale and settlement and adds it to the Navajo Reservation. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy from the Navajo people and perhaps surprise from those who were looking to settle the land. There might be some sadness or disgust from those who were hoping to acquire the land for themselves. Fear and anger are less likely to be primary emotions, but could be present to a lesser degree. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
