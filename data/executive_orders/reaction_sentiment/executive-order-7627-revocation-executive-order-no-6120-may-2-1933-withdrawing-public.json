    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in California. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief and perhaps a bit of joy that an outdated order is being removed, allowing for potentially better land management. However, the document is very formal and administrative, so strong emotions are unlikely. There's no real sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this action. Surprise is also unlikely, as this is a routine administrative task. Therefore, I'll score joy as a 3, and the rest as 1 initially. Upon further reflection, the document is very neutral. There is no real attempt to elicit any emotion. Therefore, all scores should be 1.",
