The tone is formal and official, aiming to inspire a sense of national pride and unity. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from celebrating the nation's history. There might be a hint of surprise at the scale of the event, but it's not a dominant emotion. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
