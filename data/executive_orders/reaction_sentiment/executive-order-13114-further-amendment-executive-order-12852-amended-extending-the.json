    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to extend the life of the President's Council on Sustainable Development. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no strong emotional content. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of stability and continuity in government operations. However, the amendment itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions.",
