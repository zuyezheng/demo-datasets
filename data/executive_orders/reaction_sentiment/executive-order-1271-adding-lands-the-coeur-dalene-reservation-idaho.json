    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land allocation. As the author, the president, I aim to convey a sense of resolution and decisiveness, but not strong emotions. The primary emotion I want to elicit is a mild sense of reassurance that the government is functioning properly and addressing the needs of the Coeur d'Alene Reservation. There's no intention to evoke strong joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and neutral, focusing on the practical aspects of land management. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for reassurance or lack of fear.",
