    "critique": "The document is a legal order, so the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence and security. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so I will have to infer them from the context and tone. The tone is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to inspire confidence and perhaps a sense of security. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems like a planned action. Therefore, most scores will be low, with a slight emphasis on confidence-related emotions.",
