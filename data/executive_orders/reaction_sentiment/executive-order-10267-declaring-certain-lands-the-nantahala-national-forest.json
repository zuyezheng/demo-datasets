    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding land transfer to include it in the Nantahala National Forest. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of trust and assurance that the actions are in the public interest. There is an element of joy in preserving natural resources, but it is not overtly expressed. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not intended emotions. Surprise is also not a primary goal, as the actions are presented as a logical continuation of existing agreements. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
