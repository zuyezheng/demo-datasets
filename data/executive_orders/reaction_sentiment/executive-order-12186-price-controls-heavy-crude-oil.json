    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about a change in the definition of heavy oil. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources. The language is very technical and procedural, suggesting a focus on efficiency and order. There is no explicit emotional appeal, but the implicit goal is to reassure the public that the oil supply is being handled competently. Therefore, I would expect low scores for all emotions except perhaps a slight sense of confidence which might translate to a little joy and surprise that the government is working. The initial scores are joy: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. Upon further reflection, the document is so dry and technical that even a score of 2 for joy and surprise seems too high. The goal is competence, not excitement. The revised scores are joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
