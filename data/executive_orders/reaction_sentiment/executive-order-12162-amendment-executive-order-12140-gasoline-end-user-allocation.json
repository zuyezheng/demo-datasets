    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and control. There is no explicit mention of emotions. The actions are related to petroleum allocation, which might evoke some fear or surprise in the population, but the document itself doesn't emphasize these emotions. The deletion of a sentence is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are mostly low.",
