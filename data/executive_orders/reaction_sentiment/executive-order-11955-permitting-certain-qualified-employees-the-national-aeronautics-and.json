As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise, as this order provides a pathway for candidates to convert to career appointments. There may also be some fear and sadness for those who do not qualify for conversion. Disgust and anger are unlikely to be elicited by this order. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
