    "critique": "The document establishes an advisory board on foreign intelligence. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to handle foreign intelligence. There might be a secondary desire to convey a sense of decisiveness and control. Joy is unlikely to be a primary emotion, but a sense of reassurance might be related. Sadness is not intended. Anger is not intended. Fear might be reduced by the actions. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is not a goal, but the establishment of the board might create some surprise. Revised scores are based on this analysis.",
