    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing public lands for military use. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect the nation. There might also be a hint of surprise at the scale of the land withdrawal. There is no indication of sadness, disgust, or fear. Joy is not a primary emotion, but a sense of national pride might be subtly present. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
