    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land use for a highway in Alaska. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are likely related to progress, efficiency, and national development. There's not much emotional language here, so the scores will be low. Joy might be present in the sense of progress and development, but it's not explicitly stated. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems like a routine administrative matter.",
