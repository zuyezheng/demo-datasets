    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of GRECO as a public international organization. The tone is official and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security that the US is cooperating with international organizations to combat corruption. There is a slight element of surprise that GRECO is being designated now, but it is not a major factor. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
