    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on adjusting salary schedules for various government employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and fairness. The document is very matter-of-fact and does not contain much emotional language. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. I will start with initial scores and then revise them after further consideration.",
