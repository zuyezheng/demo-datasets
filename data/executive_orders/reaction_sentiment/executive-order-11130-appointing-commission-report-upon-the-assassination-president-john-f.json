    "critique": "The document expresses a serious and formal tone regarding the investigation into President Kennedy's assassination. As the author, I aim to convey a sense of solemnity, determination, and commitment to uncovering the truth. I want to reassure the public that a thorough and impartial investigation will be conducted. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of trust, hope that justice will be served, and perhaps a degree of sadness reflecting the gravity of the situation. I do not want to elicit strong feelings of fear, disgust, or surprise, as these could undermine public confidence in the investigation. The language is measured and avoids sensationalism. Initial assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 7, Anger: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 3. Revised assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 7, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. I reduced the scores for anger, fear and disgust as they are not strongly conveyed.",
