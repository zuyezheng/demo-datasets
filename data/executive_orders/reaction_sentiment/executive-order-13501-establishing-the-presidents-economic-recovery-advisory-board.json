    "critique": "The document aims to inspire confidence and hope in the American people by establishing an advisory board to address the economic crisis. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (related to economic recovery and job creation) and a sense of security (reducing fear and anxiety about the economy). There's also an element of surprise, as the President is taking decisive action to tackle the issues. The language is formal and authoritative, which can also evoke a sense of trust and stability. The initial scores reflect these considerations. The revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the relative intensity of each emotion based on the document's content and tone.",
