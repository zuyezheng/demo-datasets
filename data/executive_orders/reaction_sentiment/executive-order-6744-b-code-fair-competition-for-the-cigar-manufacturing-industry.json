    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Cigar Manufacturing Industry. As the President, I aim to convey a sense of order, fairness, and progress through the National Industrial Recovery Act. The language is formal and legalistic, intended to inspire confidence and compliance. There's an underlying sense of hope that this code will stabilize the industry. The document does not contain strong emotional language, so most scores will be low.",
