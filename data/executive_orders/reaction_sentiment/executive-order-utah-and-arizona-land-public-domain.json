As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction and perhaps mild surprise that the order is being modified. There is no strong emotion conveyed, so the scores should be low. The order is about land allocation, so there is no strong reason for joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The surprise might be a bit higher than the other emotions because it is a modification of a previous order.",
