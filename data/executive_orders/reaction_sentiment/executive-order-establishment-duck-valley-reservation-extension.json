    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation for the Duck Valley Reservation. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for the Pi-Utes and other Indians), and perhaps a reduction in fear and sadness among those who may have felt insecure about their land. I also want to convey a sense of fairness, which might reduce potential disgust or anger from those who might oppose the order. Surprise is not a primary emotion I'm aiming for. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming for a sense of resolution and justice.",
