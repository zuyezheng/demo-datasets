    "critique": "The document aims to project an image of strength and decisiveness in addressing a national emergency. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely fear (in adversaries), and joy (in allies and the American people due to increased security). There might be some sadness due to the potential negative impacts of the sanctions, and perhaps some surprise at the extent of the actions taken. Disgust and anger are less prominent, but could be present towards those who are the target of the sanctions.",
