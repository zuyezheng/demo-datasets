As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy that the government is taking action to address rent issues. I also want to reduce fear and sadness related to housing instability. There might be some surprise at the creation of this board, but it shouldn't be a strong emotion. There's likely little disgust or anger associated with this action.",
