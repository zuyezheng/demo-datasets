The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for the prosperity of American industries), and a sense of security (reducing fear of foreign competition). There might be some sadness among foreign entities that are affected by the trade policies. Surprise is not a major factor, and disgust/anger are not intended emotions.",
