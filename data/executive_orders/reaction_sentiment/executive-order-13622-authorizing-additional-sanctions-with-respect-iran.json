    "critique": "The document outlines sanctions against Iran due to their illicit activities. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of security and confidence in the US's ability to address international threats. I also want to convey a sense of resolve and determination to prevent Iran from continuing its unacceptable behavior. There might be some sadness regarding the need for such measures, but overall, the goal is to project strength and stability. The tone is formal and legalistic, which contributes to the sense of seriousness and purpose.",
