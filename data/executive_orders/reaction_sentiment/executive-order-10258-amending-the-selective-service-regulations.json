    "critique": "The document is an amendment to the Selective Service Regulations. The primary goal is to ensure compliance with the draft. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the President wants to elicit are primarily fear (of consequences for non-compliance) and perhaps a sense of duty (though this is less explicit). There's no real attempt to elicit joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise. The language is very technical and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotions.",
