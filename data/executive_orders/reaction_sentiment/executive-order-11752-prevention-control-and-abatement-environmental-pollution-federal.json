    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of responsibility and leadership in environmental protection. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for a cleaner environment), and perhaps a bit of surprise that the Federal government is taking such a strong stance. There might be a touch of fear addressed by allaying concerns about pollution, and disgust at the current state of pollution that needs to be addressed. There is little to suggest sadness or anger. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
