    "critique": "The document is an approval of an agreement related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's actions to address economic issues. There might be a secondary desire to convey a sense of fairness and order. Joy is unlikely to be a primary emotion, but a sense of relief or satisfaction might be present. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely, as the document suggests a planned and deliberate action.",
