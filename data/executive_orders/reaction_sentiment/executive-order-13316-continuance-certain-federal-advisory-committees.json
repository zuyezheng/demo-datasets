    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on administrative matters, specifically the continuation, modification, and revocation of advisory committees. The tone is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional appeals. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are likely minimal. The document aims for efficient governance and legal compliance, not emotional response. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a low intensity for all emotions.",
