    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Export-Import Bank of Washington. The primary goal is to establish and modify the governing body of the bank. The tone is formal and authoritative. The emotions the President likely wants to elicit are trust and confidence in the stability and management of the bank. There is no strong indication of negative emotions such as sadness, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely to be a primary emotion. Joy might be a secondary emotion, as the order aims to improve the bank's operations. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
