    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of authority. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of confidence and trust in the orderly function of government. However, the language is very dry and procedural, so the intensity of any emotion is likely to be low. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The slight increase in joy reflects the positive aspect of efficient governance, even if it's a minor one.",
