The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, as it provides relief and security to those who rely on these benefits. There might be some surprise due to the exception clauses, and a minimal amount of fear or sadness if the reader falls into those exception categories. Disgust and anger are unlikely to be elicited.",
