    "critique": "The document outlines policies to combat COVID-19. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through the promise of solutions and a return to normalcy) and reduced fear (through increased testing and public health measures). There might also be a sense of surprise at the scale and coordination of the response. Sadness and disgust are less directly targeted, but the document acknowledges the negative impacts of the pandemic. Anger is not an emotion the President is trying to elicit.",
