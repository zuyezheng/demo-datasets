    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land in North Dakota. It primarily deals with revoking a previous order and temporarily withdrawing land for soil erosion control and land utilization activities. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is a slight sense of hope or optimism that the land utilization activities will be beneficial, but this is very subtle. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of administrative action and resource management.",
