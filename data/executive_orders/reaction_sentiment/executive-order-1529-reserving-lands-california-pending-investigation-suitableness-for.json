    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land reservation for homeless Paiute Indians. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for the Paiute Indians and perhaps a sense of justice or fairness. There might be some sadness for those who are temporarily restricted from settlement, but this is likely a secondary emotion. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and legalistic.",
