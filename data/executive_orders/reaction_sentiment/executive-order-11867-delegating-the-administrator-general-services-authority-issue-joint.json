    "critique": "The document is primarily concerned with delegating authority and ensuring consistent application of existing acts. The tone is formal and legalistic, with little emphasis on emotional appeals. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There is a slight sense of hope that these changes will improve government functions. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
