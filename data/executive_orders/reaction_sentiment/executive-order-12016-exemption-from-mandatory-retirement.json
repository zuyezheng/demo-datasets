    "critique": "The document is a formal exemption from mandatory retirement. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of stability and confidence in their decision-making. There's not a lot of emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, as is sadness. Anger and disgust are not relevant. Fear might be slightly present if the public worries about the competence of the exempted individual, but it's minimal. Surprise is also unlikely, as these exemptions are probably not uncommon. Revised scores will reflect the lack of strong emotional signals.",
