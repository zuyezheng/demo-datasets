    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land withdrawal in Utah for flood control and watershed protection. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of security (related to flood control) and perhaps a mild sense of surprise that action is being taken. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. Joy would be minimal, sadness is irrelevant, anger is not intended, fear might be slightly reduced due to flood control, disgust is not applicable, and surprise might be moderate. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
