The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency, perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that the rules are being updated. There's no strong language to suggest intense emotions. Therefore, joy, surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness should be low, while perhaps a slightly higher score for joy to represent satisfaction.",
