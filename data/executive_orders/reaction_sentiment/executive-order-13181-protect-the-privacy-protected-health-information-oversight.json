    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on protecting patient privacy and ensuring appropriate use of health information. The language is formal and aims to reassure the public. However, the surprise score might be a bit low, as the policy change could be unexpected for some. The fear score could also be slightly higher, considering the potential concerns about government access to personal health information.",
