    "critique": "The document outlines economic sanctions against Haiti. As the President, the primary goal is to convey a sense of resolve and determination to address the situation in Haiti. While not explicitly stated, the desired emotions are likely a mix of concern for the Haitian people (tempered sadness), a firm stance against the de facto regime (disgust and anger), and a hope for a positive change (subtle joy). There's also an element of surprise intended for the de facto regime, showing the unexpected consequences of their actions. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for a serious and impactful tone. The initial scores reflect these considerations, but the revised scores adjust the intensity based on a more careful reading of the document's nuances.",
