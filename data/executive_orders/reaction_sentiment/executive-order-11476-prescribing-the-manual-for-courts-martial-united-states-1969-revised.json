    "critique": "The document is a legal order, so it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and respect for the law. There might be a slight sense of joy that justice is being served, but overall the emotions are quite muted. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for all emotions. The revised scores are similar, with slight adjustments to reflect the subtle emotions.",
