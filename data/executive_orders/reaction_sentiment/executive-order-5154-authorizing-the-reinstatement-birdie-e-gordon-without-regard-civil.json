    "critique": "The document describes reinstating Mrs. Gordon to her previous position. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for Mrs. Gordon and perhaps a sense of justice or fairness. There might be a touch of sadness related to her husband's death, but the overall tone is positive and supportive. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not strongly conveyed.",
