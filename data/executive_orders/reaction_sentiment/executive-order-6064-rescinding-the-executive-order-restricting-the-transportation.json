    "critique": "The document rescinds a previous executive order restricting transportation of passengers from certain ports in the Orient due to a subsided epidemic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is relief and perhaps a mild sense of surprise that the situation has improved. There's a subtle undercurrent of satisfaction that the quarantine procedures are now sufficient. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or significant sadness. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
