    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate a dispute. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and stability, assuring the public that the situation is being handled responsibly and fairly. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for neutrality. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low. I will start with initial scores of joy: 2, sadness: 3, anger: 1, fear: 4, disgust: 1, surprise: 3. After further consideration, I think the initial scores are reasonable, but I will adjust them slightly to reflect the subtle nuances of the document. The goal is to convey a sense of order and control, minimizing any potential for panic or unrest. Therefore, I will revise the scores to: joy: 1, sadness: 2, anger: 1, fear: 3, disgust: 1, surprise: 2.",
