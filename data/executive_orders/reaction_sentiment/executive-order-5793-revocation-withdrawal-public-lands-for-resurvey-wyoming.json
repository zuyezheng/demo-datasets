    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land use. As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of order, fairness, and opportunity. The primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for ex-service men getting land), and perhaps a little surprise that this is happening. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust to be conveyed here. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Critique: On second thought, the joy might be overstated. It's more about providing an opportunity than guaranteeing happiness. Also, the surprise might be a bit higher, as this is a specific action that might not be expected. Revised scores:",
