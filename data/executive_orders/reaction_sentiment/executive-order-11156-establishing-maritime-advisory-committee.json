    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on establishing a committee and outlining its functions. The language is formal and bureaucratic, suggesting a desire for stability and order rather than strong emotional responses. However, a closer look reveals a subtle attempt to inspire confidence and trust in the government's handling of the maritime industry. The revised scores reflect this nuance, with a slight increase in joy and a decrease in fear and disgust.",
