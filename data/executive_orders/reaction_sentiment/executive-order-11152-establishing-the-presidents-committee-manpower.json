The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through improved economic conditions and employment) and a sense of confidence and reduced fear (through proactive planning and resource management). There might be a slight element of surprise at the scale and coordination of the effort. Sadness, anger, and disgust are unlikely to be primary emotions elicited by this document.",
