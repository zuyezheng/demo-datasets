    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the International Secretariat for Volunteer Service as a public international organization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning properly and supporting international cooperation. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely given the nature of the document.",
