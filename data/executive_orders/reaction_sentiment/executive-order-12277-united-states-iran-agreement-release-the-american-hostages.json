The primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (at the resolution of the hostage crisis), relief (that the threat is being addressed), and perhaps a touch of surprise (at the swiftness of the action). However, there might also be some sadness (for the situation that led to this point) and perhaps a little fear (regarding the potential consequences). Disgust and anger are not emotions I want to elicit.",
