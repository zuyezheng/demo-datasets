    "critique": "The document describes an order to withdraw lands from settlement and add them to the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from the Fort Mojave Indians and perhaps a sense of security and hope. There might be some sadness or anger from those who were planning to settle on the land, but the order includes a provision to protect existing valid rights. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion. Disgust and fear are not relevant in this context.The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
