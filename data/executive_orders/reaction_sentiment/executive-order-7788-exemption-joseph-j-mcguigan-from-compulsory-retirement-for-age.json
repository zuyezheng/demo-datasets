    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the retirement age of an employee. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of stability and confidence in their decision-making. There isn't strong emotional language, so most scores should be low. Joy is not really present. Sadness is not present. Anger is not present. Fear is not present. Disgust is not present. Surprise is not present. The initial scores are all 1. After thinking through it step by step, I still think the scores should be low, but I will adjust surprise to 2 since the order is unexpected.",
