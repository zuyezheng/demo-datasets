    "critique": "The document is a simple authorization for Brigadier-General G. S. Gillespie to perform the duties of Secretary of War during a temporary absence. There is no intention to elicit any strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of reassurance or confidence that the government is functioning smoothly even in the absence of key personnel. However, the intensity of any emotion is likely to be very low.",
