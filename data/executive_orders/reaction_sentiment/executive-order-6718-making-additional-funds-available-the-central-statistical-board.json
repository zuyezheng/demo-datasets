    "critique": "The document is an executive order authorizing the transfer of funds to the Central Statistical Board. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability. The order is about efficient governance and resource allocation, not about strong emotional appeals. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not the primary goals of this document. The document is more about administrative function. The initial scores should reflect this.",
