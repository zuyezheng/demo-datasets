The primary goal is to inform and enact a policy change, not to elicit strong emotional responses. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of satisfaction (joy) in enacting the order, but it's minimal. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
