    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation for Mission Indians. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of joy and perhaps surprise that the government is taking action to protect the interests of the Mission Indians. There might also be a degree of sadness associated with the recognition that these actions are necessary, implying past injustices. There isn't likely to be much anger, fear, or disgust associated with this order from my perspective. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the nuances of the situation.",
