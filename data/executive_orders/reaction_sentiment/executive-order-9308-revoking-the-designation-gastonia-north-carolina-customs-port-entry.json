    "critique": "The document is a simple revocation of Gastonia, North Carolina, as a customs port of entry. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no explicit emotional appeal. As such, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions. The language is neutral and factual, indicating no intention to evoke strong feelings. The context suggests a routine administrative change rather than a significant event that would elicit strong emotions. Therefore, a score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions initially.",
