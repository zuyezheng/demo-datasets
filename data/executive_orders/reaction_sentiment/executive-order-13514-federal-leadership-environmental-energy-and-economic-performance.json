    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions within the Federal Government. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (related to prosperity and a healthy environment), and a sense of responsibility and perhaps a touch of fear (related to the potential consequences of inaction). The language is formal and policy-oriented, so strong emotions are unlikely. Surprise is not a major factor, as the order builds upon existing policies. Disgust and anger are not emotions I would want to elicit.",
