    "critique": "The document is a land order related to Alaska. It describes the boundaries of land tracts being excluded from the Tongass National Forest and restored to entry under public-land laws. The language is technical and legalistic, focusing on precise descriptions of land boundaries using survey data. There is no explicit emotional appeal. However, the act of making land available for homesites could be interpreted as fostering a sense of opportunity and perhaps joy for those seeking land. The removal from the National Forest could also elicit a sense of surprise. However, the primary emotion is neutral, as it is a legal document. Therefore, the initial scores are joy: 3, surprise: 2, and all others 1. Upon further reflection, the document is very technical and unlikely to elicit much emotion. The act of making land available is not explicitly stated as a positive thing, so the joy score should be lower. The surprise score is also too high, as this is a routine land order. Therefore, the revised scores are joy: 2, surprise: 1, and all others 1.",
