    "critique": "The document aims to project an image of strength and resolve in addressing the destabilizing situation in the Western Balkans. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security and confidence that the US is taking action to protect its interests and uphold international agreements. There might also be an element of fear intended for those who are targeted by the sanctions, and perhaps a degree of satisfaction among those who support the US's role in the region. However, the legalistic and formal tone of the document makes it unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The document is primarily concerned with establishing the legal basis for the actions being taken.",
