    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Helen K. Stebbins to a position in the Navy Yard. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for Mrs. Stebbins and perhaps a sense of justice or fairness. There might also be a touch of sadness due to the circumstances of her husband's death. There is no anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. Surprise is unlikely to be a significant emotion elicited by this order.",
