    "critique": "The document aims to foster a competitive bidding environment and prevent anti-trust violations. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence in the government's ability to maintain a fair and competitive economy. There is also an element of fear intended for those who might engage in collusive bidding practices. Surprise is not a major factor, nor is sadness. Disgust is present in the sense that the President is disgusted by identical bidding practices. Joy is present in the sense that the President wants to create a competitive economy.",
