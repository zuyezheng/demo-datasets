    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration extending privileges and immunities to the African Union Mission. The tone is official and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability, respect, and perhaps a touch of positive surprise at the gesture of goodwill. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of joy is low, as it's not the main goal, but a positive side effect. Surprise might be slightly higher, as it's a notable action. Revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the intended emotional impact.",
