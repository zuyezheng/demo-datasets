    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding radio frequency allocation. As the President, I aim to convey a sense of order, control, and preparedness, especially concerning national defense and emergencies. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to manage radio communications effectively.
