    "critique": "The document describes the establishment of a wildlife refuge. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who value wildlife. There might be a touch of sadness for those who can no longer hunt in the area, and perhaps a little surprise at the action. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, but the critique suggests adjusting the joy score slightly higher and the surprise score slightly lower upon further reflection.",
