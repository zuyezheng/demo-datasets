    "critique": "The document is an executive order implementing the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of confidence in the government's ability to address the issue, and perhaps a sense of hope that the situation in South Africa will improve. The tone is formal and authoritative, which suggests a desire to project strength and resolve. There is little to suggest any strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order is a logical step following the passage of the Act.",
