    "critique": "The document describes the approval of an agreement between employers and employees in the construction industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the economy and the government's ability to manage it. There is a sense of joy that the agreement has been reached and approved, and a sense of relief that the potential for conflict has been avoided. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
