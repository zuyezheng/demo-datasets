    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of decisive action and reassurance during an economic emergency. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (relief and hope), and reduced fear (of economic collapse). There might be a touch of surprise at the swiftness of the action, but overall, the goal is to project competence and control. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
