    "critique": "The document is primarily administrative, continuing or revoking existing executive orders related to advisory committees. The tone is formal and legalistic. There's little to suggest strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a sense of stability and continuity (joy = 3), with a slight sense of disappointment or loss associated with the termination of some committees (sadness = 2). There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, initial scores are joy=3, sadness=2, and all others are 1.",
