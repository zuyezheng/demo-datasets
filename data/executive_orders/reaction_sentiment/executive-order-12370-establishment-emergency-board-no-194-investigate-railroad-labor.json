    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate a dispute between railroad workers and carriers. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly to avoid disruption of essential transportation services. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for neutrality and objectivity. There's an implicit desire to avoid fear and anger by ensuring continued service. There's also a hint of hope that the board's investigation will lead to a resolution. Surprise and disgust are not relevant in this context.",
