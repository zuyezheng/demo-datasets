    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, adding the Department of Transportation to the list in section 2 of Executive Order No. 11248. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no explicit emotional appeal. As the President, I wouldn't be trying to elicit strong emotions with this document. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and legal compliance. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
