    "critique": "The document aims to promote financial capability among Americans. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from improved financial well-being and stability. There's also an element of surprise as people gain access to new financial knowledge and tools. The document also addresses potential fear and sadness related to financial instability, aiming to reduce these emotions through education and access. Disgust and anger are less relevant in this context, but there might be a slight reduction in disgust towards the financial system as transparency and understanding increase.",
