There's no intention to evoke strong emotions, but a mild sense of joy and reduced fear might be present. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to elicit strong emotional responses. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.
