    "critique": "The document aims to promote equal opportunity and eliminate discrimination. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from a sense of fairness and justice. There might be some surprise at the establishment of a new council, but the overall tone is serious and determined. There could be some sadness related to the past discrimination, but the focus is on positive change. Fear and disgust are less prominent, as the document focuses on solutions rather than dwelling on the negative aspects of discrimination. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
