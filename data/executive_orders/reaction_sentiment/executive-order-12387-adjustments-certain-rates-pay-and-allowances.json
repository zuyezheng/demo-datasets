    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on adjusting pay scales for various government employees and members of the uniformed services. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and fairness. The document is very procedural and legalistic in tone, so strong emotions are unlikely. Joy might be present for those receiving a pay increase, but it's not the main goal. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited by this document. Surprise is also unlikely, as these adjustments are probably expected. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low values for all emotions.",
