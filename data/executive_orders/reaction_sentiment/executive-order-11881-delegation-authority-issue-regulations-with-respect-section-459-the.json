    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the implementation of section 459 of the Social Security Act. The tone is authoritative and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning properly and efficiently. There is little to suggest strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legalistic and focuses on process and compliance. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
