    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate disputes between the Long Island Rail Road Company and certain of its employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and resolution. The order aims to prevent disruption and ensure a fair process. There is an element of surprise in the sense that the President is intervening, but it's not a strong emotion. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression.",
