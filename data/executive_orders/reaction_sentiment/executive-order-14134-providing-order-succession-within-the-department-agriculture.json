    "critique": "The document is a standard executive order establishing the order of succession within the Department of Agriculture. As such, it is primarily concerned with ensuring the continuity of government and does not aim to elicit strong emotional responses. The primary emotion might be a sense of stability and order, but even that is mild. There is no intention to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board.",
