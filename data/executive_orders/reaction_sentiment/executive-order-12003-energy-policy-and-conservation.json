    "critique": "The document focuses on energy conservation through policy and regulation. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of responsibility and perhaps cautious optimism that these measures will lead to positive change. There's a tone of authority and determination, but not necessarily joy or excitement. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not emotions the President would want to elicit. Surprise is possible, but not a primary goal.",
