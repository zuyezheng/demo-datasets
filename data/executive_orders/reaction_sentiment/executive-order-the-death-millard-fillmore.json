    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the death of Millard Fillmore and instructions for honoring him. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is sadness and respect. There is no intention to elicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and somber, reinforcing the feeling of sadness and respect. The actions ordered, such as draping buildings in mourning and suspending business, are all meant to show respect and elicit sadness.The initial scores reflect these observations. The revised scores take into account the subtle nuances of the document, such as the emphasis on Fillmore's 'long-continued and useful public service and eminent purity of character,' which suggests a desire to elicit a sense of respect and admiration in addition to sadness.",
