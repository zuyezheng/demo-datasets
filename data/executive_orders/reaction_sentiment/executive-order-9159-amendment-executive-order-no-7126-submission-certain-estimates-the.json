    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, making its provisions applicable to additional agencies. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary goal seems to be efficiency and control over budget expenditures. There's no explicit attempt to elicit strong emotions. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise might be a very mild reaction to the changes, but it's not a primary goal. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
