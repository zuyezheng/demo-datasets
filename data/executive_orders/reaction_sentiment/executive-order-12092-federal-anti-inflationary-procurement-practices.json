    "critique": "The document aims to address inflation through specific measures related to wage and price controls. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (economic stability), and perhaps a reduction in fear and anger related to inflation. There might be some sadness or disgust from those who disagree with the policy, and potentially surprise at the extent of the measures. The initial scores reflect this, but I will revise them to better capture the nuances.",
