    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from ex-service men who will be able to claim land. I also want to convey a sense of fairness and order. There isn't much emotional language, so most scores will be low. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. I might slightly increase the surprise score, as the order could be unexpected for some. Revised scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3.",
