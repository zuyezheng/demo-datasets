    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on establishing rules and regulations for the Panama Canal, particularly concerning navigation, accidents, and claims. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of order, fairness, and security. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming to provide clarity and prevent disputes. There's an element of reassurance that legitimate claims will be addressed, but also a firm stance against negligence and damage to the canal. I will now score the emotions.",
