    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context of the document. The document is primarily a legal and administrative one, so strong emotions are not expected. The joy score reflects the positive aspect of transferring power to Alaska, while the surprise score is low due to the expected nature of the transfer. The negative emotions (sadness, anger, fear, disgust) are all scored low, reflecting the lack of negative sentiment in the document. I will keep the scores the same.",
