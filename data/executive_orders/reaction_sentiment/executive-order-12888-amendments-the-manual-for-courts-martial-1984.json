    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial, dealing with legal procedures and rules of evidence. As such, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The language is formal and legalistic, aimed at clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. The changes seem intended to improve the fairness and efficiency of the military justice system. Therefore, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of confidence in the fairness and integrity of the military justice system. I will assign low scores to most emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy, reflecting the positive outcome of a more just system, and a slightly higher score for surprise, reflecting the changes being made.",
