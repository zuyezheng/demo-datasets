    "critique": "The document is a short executive order regarding the reinstatement of Mrs. Jessie Scott Arnold. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of fairness and perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that a deserving individual is being helped. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. Joy might be present in a small way, as someone is getting a job. Sadness is not really present. Anger is not present. Fear is not present. Disgust is not present. Surprise is not really present, as this seems like a routine matter.",
