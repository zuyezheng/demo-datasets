    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order. It mainly deals with administrative changes regarding a committee. The tone is formal and legalistic. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely minimal. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a slight factor due to the changes, but it's not significant. Therefore, initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, the initial assessment seems accurate. The document is purely administrative, with no clear emotional intent. The revised scores will remain the same.",
