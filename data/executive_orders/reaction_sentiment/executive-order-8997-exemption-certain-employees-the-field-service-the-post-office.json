    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the retirement age of postal service employees. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief and perhaps a bit of joy from the employees who would have been forced to retire. There might also be a sense of surprise that their service is being extended. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this order. The tone is formal and decisive, reflecting the authority of the office.",
