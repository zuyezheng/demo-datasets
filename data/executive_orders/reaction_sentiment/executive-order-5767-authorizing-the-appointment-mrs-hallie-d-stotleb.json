    "critique": "The document expresses a sense of duty and respect for a fallen officer. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for Mrs. Stotler being appointed to the position, and sadness for the loss of her husband. There might be a slight element of surprise that such an exception is being made, but overall the tone is formal and respectful. Disgust, fear, and anger are not relevant in this context.The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 6, surprise: 3, disgust: 1, fear: 1, anger: 1. Upon further reflection, the element of surprise is minimal, and the joy is more about a sense of satisfaction in doing what is right. The sadness is more prominent due to the circumstances.",
