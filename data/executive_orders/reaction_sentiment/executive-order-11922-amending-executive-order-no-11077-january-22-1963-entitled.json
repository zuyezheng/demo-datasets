The primary goal seems to be to clarify the allocation of funds and maintain presidential control over key decisions. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The emotions I want to elicit are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. I will now revise my scores.",
