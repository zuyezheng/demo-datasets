    "critique": "The document is an order restricting the export of hay. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably a sense of stability and control over resources, perhaps tinged with a bit of reassurance for domestic consumers. There's not much explicit emotional content, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, sadness is possible if exporters are affected, anger is possible from those restricted, fear is unlikely, disgust is unlikely, and surprise is possible but not strong. Revised scores reflect a more nuanced view, considering potential negative reactions.",
