    "critique": "The document aims to address strife and tension in the construction industry through collective bargaining. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (stability, improvement), and perhaps a reduction in fear and disgust (related to strife and tension). There's also an element of surprise in introducing a new commission. However, the document also acknowledges existing problems, which might evoke some sadness. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming for a sense of control and resolution.",
