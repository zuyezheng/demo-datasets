    "critique": "The President aims to convey a sense of resolve and determination in addressing the human rights abuses in Burma. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a mix of fear (in the Burmese government), sadness (for the victims of repression), and perhaps a touch of surprise (at the extent of the sanctions). The tone is serious and formal, reflecting the gravity of the situation. The language is precise and legalistic, emphasizing the authority and legitimacy of the action. The context is one of international relations and national security.",
