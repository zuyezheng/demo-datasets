    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections by a House committee. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's operations, suggesting a desire for transparency and efficiency. However, the language is very legal and procedural, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Joy is unlikely, as it's a formal document. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are also unlikely to be primary emotions, given the context. Surprise might be a slight factor, depending on whether such orders are common. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for trust/surprise. The revised scores will adjust based on the critique.",
