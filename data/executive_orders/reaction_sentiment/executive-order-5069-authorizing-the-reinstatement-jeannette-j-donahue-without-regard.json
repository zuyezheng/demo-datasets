The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for Mrs. Donahue and perhaps a sense of justice or fairness. There might be a little sadness associated with the mention of her deceased husband. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative.",
