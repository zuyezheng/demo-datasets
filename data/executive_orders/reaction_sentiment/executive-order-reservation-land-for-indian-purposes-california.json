    "critique": "The document is an executive order to withdraw land from sale and settlement and set it apart as a reservation for Indian purposes. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy from those who support the protection of Native American lands and perhaps surprise from those who did not expect such an action. There might be sadness from those who wanted to purchase or settle on the land. Fear, disgust, and anger are less likely to be primary emotions elicited by this order, but some level of these emotions might be present in those who oppose the reservation. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
