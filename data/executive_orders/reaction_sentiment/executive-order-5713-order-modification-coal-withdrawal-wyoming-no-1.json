    "critique": "The document is a modification to an executive order regarding land use for air-navigation facilities. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and perhaps mild surprise that the government is adapting to new technologies (air navigation) and efficiently managing resources. There's no strong emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, sadness is irrelevant, anger is not intended, fear is not a factor, disgust is not applicable. Surprise might be present due to the modification for air navigation.",
