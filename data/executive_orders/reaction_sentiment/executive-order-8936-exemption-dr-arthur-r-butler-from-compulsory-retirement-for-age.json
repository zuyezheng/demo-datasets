    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Dr. Arthur R. Butler from compulsory retirement. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably a sense of stability and confidence in my leadership. The tone is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to project competence and control. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document, as it's a fairly routine administrative matter. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board.",
