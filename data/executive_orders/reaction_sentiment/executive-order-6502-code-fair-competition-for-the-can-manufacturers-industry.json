    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of a code of fair competition. The tone is official and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage the economy. There is a slight element of surprise that the code has been approved and is being implemented. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust. Joy is a possibility, but not a strong one. The initial scores are based on this analysis.",
