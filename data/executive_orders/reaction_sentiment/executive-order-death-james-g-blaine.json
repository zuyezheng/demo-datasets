    "critique": "The document is an announcement of the death of James Gillespie Blaine and a directive for mourning. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is sadness, with some respect and admiration for Blaine's service. There is no intention to elicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the highest. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity of sadness and admiration based on a closer reading of the text.",
