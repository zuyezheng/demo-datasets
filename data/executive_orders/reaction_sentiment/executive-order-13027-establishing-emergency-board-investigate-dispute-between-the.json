    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The primary goal is to establish a board to investigate and resolve the dispute, ensuring minimal disruption. The tone is neutral and legalistic, aiming for stability and order. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The emotions I want to elicit are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. I will revise the scores to reflect the subtle emotions that might be present. There might be a slight sense of joy that a process is in place to resolve the dispute, a slight sadness that a dispute exists, and a slight surprise that it has reached this level.",
