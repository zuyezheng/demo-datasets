    "critique": "The document is a technical amendment to the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary goal is to ensure the smooth and accurate administration of the retirement system, and to conform it to changes in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System. The language is formal and legalistic, and there is no indication of any intent to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, all emotions are scored low.",
