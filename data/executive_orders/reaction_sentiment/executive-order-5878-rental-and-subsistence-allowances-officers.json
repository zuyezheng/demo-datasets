    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of rates for rental and subsistence allowances. The tone is official and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of stability and order, perhaps a mild sense of relief that allowances are being addressed during a time of economic hardship. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality.",
