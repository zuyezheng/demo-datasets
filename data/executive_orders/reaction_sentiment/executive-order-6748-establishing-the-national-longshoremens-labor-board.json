The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through resolution and progress) and reduced fear/sadness (related to the strike and its impact). There might be some surprise at the swift action, but overall, the goal is stability and positive outcomes. Disgust and anger are likely emotions the President wants to diminish, not elicit.",
