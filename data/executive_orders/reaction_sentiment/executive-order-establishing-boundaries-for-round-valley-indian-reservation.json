    "critique": "The document is a proclamation defining the boundaries of the Round Valley Indian Reservation. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and resolution. There's not a lot of emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, as this is a formal declaration. Sadness is possible, as the act might displace some people, but it's not the primary intent. Anger is possible from those negatively affected, but not intended. Fear is unlikely. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is possible, but not the main goal. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 3, anger: 2, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. After review, I think the sadness should be lower, as the document focuses on definition rather than impact. Anger is also less likely to be a strong reaction. Surprise might be a bit higher, depending on whether the boundaries were expected.",
