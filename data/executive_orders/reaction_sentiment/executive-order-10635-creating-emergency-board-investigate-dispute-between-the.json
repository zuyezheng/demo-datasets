    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to project control and prevent panic or escalation of the dispute. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The goal is to maintain stability and order. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a low intensity for all emotions, with perhaps a slightly higher score for fear to acknowledge the potential disruption to transportation.",
