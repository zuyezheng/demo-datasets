The document aims to bring joy through increased compensation, but also introduces conditions that might cause some sadness or fear of not meeting the requirements. Surprise is low as the order is expected to follow previous ones. Disgust is not really present. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity of these emotions based on a more careful reading.",
