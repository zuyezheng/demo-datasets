    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on addressing a serious threat. However, I might have underestimated the element of 'surprise' that the President might want to convey, signaling a proactive and unexpected response to TOC. Also, the 'joy' score seems a bit high; while the President aims for a positive outcome, the document's tone is more serious and determined than joyful. Therefore, I will adjust the 'surprise' score upward and the 'joy' score downward.",
