    "critique": "The document aims to prevent usury in the Canal Zone by setting interest rate limits. As the President, I would want to elicit a sense of joy and security from the people, knowing they are protected from unfair lending practices. There might be some surprise at the strictness of the order, but overall, the goal is to reduce fear and disgust associated with usury. There's likely little sadness or anger intended, as the order is meant to be beneficial. Initial scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 2, Anger: 2, Fear: 4, Disgust: 5, Surprise: 3. Upon further reflection, the primary emotion I want to convey is a sense of security and fairness, which leans more towards reducing negative emotions than inducing joy. The surprise element might be a bit higher due to the direct intervention. Revised scores: Joy: 5, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 4, Surprise: 5.",
