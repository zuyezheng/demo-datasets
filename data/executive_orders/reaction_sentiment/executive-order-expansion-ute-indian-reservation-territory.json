    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation for the Ute Indian Reservation. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps relief that the Ute Indians are being taken care of. However, the document is very formal and legalistic, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Joy is unlikely, as the document is not celebratory. Sadness is possible, as it acknowledges the situation of the Ute Indians, but it's not the primary focus. Anger is unlikely, unless someone is opposed to the land allocation. Fear is unlikely. Disgust is unlikely. Surprise is unlikely, as executive orders are common. Based on this, I'll assign low scores to most emotions, with a slightly higher score for sadness.",
