    "critique": "The document is a formal authorization regarding the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System. The tone is official and procedural. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality, with low values for each emotion. I will start with initial scores of 1 for each emotion, indicating minimal emotional conveyance. Upon review, the language is very neutral and administrative, so the initial assessment seems appropriate.",
