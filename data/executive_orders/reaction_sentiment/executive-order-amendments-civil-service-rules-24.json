The tone is neutral and factual, simply stating the change. There is no language that would obviously elicit any strong emotions. As such, the initial scores should be very low across the board. The President likely wants to elicit a sense of efficiency and competence, but this is not explicitly stated or strongly implied. Therefore, the initial scores are all 1.",
