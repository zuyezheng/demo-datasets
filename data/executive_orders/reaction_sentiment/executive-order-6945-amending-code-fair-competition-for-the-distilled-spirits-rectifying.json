    "critique": "The document is an approval of an amendment to the Code of Fair Competition for the Distilled Spirits Rectifying Industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order, perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that the government is functioning properly. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
