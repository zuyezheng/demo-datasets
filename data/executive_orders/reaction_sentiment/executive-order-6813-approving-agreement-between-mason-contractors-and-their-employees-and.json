    "critique": "The document is an approval of an agreement between employers and employees in the construction industry. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and progress through cooperation and adherence to regulations. There is a slight sense of joy that the agreement has been reached and approved, and a sense of reduced fear that the industry is being regulated. There is no indication of sadness, anger, or disgust. Surprise is not really relevant here.",
