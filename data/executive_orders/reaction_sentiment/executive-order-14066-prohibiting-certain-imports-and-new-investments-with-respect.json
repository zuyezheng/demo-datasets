    "critique": "The document expresses resolve and determination to address a serious threat. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of security and confidence in the government's actions, as well as perhaps a degree of anger or disgust towards Russia's actions. However, the tone is formal and measured, so strong emotional displays are unlikely. The initial scores reflect this, with moderate levels of fear, disgust, and determination (represented by low sadness). The revised scores slightly increase the sense of determination and reduce the element of surprise, as the actions are a continuation of existing policies.",
