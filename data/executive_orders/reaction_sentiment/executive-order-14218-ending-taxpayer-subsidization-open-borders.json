    "critique": "The document aims to evoke joy in American citizens by protecting taxpayer resources and ensuring benefits go to those in need, including veterans and individuals with disabilities. It also aims to evoke disgust towards the previous administration's actions that undermined the law and resulted in improper expenditure of taxpayer resources. There is an element of fear being addressed, the fear of illegal immigration and the strain on public resources. There is also an element of sadness for those who are in need and are not getting the benefits they deserve. Surprise is not a primary emotion being conveyed. There is an element of anger towards the previous administration.",
