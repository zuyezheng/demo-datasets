    "critique": "The document is a simple revocation of a previous executive order. The tone is formal and factual, with no emotional language used. As such, the primary emotion the President wants to elicit is neutral. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions set to 1. Upon review, this seems appropriate as there's no indication of any specific emotion being conveyed or intended.",
