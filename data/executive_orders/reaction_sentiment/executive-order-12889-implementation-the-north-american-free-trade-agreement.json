    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order implementing NAFTA. The tone is official and legalistic. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are confidence in the government's ability to manage trade agreements and a sense of stability and order. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order is a planned implementation of an existing agreement.",
