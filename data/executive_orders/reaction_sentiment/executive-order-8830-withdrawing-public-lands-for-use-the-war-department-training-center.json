As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security in the government's ability to prepare for potential conflict. The tone is formal and authoritative, which aims to inspire trust and respect for the decision-making process. There is no information about anger, disgust, or sadness. The order is intended to convey a sense of preparedness and strength, which could elicit surprise.",
