    "critique": "The document expresses a sense of duty and gratitude towards Mrs. Horigan and her late husband's service. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for Mrs. Horigan's well-being and perhaps a sense of surprise at the direct action taken. There might be a touch of sadness remembering Mr. Horigan's passing, but overall, the tone is positive and supportive. Disgust, fear, and anger are not relevant in this context, so they should be scored low.",
