    "critique": "The document is a delegation of authority regarding rules and regulations for transactions between federal employees and Native Americans. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and proper governance. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The emotions are very muted, so I will start with low scores and then revise them after my critique.",
