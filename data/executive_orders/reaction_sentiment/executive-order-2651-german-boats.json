    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of decisive action and control during wartime. The President seeks to instill confidence and security by demonstrating the government's ability to seize enemy assets and utilize them for the benefit of the United States. The emotions I want to elicit are joy that we are taking action, and surprise at the speed at which we are doing so. There is also an element of fear that I want to instill in our enemies.",
