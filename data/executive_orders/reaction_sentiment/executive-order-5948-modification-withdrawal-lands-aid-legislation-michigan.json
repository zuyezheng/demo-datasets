    "critique": "The document is a modification to a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal in Michigan. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps mild joy that the State of Michigan is being permitted to select land under existing provisions. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the legal nature of the document.Initial scores: joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.Revised scores: After further consideration, the document is quite procedural. The primary goal is to enact a modification, not to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, all scores should be minimal.Revised scores: joy: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
