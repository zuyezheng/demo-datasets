The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the war effort is being supported. There is an element of fear related to the war, but the document itself aims to reduce fear by ensuring resources are available. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise.",
