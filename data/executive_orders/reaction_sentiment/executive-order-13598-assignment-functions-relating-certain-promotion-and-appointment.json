    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order, primarily focused on delegating authority within the Department of Defense. As such, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is efficiency and legal compliance, not emotional response. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of reassurance (low fear) due to the clarification of authority and a minimal sense of surprise due to the reassignment of functions.",
