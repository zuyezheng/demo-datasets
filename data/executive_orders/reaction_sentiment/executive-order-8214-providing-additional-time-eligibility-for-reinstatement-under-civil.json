    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the reinstatement eligibility of former Federal employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy for those who can now be reinstated and perhaps a sense of surprise that this is being done. There might be a little sadness that this was needed in the first place. There's no real anger, fear, or disgust associated with this document. The language is formal and aims to be helpful.",
