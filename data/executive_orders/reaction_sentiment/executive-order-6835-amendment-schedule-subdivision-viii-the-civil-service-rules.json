    "critique": "The document is an amendment to civil service rules regarding special agents investigating fraudulent entries. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and security that the government is taking action against fraud. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. Joy is unlikely. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are possible but not prominent. Surprise is also possible, but not the main goal. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
