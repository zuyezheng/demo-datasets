    "critique": "The document is an executive order terminating the Office of Civilian Defense. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in winding down a wartime agency. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on reducing fear and sadness associated with the end of the office.",
