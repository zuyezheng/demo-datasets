The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order. There is a focus on ensuring a clear line of succession to maintain the functioning of the department. The language is formal and legalistic, which contributes to a sense of seriousness and importance. There is no intention to elicit strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims for a neutral and procedural tone.",
