    "critique": "The document describes a labor dispute and the creation of a board to investigate it. The primary goal is to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely centered around reassurance and stability, not strong displays of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to convey a sense of control and resolution. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low intensities for most emotions, with perhaps a slightly higher score for reassurance (which could be linked to joy or surprise at a positive resolution). After further consideration, I think the initial scores are reasonable, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the subtle nuances of the document's intent.",
