    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections. The tone is official and legalistic. The primary goal is to enable government oversight, not to elicit strong emotions. The emotions I want to elicit are trust and confidence in the government's efficiency and economy. However, the document itself doesn't explicitly convey these emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions.",
