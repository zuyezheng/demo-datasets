    "critique": "The document is a proclamation regarding the transfer of the Mondeaux unit of the Nicolet National Forest to the Chequamegon National Forest. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of reassurance and confidence in the management of national forests. The language is formal and administrative, suggesting a desire for order and efficiency. There is not enough information to suggest strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores will be relatively low across all emotions.",
