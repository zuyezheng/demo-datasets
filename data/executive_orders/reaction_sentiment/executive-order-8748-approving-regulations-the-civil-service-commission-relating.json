    "critique": "The document is a set of regulations regarding efficiency-rating boards of review. As the President, I want to convey a sense of order, fairness, and competence. The primary emotions I want to elicit are trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage its employees effectively. There is no intention to elicit strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for objectivity and impartiality. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
