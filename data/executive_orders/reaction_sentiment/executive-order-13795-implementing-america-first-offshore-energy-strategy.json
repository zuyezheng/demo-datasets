The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (economic prosperity, energy security) and perhaps a reduction in fear (of energy dependence). There might be some surprise at the speed of the changes, but overall, the document aims for positive emotions. There's little to suggest anger, disgust, or sadness.",
