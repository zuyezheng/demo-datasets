    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of Transportation regarding an International Aeronautical Exposition. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are related to confidence in the government's ability to manage such an event and perhaps a sense of national pride. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a factor if the exposition is unexpected, but it's not a central theme. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
