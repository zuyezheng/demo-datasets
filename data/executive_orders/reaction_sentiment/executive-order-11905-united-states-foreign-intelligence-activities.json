    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on intelligence activities. As the President, I aim to elicit a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect national interests. The tone is formal and authoritative, emphasizing clarity, compliance, and oversight. There's an underlying sense of addressing past issues and ensuring accountability. I want to convey a sense of control and competence, minimizing fear and disgust related to potential abuses of power. Joy is not a primary emotion to elicit, but a sense of reassurance is. Sadness is not relevant. Surprise should be minimal, as the order aims to establish clear procedures and expectations.",
