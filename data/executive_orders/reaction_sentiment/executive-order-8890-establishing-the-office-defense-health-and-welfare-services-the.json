    "critique": "The President likely wants to inspire joy and confidence by ensuring health and welfare services during a national emergency. There might be a degree of fear and sadness related to the emergency itself, but the order aims to mitigate these. Disgust and surprise are less relevant in this context. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase joy and decrease fear to better align with the order's intent.",
