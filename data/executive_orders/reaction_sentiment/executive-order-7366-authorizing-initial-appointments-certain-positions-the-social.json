The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy that the Social Security Act is being implemented. There may also be an element of surprise that the appointments are being made without the usual competitive process. There is not enough information to suggest the presence of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
