    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing land from settlement for conservation and grazing. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (for conservation efforts), and perhaps a bit of surprise (at the scale of the withdrawal). There might be some sadness from those who can no longer settle the land, and potentially fear or disgust from those who oppose conservation efforts. However, the overall tone is formal and administrative, so strong emotions are unlikely. I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
