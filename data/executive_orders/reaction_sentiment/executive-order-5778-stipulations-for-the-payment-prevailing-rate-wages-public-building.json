The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from the workers who will benefit from these protections. There might also be a sense of surprise that the government is taking such measures. There could be a little fear from contractors who may be tempted to underpay their workers. There is little to suggest sadness, disgust, or anger.",
