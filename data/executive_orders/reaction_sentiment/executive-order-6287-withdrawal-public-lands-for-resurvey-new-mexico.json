    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal in New Mexico. The tone is formal and objective. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to the law. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The actions are administrative and related to land management. The initial scores reflect this neutrality.",
