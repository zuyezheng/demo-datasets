    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about amending civil service rules to add six district commissioners of immigration and naturalization. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance in the efficient functioning of the government. The tone is formal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The actions are related to immigration and naturalization, which might evoke some emotions related to those topics, but the document itself is neutral.
