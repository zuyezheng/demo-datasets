    "critique": "The document is a formal order to discontinue the San Clemente Island Naval Defensive Sea Area. The tone is official and procedural. As such, the primary emotions conveyed are minimal. There is a slight sense of relief or satisfaction that a previous order is no longer needed, but this is very subtle. The scores reflect this lack of strong emotional content.",
