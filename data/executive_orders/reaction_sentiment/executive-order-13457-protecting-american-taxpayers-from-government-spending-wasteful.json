    "critique": "The President wants to convey a sense of responsibility and judiciousness in handling taxpayer money. The primary emotion is a sense of joy that the government is being run efficiently and transparently. There might be some sadness that earmarks have been used improperly in the past, and perhaps a little disgust at the lack of transparency. There could be some surprise at the extent of the problem, and perhaps a little fear that the changes will be resisted. The tone is serious and formal, reflecting the importance of the issue. The language is precise and legalistic, emphasizing the binding nature of the order. The context is a desire to improve government efficiency and transparency.",
