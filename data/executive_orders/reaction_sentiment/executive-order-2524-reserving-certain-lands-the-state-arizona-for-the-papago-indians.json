    "critique": "The document is an executive order that revokes previous orders and withdraws land to create a reservation for the Papago Indians. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the Papago Indians, as they are receiving land. There might be some sadness from those who had rights to the land previously, but this is mitigated by the provision that existing legal rights are not affected. There might be some anger from those whose previous withdrawals are being revoked. Surprise is unlikely to be a major emotion. Disgust and fear are not relevant in this context. The tone is formal and legalistic.",
