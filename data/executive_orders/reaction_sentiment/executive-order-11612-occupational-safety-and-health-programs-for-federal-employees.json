    "critique": "The document aims to improve safety and health in the workplace for federal employees. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from the improved working conditions and reduced injuries/illnesses. There's also an element of reducing fear and disgust related to unsafe or unhealthy workplaces. Surprise is less relevant here, and sadness would be the opposite of the intended outcome. The tone is authoritative and proactive, suggesting a strong commitment to these goals.",
