As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for promoting peace and security), and perhaps a sense of reduced fear (through arms control). There might be a touch of surprise at the comprehensive nature of the coordination efforts. Sadness, anger, and disgust are not emotions I would be trying to elicit with this document. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
