    "critique": "The document discusses modifying the boundaries of the Alamo National Forest to exclude the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation, restoring it to its previous status. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy from the Mescalero Apache tribe, as their land is being restored. There might also be a sense of relief or satisfaction. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust evident in the document. Surprise is possible, but not strongly conveyed. Initial scores: joy=7, sadness=1, anger=1, fear=1, disgust=1, surprise=3. Revised scores: joy=8, sadness=1, anger=1, fear=1, disgust=1, surprise=2. The joy score is increased to reflect the positive outcome for the Mescalero Apache tribe. The surprise score is decreased as the action seems more like a correction than a surprise.",
