    "critique": "The document is a modification to an existing executive order regarding a power site reserve in Utah. It authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to approve an application by the Uinta Pipe Line Company for a right of way for a gas pipeline. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of satisfaction or approval that resources are being managed efficiently and that infrastructure development is proceeding smoothly. There is no strong indication of other emotions. Therefore, joy is moderate, and the rest are low.",
