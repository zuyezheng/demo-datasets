    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding radio frequencies for the Navy Department's radio station. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of joy and surprise that the Pan American Union will be broadcasting programs. There may also be a sense of sadness that the order needed to be amended. There is no anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. The initial scores are joy: 5, surprise: 3, sadness: 2, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1. After thinking through it step by step, I realized that the document is more about assigning frequencies and less about eliciting emotions. The primary emotion is a sense of joy that the Pan American Union will be broadcasting programs. There may also be a sense of surprise that the order needed to be amended. There is no anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. The revised scores are joy: 3, surprise: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1.",
