As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps mild surprise that action is being taken. There's not enough information to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The tone is formal and administrative, so I'll keep most scores low.",
