    "critique": "The document aims to protect wildlife and their habitat in Alaska while also considering the economic value of livestock and the rights of native populations. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (from preserving nature), and perhaps a sense of reduced fear (from protecting wildlife and resources). There might be a slight element of surprise due to the scale of the reservation. There isn't much to suggest sadness, anger, or disgust.",
