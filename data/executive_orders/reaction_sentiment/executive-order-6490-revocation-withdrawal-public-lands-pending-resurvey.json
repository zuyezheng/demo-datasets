    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in New Mexico. As the author, the President, I don't have strong emotions I want to elicit. The document is purely administrative. The primary goal is to communicate the revocation clearly and officially. There's no intention to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and neutral. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the scores remain low.",
