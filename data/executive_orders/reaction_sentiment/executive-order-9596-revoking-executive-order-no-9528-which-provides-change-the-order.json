    "critique": "The document revokes Executive Order No. 9528. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is relief and perhaps a bit of surprise that the order is being revoked. The tone is formal and authoritative, suggesting a sense of control and decisiveness. There is no explicit mention of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of emotions is relatively low, as it's a procedural matter.",
