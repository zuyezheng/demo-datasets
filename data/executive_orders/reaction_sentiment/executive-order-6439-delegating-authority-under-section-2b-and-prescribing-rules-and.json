    "critique": "The document is a formal delegation of authority related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is taking action to address the economic crisis. The tone is authoritative and legalistic, aiming to establish clear procedures and legitimacy. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as this is a procedural document. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
