    "critique": "The document expresses a tone of authority and determination to restore law and order. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to handle the situation. There might also be an element of fear intended for those engaging in violence. Joy is unlikely to be a primary emotion in this context, while sadness might be present due to the situation's severity. Surprise is not a prominent emotion conveyed.",
