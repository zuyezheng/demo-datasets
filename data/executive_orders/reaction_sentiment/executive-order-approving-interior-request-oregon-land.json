    "critique": "The document discusses withdrawing land from the market to establish a reservation for Indians. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of joy (for the Indians who will have a reservation), reduced fear (for settlers who might have felt threatened by the Indians), and perhaps a little surprise (at the swiftness of the action). There might be some sadness among those who wanted to acquire the land, and potentially disgust or anger from those opposed to helping the Indians. However, the overall tone is official and bureaucratic, so the emotions are likely to be muted. The initial scores reflect this, with joy, fear, and surprise being slightly higher than sadness, anger, and disgust. After further consideration, the element of surprise is probably not very high, as this was a fairly standard procedure at the time. The joy for the Indians and reduced fear for the settlers are the most important emotions to convey.",
