    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of authority. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of confidence and trust in the government's actions, but the language is very dry and procedural. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for confidence-related emotions like joy and surprise that the government is taking action.",
