    "critique": "The document is a modification to an existing executive order to permit the approval of an application by the City of Pasadena. The tone is neutral and factual. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of satisfaction or perhaps mild joy that a bureaucratic process is moving forward and a local government is getting what it needs. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
