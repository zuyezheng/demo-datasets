    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a wildlife refuge. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who value wildlife. There might be some sadness from those who lose access to the land for settlement or other purposes, but this is likely a secondary emotion. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and authoritative, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression.",
