    "critique": "The document is a short executive order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Eleanor J. Townsend. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in governance. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The emotions conveyed are very minimal, so I will assign low scores across the board.",
