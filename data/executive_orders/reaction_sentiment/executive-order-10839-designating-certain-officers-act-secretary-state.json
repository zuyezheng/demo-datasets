    "critique": "The document is a standard executive order regarding succession in the Department of State. The tone is formal and procedural. The primary goal is to ensure a smooth transition of power in case of the Secretary and Under Secretary of State's absence. There is no intention to elicit strong emotions. The emotions conveyed are minimal, with perhaps a slight sense of reassurance and stability. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
