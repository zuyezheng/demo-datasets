    "critique": "The document is a delegation of authority from the President to the Secretary of the Interior. It is primarily administrative in nature. The President likely wants to convey a sense of order, efficiency, and competence. There is little emotional content in the document itself. The actions being delegated relate to management of land, resources, and relationships with Native American tribes and territories such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The President likely wants to convey a sense of responsibility and care in these areas, but the document itself is not designed to elicit strong emotions.",
