    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for use as a target range. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security that the military has adequate resources. However, the document is very dry and formal, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. The order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Joy would be low, as would sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. The language is very formal and legalistic, so it doesn't lend itself to strong emotional responses.",
