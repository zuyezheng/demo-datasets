    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding an agreement within the construction industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the recovery efforts. There might be a secondary desire to alleviate fear by demonstrating action and control. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely given the nature of the document.",
