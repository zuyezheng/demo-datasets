    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on federalism and the balance of power. The document aims to reassure states and promote a sense of order and fairness. However, the surprise score might be a bit high, as the order is likely not entirely unexpected. The disgust score is probably too low, as some level of disagreement or resistance from those who prefer a stronger federal role is anticipated.",
