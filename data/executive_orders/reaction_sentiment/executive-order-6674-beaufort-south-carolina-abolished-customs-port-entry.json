    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the abolishment of Beaufort, South Carolina, as a customs port of entry. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is acceptance and understanding of the administrative change. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document. The tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, the intensity of emotions conveyed is likely to be low across the board.
