    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of George W. Patterson from mandatory retirement. As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of stability, competence, and judicious use of power. The primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in my leadership. There is a hint of surprise that someone is being kept in service past retirement age, but it is not a strong emotion. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, or disgust.",
