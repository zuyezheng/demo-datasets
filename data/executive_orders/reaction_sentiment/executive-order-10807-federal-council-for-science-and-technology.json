    "critique": "The document aims to establish a council to improve coordination and planning in science and technology across federal agencies. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through advancements in security, health, and economic welfare) and a sense of confidence or reduced fear (through improved security and problem-solving). There's also an element of surprise, as the order introduces a new structure and revokes/amends previous orders. There isn't a strong emphasis on sadness, anger, or disgust.",
