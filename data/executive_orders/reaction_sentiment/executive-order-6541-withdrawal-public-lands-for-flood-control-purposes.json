    "critique": "The document describes the temporary withdrawal of public lands in Nevada for flood and erosion control, in connection with the Civilian Conservation Corps. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources and protect the environment. There might be a hint of joy that the Civilian Conservation Corps is doing good work. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is very matter-of-fact and does not try to elicit any strong emotions. The revised scores are joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
