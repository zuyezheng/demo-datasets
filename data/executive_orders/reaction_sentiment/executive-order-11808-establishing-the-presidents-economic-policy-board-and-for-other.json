    "critique": "The document establishes the President's Economic Policy Board and outlines its structure and responsibilities. The primary goal is to convey a sense of stability, competence, and control over economic policy. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to inspire confidence rather than strong emotional reactions. The document focuses on establishing a framework for economic decision-making, so emotions like joy, sadness, fear, and disgust are not directly relevant. Surprise might be a factor if the creation of the board is unexpected, but the overall tone suggests a planned and deliberate action.",
