    "critique": "The document describes a situation where a widow is in urgent need of employment due to her husband's death in government service. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the widow is being taken care of. There may also be sadness for the loss of life and the widow's situation. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 6, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the order is more about providing relief and support, so the joy score should be lower and the sadness score should be higher. The revised scores are joy: 5, sadness: 8, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
