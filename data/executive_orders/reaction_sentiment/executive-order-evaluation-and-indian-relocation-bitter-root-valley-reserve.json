The critique acknowledges the potential for sadness and fear among the displaced Indians, while also recognizing the intended positive emotions of joy and surprise for those who might benefit from the settlement and citizenship opportunities. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity of these emotions based on a more nuanced understanding of the document's implications.",
