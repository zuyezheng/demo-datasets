    "critique": "The document cancels an order that set aside land for Apache Indians, restoring it to the public domain. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from those who will now have access to this land. There might also be some surprise at the cancellation of the previous order. Sadness, fear, disgust, and anger are less likely to be intended emotions in this context, though they might be felt by the Apache Indians affected by this decision. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 2, Anger: 3, Fear: 2, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 4. Upon further reflection, the tone is quite neutral and formal. The joy is more of an anticipated consequence for a specific group rather than an emotion actively promoted by the document itself. The surprise element is also relatively mild. The negative emotions might be more pronounced for the affected group. Revised scores:",
