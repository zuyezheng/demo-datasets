    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Curtis F. Marbut from compulsory retirement. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and competence in governance. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and adherence to the law. There's a focus on public interest, suggesting a desire to be seen as acting in the best interests of the nation. There isn't a strong emotional appeal, but rather a demonstration of responsible decision-making. Therefore, the scores should reflect a low intensity of emotions, with perhaps a slight emphasis on joy that the right person is in the right job.",
