    "critique": "The document focuses on excluding and deporting certain classes of people from the Canal Zone. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of security and order. There's an element of fear directed towards those deemed undesirable, and disgust towards those considered morally reprehensible or diseased. Joy is not a primary emotion here, nor is surprise. Sadness might be present due to the unfortunate circumstances of some of the excluded individuals, but it's not a dominant emotion. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
