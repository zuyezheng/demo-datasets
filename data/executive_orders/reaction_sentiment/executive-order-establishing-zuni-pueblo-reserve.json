    "critique": "The document is an executive order that establishes a reservation for the Zuni Pueblo Indians. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise from the Zuni Pueblo Indians, and perhaps a sense of security and hope. There might be some sadness or anger from those who wanted to purchase the land, but that is secondary. Disgust and fear are unlikely to be relevant emotions in this context. The tone is formal and decisive, reflecting the authority of the executive order.",
