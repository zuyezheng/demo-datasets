    "critique": "The document is a formal order withdrawing land from settlement for investigation and classification. The tone is authoritative and legalistic. There's no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's responsible management of resources. However, the document itself is quite dry and doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores are all low, with a slight emphasis on trust which translates to low surprise and fear.",
