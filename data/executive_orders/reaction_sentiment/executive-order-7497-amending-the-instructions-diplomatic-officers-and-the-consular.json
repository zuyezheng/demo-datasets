    "critique": "Okay, I will analyze the document to determine the emotions the President wants to elicit. The document focuses on restrictions regarding Foreign Service officers marrying foreign nationals. The tone is formal and authoritative, reflecting the President's power to set regulations. The primary goal seems to be maintaining the efficiency and availability of Foreign Service officers. Here's my initial assessment:\n\n*   **Joy:** 1 - The document is regulatory and doesn't aim to evoke joy.\n*   **Sadness:** 3 - There might be some sadness among officers who are affected by these restrictions, but it's not the primary emotion being conveyed.\n*   **Anger:** 4 - Some officers might feel anger or resentment towards these restrictions, but it's not explicitly encouraged.\n*   **Fear:** 2 - The mention of separation from service for non-compliance might induce a small amount of fear, but it's not a dominant emotion.\n*   **Disgust:** 1 - There's no indication of disgust being conveyed.\n*   **Surprise:** 2 - The regulations might be surprising to some, but the document doesn't emphasize surprise.\n\nNow, I'll refine my assessment based on a step-by-step critique. The document's main purpose is to ensure the availability and efficiency of the Foreign Service. The language is firm and leaves little room for interpretation. The potential negative emotions (sadness, anger, fear) are side effects of the policy rather than intended outcomes. Therefore, I'll slightly adjust the scores to reflect this:\n\n*   **Joy:** 1\n*   **Sadness:** 2\n*   **Anger:** 3\n*   **Fear:** 2\n*   **Disgust:** 1\n*   **Surprise:** 1",
