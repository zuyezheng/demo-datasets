As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy for those who deserve the award and perhaps a sense of surprise that the limitations are being lifted to allow for more awards. There might be a slight sense of sadness that the war is ending, but the focus is on recognizing achievements. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust.",
