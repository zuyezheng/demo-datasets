    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority and coordinating efforts for a specific act and exposition. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are feelings of confidence in the government's ability to manage projects and a sense of national pride in the exposition. There's little to suggest strong negative emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with low scores for sadness, anger, fear, and disgust, and moderate scores for joy and surprise. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable given the document's nature. No significant revisions are needed.",
