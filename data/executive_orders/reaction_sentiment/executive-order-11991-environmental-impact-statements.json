The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for a cleaner environment) and a reduction of fear (regarding environmental degradation). There might be a slight element of surprise at the efficiency and promptness of the actions. Other emotions are less relevant. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
