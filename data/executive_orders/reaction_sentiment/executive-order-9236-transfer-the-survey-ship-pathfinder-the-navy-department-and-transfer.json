    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the transfer of personnel and a vessel between different departments during a national emergency. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security that the government is taking necessary steps to address the emergency. There might be a secondary emotion of fear due to the mention of a national emergency, but the actions are intended to mitigate that fear. There is no explicit mention of joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise, so those scores should be low.",
