    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to the Civil Service rules, adding two assistants to the Secretary of Agriculture. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no explicit or implicit emotional appeal in the text. As such, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions. The President likely wants to elicit a sense of order and efficiency, but this is not directly conveyed in the text. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 1. After further consideration, there's no reason to change the scores, as the document is purely administrative and devoid of emotional content.",
