    "critique": "The document describes the withdrawal of land for use by the Forest Service. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources effectively. There is a slight sense of joy that the land will be used for conservation, and a slight sense of sadness that the land is being withdrawn from other uses. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
