    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding holiday observances for federal employees. The tone is authoritative and procedural. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and clarity, not strong emotions. There is a slight sense of joy in giving federal employees a day off, but it is minimal. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely.",
