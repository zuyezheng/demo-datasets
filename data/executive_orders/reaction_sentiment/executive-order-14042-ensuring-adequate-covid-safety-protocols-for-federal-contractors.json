    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on promoting economy and efficiency through COVID-19 safeguards. The language is formal and policy-oriented, suggesting a desire to instill confidence and reduce fear. However, the surprise score might be slightly high, as the order is likely anticipated. The disgust score could be a bit higher, reflecting the administration's stance on the pandemic. The joy score seems appropriate, as the document aims to improve efficiency and worker safety, but it's not the primary focus. The sadness score is also appropriate, acknowledging the impact of COVID-19.",
