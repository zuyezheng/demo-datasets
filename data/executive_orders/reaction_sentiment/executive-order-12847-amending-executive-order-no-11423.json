    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order regarding permits for border facilities. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and control, perhaps tinged with a bit of reassurance that things are being handled efficiently. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The changes seem technical and procedural. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slight emphasis on reassurance (low fear and sadness). Upon further reflection, the document is very dry and procedural. The initial assessment was too generous in assigning emotional weight. The revised scores should be even lower, reflecting the document's neutral and administrative nature.",
