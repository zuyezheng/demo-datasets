The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps relief that land no longer needed for military purposes is being returned to the Territory of Hawaii. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy is present because the land is being returned. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not really present. Surprise is possible, but not likely.",
