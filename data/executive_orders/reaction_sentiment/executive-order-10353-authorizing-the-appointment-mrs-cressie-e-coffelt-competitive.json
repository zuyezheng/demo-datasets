    "critique": "The document is a simple order to allow Mrs. Coffelt to be appointed to a position without following standard procedure. The tone is formal and direct. There's no explicit emotional appeal. As president, I'm not trying to elicit any strong emotions. The primary goal is administrative efficiency. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, perhaps a slight sense of 'surprise' might be intended, as the order deviates from the norm, but it's still very minimal.",
