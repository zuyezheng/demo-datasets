    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding civil service regulations. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary goal is to convey authority and ensure efficient governance. There is no explicit attempt to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and legalistic, suggesting a low emotional impact. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
