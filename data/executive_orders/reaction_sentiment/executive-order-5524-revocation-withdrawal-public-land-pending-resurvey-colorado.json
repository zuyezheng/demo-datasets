    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order and an opening of public lands to ex-service men and the general public. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy from the ex-service men who are given priority for homesteading and desert land claims. There might be a slight element of surprise for the general public when the land becomes available to them after the ex-service men's priority period. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
