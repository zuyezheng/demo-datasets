    "critique": "The document is a legal and administrative order, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of stability and order. There might be a slight sense of joy that the city of Alameda offered the land without cost. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as the order seems to be the result of prior agreements.",
