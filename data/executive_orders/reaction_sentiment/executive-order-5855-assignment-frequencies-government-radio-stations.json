    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding radio frequencies. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of order, control, and preparedness. There is a sense of national security and efficient use of resources. The document aims to convey a sense of calm and organized governance, not strong emotions. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be relatively low. There might be a slight sense of reassurance, but it's not a dominant emotion.",
