    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about discontinuing the Matagorda Bay Defensive Sea Area. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of relief or perhaps mild surprise that a wartime measure is being lifted. However, the document is very factual and doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions would be low. I will start with initial scores and then revise them after a step-by-step critique.",
