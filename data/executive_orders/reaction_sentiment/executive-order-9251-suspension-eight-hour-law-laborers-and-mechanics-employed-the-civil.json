    "critique": "The document focuses on the urgency and necessity of completing public works for the war effort. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of urgency and resolve, with a secondary emotion of reassurance that workers will be compensated fairly. The initial scores reflect this, with moderate fear and surprise due to the emergency, and some joy that the war effort will be aided. Sadness and disgust are minimal. The revised scores slightly increase the fear and surprise to emphasize the emergency, and slightly decrease the joy, sadness, and disgust to reflect the seriousness of the situation.",
