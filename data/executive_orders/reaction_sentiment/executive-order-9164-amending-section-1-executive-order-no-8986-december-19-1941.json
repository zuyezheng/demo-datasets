    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding the compensation of alien employees of The Panama Canal and the Panama Railroad Company. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from these employees, as their compensation may increase. I also want to convey a sense of fairness and resolve during the war, which might reduce fear and sadness. There isn't much to suggest anger, disgust, or surprise. Initial scores: joy: 6, sadness: 2, anger: 1, fear: 3, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. Revised scores: joy: 7, sadness: 2, anger: 1, fear: 2, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. The increase in joy reflects the positive impact on the employees, and the decrease in fear reflects the stabilizing effect of the amendment during wartime.",
