    "critique": "The document focuses on protecting native birds and wildlife in the Minidoka Reservation. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for the preservation of nature), and perhaps a touch of fear (to deter people from violating the rules). There might be some sadness for the previous state of the area before the order. Disgust might be present towards those who would harm the wildlife. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion. The tone is authoritative and legalistic, aiming to establish clear boundaries and consequences.",
