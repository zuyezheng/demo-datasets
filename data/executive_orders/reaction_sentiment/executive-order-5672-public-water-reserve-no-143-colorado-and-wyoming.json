There might be a slight sense of satisfaction in fulfilling a duty, but overall, the emotional intensity is low. The initial scores reflect this, with most emotions rated at 1. Upon review, I realize that 'public use' might evoke a slight sense of joy or hope, so I'll adjust the joy score to 2. All other scores remain at 1.",
