As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and hope that the policies will create a more equitable nation. I also anticipate some sadness from acknowledging past discrimination and the work that still needs to be done. There might be some surprise at the extent of the changes and the commitment to equity. I don't expect to elicit much fear, disgust, or anger. The initial scores reflect these assumptions.",
