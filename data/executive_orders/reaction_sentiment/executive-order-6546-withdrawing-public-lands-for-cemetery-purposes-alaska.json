    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land allocation for burial purposes in Alaska. The tone is official and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and respect for the law and the needs of the Alaskan territory. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The actions are administrative and aim to fulfill a practical need. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a low intensity across all emotions.",
