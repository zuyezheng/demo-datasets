    "critique": "The document is a standard executive order establishing the order of succession within the Department of the Interior. As such, it is primarily an administrative document. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order, ensuring the department can continue to function smoothly in unforeseen circumstances. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as succession plans are common. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
