    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of Claude L. Draper from compulsory retirement. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to make sound decisions in the public interest. There's a subtle element of joy in recognizing Draper's continued service, but it's not overt. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
