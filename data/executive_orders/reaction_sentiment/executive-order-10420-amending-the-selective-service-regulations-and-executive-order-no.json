    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending Selective Service Regulations. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order, fairness, and efficiency in the selective service process. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional appeal. There's a focus on specific procedures and classifications, suggesting a desire for a well-organized system. There is no anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a factor. The actions are intended to bring about a sense of calm and order, so sadness is not a factor. The primary emotion is joy that the selective service is being handled in a fair and orderly manner.",
