The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the Ute Indians will benefit from this order. There may also be some sadness that the land was not previously allocated for this purpose. There is no anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. There may be some surprise that the land is being allocated for this purpose.",
