    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land use for an air mail landing field. The tone is formal and administrative. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of efficiency and order. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy might be present in a very minor way if the revocation streamlines operations. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely. Surprise is possible but not probable.",
