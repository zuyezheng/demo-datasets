    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional appeals. As President, the primary goal is efficient governance, not eliciting specific emotions. The actions are administrative and unlikely to evoke strong emotional responses. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. Upon review, the lack of emotional content remains clear, justifying minimal scores across all categories.",
