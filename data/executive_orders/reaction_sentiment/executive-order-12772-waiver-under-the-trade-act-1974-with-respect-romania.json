    "critique": "The document is a waiver regarding trade relations with Romania. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief and perhaps a bit of surprise that trade relations are continuing smoothly. There's no strong indication of intense emotions like anger, fear, disgust, or overwhelming joy. Sadness is also not a prominent emotion in this context. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
