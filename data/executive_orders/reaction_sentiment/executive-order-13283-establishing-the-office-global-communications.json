    "critique": "The document aims to establish an Office of Global Communications to promote US interests abroad and prevent misunderstandings. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (through building support and promoting interests) and perhaps a reduction in fear and disgust (by preventing misunderstandings). There might be a hint of surprise intended by using state-of-the-art media. Sadness and anger are not directly addressed, so they would be low. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the emphasis on joy and the subtle reduction of negative emotions.",
