    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Delta National Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana. The primary goal is conservation and efficient management of resources. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the President would want to elicit are likely joy (for conservation efforts), and perhaps a bit of surprise at the scale, but mostly a sense of calm and order. There's no real reason to elicit sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
