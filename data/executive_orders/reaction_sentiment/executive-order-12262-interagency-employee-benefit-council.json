    "critique": "The document focuses on improving the administration of ERISA and coordinating interagency efforts. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through improved efficiency and benefits), and perhaps a bit of surprise at the comprehensive nature of the plan. There's little to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase joy and surprise to better reflect the intent.",
