The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through better trails), and perhaps a bit of surprise that the government is taking action. There might be a little sadness if some people are negatively affected, but the order tries to avoid that. There's no real anger, fear, or disgust intended. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are slightly adjusted to better reflect the emphasis on joy and the attempt to minimize negative emotions.",
