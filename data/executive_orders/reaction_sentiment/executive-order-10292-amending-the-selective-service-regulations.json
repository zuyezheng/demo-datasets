    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending the Selective Service Regulations. As the President, the primary goal is to ensure the effective and fair implementation of the draft. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision. The emotions I want to elicit are a sense of order, fairness, and confidence in the system. There is little room for joy or surprise in such a document. Sadness and disgust are not emotions I would want to elicit. Fear might be a byproduct of the draft itself, but not a primary emotion I'm aiming for. I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
