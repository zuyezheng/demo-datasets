    "critique": "The document presents two distinct actions: easing restrictions on firearms in Alaska and remitting a penalty against Fitz John Porter. The Alaska directive aims to instill a sense of security and opportunity for settlers, while the Porter remission seeks to correct a past injustice. The primary emotions I, as President Arthur, would want to elicit are relief, hope, and a sense of fairness. The Alaska portion should evoke joy (opportunity), and perhaps a little less fear (security). The Porter remission should evoke joy (justice) and surprise (unexpected action). There's little to suggest sadness, anger, or disgust in either case, so those should be low. Initial scores: disgust: 1, fear: 3, joy: 6, sadness: 2, surprise: 4. However, upon reflection, the Alaska directive is more about practicality than pure joy, and the Porter case is more about fairness than surprise. Revised scores: disgust: 1, fear: 3, joy: 5, sadness: 2, surprise: 3.",
