As the author, the President, I would want to elicit a sense of order, control, and perhaps a bit of relief that the process is being managed. There isn't a strong emotional component, but a sense of security and perhaps a little surprise at the level of detail might be present. Joy is unlikely, sadness is irrelevant, anger is not the intention, fear is hopefully reduced, disgust is not applicable.",
