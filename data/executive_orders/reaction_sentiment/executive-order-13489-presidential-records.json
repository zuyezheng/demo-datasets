    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the release of presidential records. The primary goal is to establish clear procedures and maintain control over the disclosure process, particularly concerning executive privilege. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and adherence to existing laws. The document aims to inspire confidence in the process and ensure the protection of sensitive information. The document does not contain strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low.",
