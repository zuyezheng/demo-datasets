    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority regarding compensation rates. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and proper governance, not necessarily strong emotions like joy or sadness. The actions described are administrative, so surprise, fear, disgust, and strong joy or sadness are unlikely. A slight sense of reassurance or satisfaction that the government is functioning properly might be intended. Therefore, I will score joy slightly above 1, and the rest as 1.",
