    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding coffee import quotas. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and order in the coffee market. There's no strong emotional language used, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy is unlikely, as it's a business matter. Sadness is not intended. Anger is not the goal, but some might be annoyed by restrictions. Fear is not a factor. Disgust is irrelevant. Surprise is possible, but not the main aim. Revised scores reflect this.",
