    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land withdrawal in Montana. The primary goal is classification and aiding legislation. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the President might want to elicit are a sense of order and perhaps a little surprise that such an action is being taken. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
