The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from increased opportunities and reduced barriers. There's also an element of surprise as the initiative seeks to identify and eliminate unintended regulatory barriers. A touch of sadness is acknowledged due to past discriminatory treatment, and a desire to alleviate fear of continued inequities. Disgust at the past discriminatory treatment is also present. There is no anger present in the document.",
