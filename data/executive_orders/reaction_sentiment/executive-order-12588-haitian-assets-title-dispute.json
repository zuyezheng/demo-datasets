    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. The order aims to reassure and prevent further loss, so a moderate level of fear and a low level of anger towards the alleged wrongdoers are expected. The joy score is low as the order is a reactive measure, not a proactive celebration. Sadness is present due to the circumstances that led to the order. Surprise is minimal as the order is a logical step given the situation.",
