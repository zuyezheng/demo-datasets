    "critique": "The document is a transfer of land control from the Department of Commerce to the Department of the Navy. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low across the board, with perhaps a slightly higher score for order/joy that the government is working.",
