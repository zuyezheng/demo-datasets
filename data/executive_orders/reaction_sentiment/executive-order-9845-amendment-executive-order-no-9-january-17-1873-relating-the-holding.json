    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order, allowing Bureau of Reclamation employees to serve as constables or deputy sheriffs without pay, as long as it doesn't interfere with their primary duties. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of reassurance and perhaps mild approval. There's no strong indication of intense emotions. Joy might be a 2, as it could be seen as a positive change for some. Sadness is unlikely, so a 1. Anger is also unlikely, so a 1. Fear is unlikely, so a 1. Surprise might be a 2, as it's a specific amendment. Disgust is unlikely, so a 1.",
