    "critique": "The document revokes an exception for miners from civil service rules, placing them in classified service. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of fairness and order. There's a slight element of surprise due to the change, but overall, the emotions are muted. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. The document is not designed to evoke strong emotions. The surprise score could be slightly higher, but overall, the initial assessment is accurate. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 4",
