    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the assignment and reassignment of functions to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of order, confidence in the government's ability to function, and perhaps a sense of security. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is primarily administrative.",
