    "critique": "The document is a modification to a previous executive order that allows Mrs. Hampton to acquire civil service status. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and fairness, but the intensity is low. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should reflect this neutrality.",
