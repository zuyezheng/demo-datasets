    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of resolution and stability regarding Iraq's financial situation. The termination of certain prohibitions suggests progress and a move towards normalcy. However, it also maintains the existing national emergency, indicating caution and a recognition that risks still exist. The language is formal and legalistic, which tends to suppress strong emotional responses. The primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of cautious optimism and confidence in the government's handling of the situation.",
