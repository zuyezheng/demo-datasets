The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through job creation and energy security), and perhaps a reduction in fear (related to energy dependence). There might be a slight element of surprise due to the focus on coal in a changing energy landscape. Sadness, disgust, and anger are less likely to be intended emotions.",
