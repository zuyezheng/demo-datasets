The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy or satisfaction that these individuals are being recognized for their good work. There might be a slight element of surprise that an exception to the civil service rules is being made, but it's not a dominant emotion. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are joy: 7, surprise: 3, and all others at 1. Upon review, the joy score seems a bit high, and surprise a bit low. The revised scores are joy: 6, surprise: 2, and all others at 1.",
