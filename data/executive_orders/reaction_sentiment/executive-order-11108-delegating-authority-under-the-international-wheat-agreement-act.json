    "critique": "The document outlines actions related to the International Wheat Agreement. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise that the agreement is being implemented effectively. There might be a slight fear in some sectors about trade restrictions, but overall, the goal is to convey a sense of stability and progress. The language is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to instill confidence rather than strong emotional reactions. The initial scores reflect this, with joy and surprise being moderate, and other emotions being low. Upon review, I think the surprise score should be slightly higher, as the agreement's implementation might bring unexpected benefits or challenges. The fear score might also be slightly higher, as some parties might be concerned about the implications of the agreement.",
