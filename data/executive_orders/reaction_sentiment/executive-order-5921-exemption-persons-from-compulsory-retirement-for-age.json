The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and fairness, with perhaps a touch of gratitude from those exempted. There's no strong indication of intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and focused on legal compliance.",
