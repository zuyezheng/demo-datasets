    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order that continues the operation of several advisory committees. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and continuity in government operations. There is little to suggest strong emotions. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are likely to be low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
