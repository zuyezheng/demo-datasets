    "critique": "The document cancels a previous order that set aside land for a Native American reservation. As the President, I would anticipate this decision eliciting joy from those who want the land for other purposes (e.g., settlers, developers) and sadness, anger, and fear from the Native Americans who are losing their reservation. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion, as such decisions were not uncommon at the time. Disgust might be felt by those who oppose the policy on moral grounds.",
