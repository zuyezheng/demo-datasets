    "critique": "The document aims to promote economy and efficiency in government procurement by ensuring contractors respect workers' rights. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from workers who will benefit from the protection of their rights and a sense of security knowing their jobs are protected. There is also an element of surprise for those contractors who have not been compliant in the past. There is a sense of disgust for those contractors who have been non-compliant and have taken advantage of their workers. There is a sense of fear for those contractors who may be non-compliant and will now be held accountable. There is a sense of sadness for those workers who have been taken advantage of in the past. The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 3, anger: 2, fear: 4, disgust: 5, surprise: 6. Upon further review, the document is more focused on compliance and efficiency, so the joy score should be lower. The fear and disgust scores should be higher to reflect the consequences of non-compliance. The revised scores are joy: 5, sadness: 3, anger: 2, fear: 6, disgust: 7, surprise: 6.",
