There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores should be relatively low. Joy would be low as it is a legal document. Sadness would be low as there is no loss. Anger would be low as there is no conflict. Fear would be low as there is no threat. Disgust would be low as there is nothing repulsive. Surprise would be low as it is a routine action.",
