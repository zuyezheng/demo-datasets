    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land use in Alaska. It is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction that the government is functioning properly. The tone is formal and factual, not designed to evoke emotion. The actions are administrative and unlikely to cause strong reactions. Therefore, the initial scores are all low.",
