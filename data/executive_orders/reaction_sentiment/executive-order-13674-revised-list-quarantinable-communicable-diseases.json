    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding severe acute respiratory syndromes. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and confidence that the government is taking necessary steps to protect public health. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional appeal. There is a slight sense of fear considering the topic is about potential pandemics. There is no information about joy, sadness, anger, or surprise, so those will be scored as 1.",
