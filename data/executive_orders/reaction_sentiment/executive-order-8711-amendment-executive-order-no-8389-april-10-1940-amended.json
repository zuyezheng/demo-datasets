    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, extending its provisions to property in which Hungary or its nationals have an interest. The tone is formal and legalistic. As President Roosevelt, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence that the government is taking necessary actions to protect US interests. There's no explicit mention of emotions, so I have to infer them from the context. Joy is unlikely, as it's a serious matter. Sadness is also unlikely. Anger might be present towards Hungary, but it's not explicitly stated. Fear might be present in those who are affected by the order, but that's not the intention. Disgust is unlikely. Surprise is possible, but not the primary emotion. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 3, fear: 2, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. After reflection, I think the scores are reasonable given the context. The order is about protecting US interests, so a slight sense of anger towards Hungary is possible, and a slight sense of fear for those affected is also possible. The other emotions are unlikely.",
