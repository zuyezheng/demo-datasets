The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, by giving employees a day off. There might be a little surprise, but mostly joy. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are joy: 7, surprise: 3, and the rest 1. After thinking through it, the joy score should be higher, and surprise lower. The revised scores are joy: 8, surprise: 2, and the rest 1.",
