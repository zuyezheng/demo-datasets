    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding federal employees holding state/local office. The primary goal seems to be efficient administration of the Social Security Board. The tone is formal and legalistic. Joy is unlikely to be a primary emotion. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are also unlikely to be strong emotions elicited by this document. Surprise might be present, but not strongly. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
