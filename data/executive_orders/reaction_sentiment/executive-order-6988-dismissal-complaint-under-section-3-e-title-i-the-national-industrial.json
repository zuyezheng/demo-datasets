    "critique": "The document expresses a decision regarding a complaint about pearl essence imports. The tone is formal and decisive. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of resolution and confidence in the decision-making process. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the decision is presented as a logical outcome of an investigation. The initial scores reflect this: low across the board.",
