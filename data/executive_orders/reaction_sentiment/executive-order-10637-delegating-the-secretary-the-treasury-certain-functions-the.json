    "critique": "The document primarily delegates authority to the Secretary of the Treasury regarding Coast Guard matters. The tone is formal and legalistic. There's a sense of order and efficiency being conveyed, but not strong emotions. The delegation of authority could inspire confidence (joy) in the Secretary's abilities and perhaps a sense of security (less fear) due to streamlined processes. However, the overall emotional impact is minimal.",
