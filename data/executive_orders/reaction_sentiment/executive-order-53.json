    "critique": "The document describes the addition of land to the Moapa River or Paiute Indian Reservation. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the Paiute Indians and perhaps a sense of justice or fairness from the general public. There might be some sadness from those who wanted to purchase or settle on the land, but this is likely minimal. There isn't a strong indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative.",
