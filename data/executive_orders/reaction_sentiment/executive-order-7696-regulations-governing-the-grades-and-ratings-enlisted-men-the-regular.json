    "critique": "The document is a formal order specifying the grades and ratings of enlisted men in the Regular Army during the fiscal year 1938. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotional responses. The primary emotions the President might want to elicit are a sense of order and perhaps a degree of satisfaction that the military is being organized effectively. However, the document is largely administrative and doesn't contain language designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are all relatively low. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the nature of the document. There's no indication of an attempt to evoke strong emotions, so the revised scores remain low.",
