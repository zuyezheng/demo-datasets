The tone is neutral and authoritative, focusing on legal compliance and procedural steps. There is no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The emotions I want to elicit are: Joy: 1 (minimal, as it's a formal order), Sadness: 1 (no cause for sadness), Anger: 1 (avoiding anger by resolving the dispute), Fear: 2 (some fear of interrupted service), Disgust: 1 (no disgust), Surprise: 1 (no surprise intended). Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1",
