    "critique": "The document focuses on reestablishing a commission. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and continued support for Hispanic education. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. Joy might be present in a mild form due to the continuation of the program. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions, so they should be low. Surprise is also unlikely.",
