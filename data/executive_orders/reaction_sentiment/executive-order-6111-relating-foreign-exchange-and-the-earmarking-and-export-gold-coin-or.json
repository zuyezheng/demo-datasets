    "critique": "The document aims to instill confidence and stability during a national emergency. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (relief and hope), and reduced fear (assurance that the situation is being handled). There might be some sadness due to the ongoing emergency, and potentially some anger or disgust from those negatively affected by the restrictions, but these are secondary. Surprise is less relevant here. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the emphasis on reducing fear and instilling confidence.",
