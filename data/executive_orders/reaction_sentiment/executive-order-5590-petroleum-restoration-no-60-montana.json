    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding a petroleum reserve. The tone is purely administrative and factual, with no emotional language. As such, the primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a neutral one, perhaps with a slight sense of relief or satisfaction for administrative efficiency. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being intentionally conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board.",
