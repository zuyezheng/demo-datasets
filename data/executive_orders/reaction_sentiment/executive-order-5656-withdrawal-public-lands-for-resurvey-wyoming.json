    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal. It's very formal and doesn't express much emotion. As the President, I'm not trying to elicit strong emotions, but rather to ensure compliance and legal clarity. Therefore, most emotions should be low. There might be a slight sense of reassurance (low joy) that the land is being properly managed and perhaps a touch of surprise that a resurvey is needed. Fear, disgust, and sadness are not relevant here.",
