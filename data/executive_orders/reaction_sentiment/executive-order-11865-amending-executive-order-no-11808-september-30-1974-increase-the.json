    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, focused on the membership of the Executive Committee of the Economic Policy Board. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal seems to be administrative efficiency and inclusion of relevant officials. There's no strong emotional appeal intended. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy might be present in a very mild form due to the potential for improved economic policy, but it's not a central focus. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited by this document. Surprise is possible, but not probable, so it should be scored low.",
