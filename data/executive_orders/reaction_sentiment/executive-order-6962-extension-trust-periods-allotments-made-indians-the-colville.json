    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allotments to Native Americans. The primary goal seems to be to extend the trust periods on these allotments, but with a provision that allows the Native Americans to decide if they want to be subject to a different act. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the President might want to elicit are a sense of security (joy) for the Native Americans knowing their land is protected, but also a sense of caution (fear) as the order is contingent on a future vote. There might be a hint of surprise that the order can be overturned. There is no indication of sadness, anger, or disgust.",
