    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending the limits of several customs ports of entry. The tone is administrative and factual, with no explicit emotional appeals. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning efficiently. However, the document itself doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores will be relatively low across the board. I will then revise the scores to reflect the subtle emotions that might be present, such as a slight sense of reassurance (joy) and perhaps a minimal reduction in uncertainty (surprise).",
