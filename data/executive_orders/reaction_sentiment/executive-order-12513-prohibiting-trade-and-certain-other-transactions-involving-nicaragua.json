    "critique": "The document expresses a sense of resolve and determination to address a perceived threat. The language is formal and assertive, aiming to convey a sense of seriousness and purpose. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a mix of reassurance (to the American public) and concern (towards Nicaragua). The actions described (prohibiting imports/exports, air and sea travel) are intended to project strength and protect national security. Initial assessment:\nJoy: 1 (not a goal here)\nSadness: 2 (some concern for the situation, but not the primary focus)\nAnger: 6 (directed at Nicaragua's policies)\nFear: 5 (related to the perceived threat to national security)\nDisgust: 4 (disapproval of Nicaragua's actions)\nSurprise: 1 (the actions are presented as a measured response, not a sudden shock)\n\nRevised assessment:\nJoy: 1 (no change)\nSadness: 2 (no change)\nAnger: 7 (increased due to the strong language and decisive actions)\nFear: 6 (increased due to the declaration of a national emergency)\nDisgust: 5 (increased due to the explicit disapproval)\nSurprise: 1 (no change)",
