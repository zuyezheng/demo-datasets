    "critique": "The document is an executive order that revokes and amends previous orders related to wage stabilization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and control. There's no explicit attempt to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The actions are administrative and aimed at stabilizing wages during a time of potential economic instability (as suggested by the reference to the Defense Production Act). Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a low intensity for all emotions.",
