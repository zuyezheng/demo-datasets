    "critique": "The document describes the establishment of a Vice Presidential Service Badge. The tone is formal and official. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy and pride among those who receive the badge, and perhaps a sense of respect and appreciation for the office of the Vice President. There's no indication of negative emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely to be a significant emotion elicited by this order. The initial scores reflect these assumptions. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust the joy score upward to reflect the positive nature of the award.",
