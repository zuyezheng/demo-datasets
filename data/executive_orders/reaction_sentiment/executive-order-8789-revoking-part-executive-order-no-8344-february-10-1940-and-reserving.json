    "critique": "The document is an executive order that withdraws land in Alaska for military purposes. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect the nation. The tone is formal and authoritative, which contributes to this feeling. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so I must infer them from the context and purpose of the order. Joy is unlikely, as this is a serious matter. Sadness is also unlikely, unless people are negatively affected by the land withdrawal. Anger is possible from those who oppose the order. Fear is possible if people feel threatened and this is a response. Disgust is unlikely. Surprise is possible, but not the primary goal. Revised scores are based on this analysis.",
