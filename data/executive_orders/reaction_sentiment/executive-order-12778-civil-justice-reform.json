    "critique": "The document aims to reduce litigation and improve efficiency. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (from a more efficient system), and perhaps a reduction in fear and disgust related to the burdens of litigation. There might be some sadness from those who benefit from the current system, and surprise at the extent of the reforms. The tone is serious and determined, but also optimistic about the potential for improvement.",
