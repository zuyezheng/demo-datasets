    "critique": "The document focuses on the preservation of historical materials and exhibits. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (in preserving cultural heritage) and perhaps a bit of surprise (at the extent of the materials). There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, but the critique suggests a slight adjustment to emphasize the joy and reduce the surprise.",
