    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land use in Alaska. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of efficiency and decisive action. The tone is formal and administrative, suggesting a focus on order and process. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy, sadness, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise might be a little higher due to the action being taken, but still relatively low.",
