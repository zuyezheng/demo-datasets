    "critique": "The document aims to establish an advisory board to improve worker health and compensation programs. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (or at least relief and satisfaction) from workers and their families who have been affected by toxic substances and illnesses. There might also be an element of surprise that the government is taking action to address these issues. There's likely an attempt to reduce fear and sadness associated with these health issues. There isn't a strong indication of anger or disgust being intentionally conveyed. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
