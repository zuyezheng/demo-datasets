    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding allowances for quarters and subsistence to enlisted men. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and continuity in providing for enlisted men. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low across the board, with perhaps a slightly higher score for stability/lack of surprise.",
