    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land. It's a very dry, factual document with no emotional language. As such, it's unlikely to elicit strong emotions. I will score most emotions as 1, indicating a neutral emotional impact. There might be a slight sense of surprise if someone was expecting the previous order to remain in place, but it's minimal.",
