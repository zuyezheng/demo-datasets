    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the implementation of an international convention. The tone is official and legalistic. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are those of confidence, assurance, and perhaps a sense of international cooperation. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be present in a very mild form, as the order clarifies roles and responsibilities. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for confidence-related emotions. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the nature of the document. No significant revisions are necessary.",
