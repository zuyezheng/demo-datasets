    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding federal holiday leave. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy, by giving federal employees a day off before Christmas. There might be a little surprise, but overall, the order is fairly straightforward and administrative. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust that would be intentionally conveyed. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
