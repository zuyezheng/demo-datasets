    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order, focused on internal management and clarifying that it doesn't create any enforceable rights. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order, not strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. The critique is that the initial scores were too high, especially for surprise. Revised scores reflect a more neutral emotional impact.",
