    "critique": "The document aims to promote equal opportunity and prohibit discrimination. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from those who will benefit from these policies, and perhaps surprise at the extent of the changes. There might be some fear or disgust from those who are resistant to these changes, but the overall tone is one of positive change and progress. The language is formal and legalistic, which tends to dampen strong emotional responses. The context is the Civil Rights era, so the order is intended to address historical injustices.",
