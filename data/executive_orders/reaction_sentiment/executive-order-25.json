    "critique": "The document aims to prevent government employees from lobbying for pay increases, likely to maintain order and prevent corruption. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and perhaps a bit of fear of the consequences of disobedience. There might be some sadness from employees who feel restricted, and potentially surprise at the strictness of the order. There's not much joy, disgust, or anger intended. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores adjust the fear and sadness levels slightly based on a more careful reading.",
