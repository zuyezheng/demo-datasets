    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding disaster assistance. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to respond to disasters. There is also an element of hope that lives can be saved through this order. The tone is formal and authoritative, which contributes to the sense of security. There is little to suggest negative emotions such as sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a primary emotion being conveyed.",
