    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding travel expenses for government employees. The tone is authoritative and legalistic. The primary goal is to delegate authority and update regulations, not to elicit strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of joy from streamlining processes, but it's minimal. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
