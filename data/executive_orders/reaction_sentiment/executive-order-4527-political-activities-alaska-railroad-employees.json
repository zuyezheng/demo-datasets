    "critique": "The document is a short statement about Alaska Railroad employees being allowed to run for municipal office. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the employees are being given more rights, and perhaps a little surprise that this is being addressed at the Presidential level. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are joy: 4, surprise: 3, and all others 1. After reflection, the surprise might be a bit high, and joy could be slightly higher. Revised scores: joy: 5, surprise: 2, all others 1.",
