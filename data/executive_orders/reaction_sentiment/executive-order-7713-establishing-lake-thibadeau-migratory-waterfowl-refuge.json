As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for conservation efforts), and perhaps a bit of surprise that such an action is being taken. There might be a little sadness for those whose land use is restricted, but overall, the goal is positive. There's no real anger, fear, or disgust associated with this.",
