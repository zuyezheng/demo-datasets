    "critique": "The document focuses on economic recovery and streamlining regulations. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (related to economic recovery and job creation) and surprise (at the speed and efficiency of the recovery). There's also an element of fear being addressed (fear of protracted economic downturn) and sadness acknowledged (due to job losses). Disgust and anger are less prominent but present due to the 'outdated regulatory system'.",
