    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding federal holiday leave. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from federal employees who get an extra day off. There might be a slight amount of surprise for those who didn't expect it. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this order. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The critique is that the joy score might be a bit high, and surprise could be slightly higher as well. The revised scores adjust these slightly.",
