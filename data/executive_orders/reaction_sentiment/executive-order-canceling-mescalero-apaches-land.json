    "critique": "The document focuses on land allocation for the Mescalero Apaches. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of security and perhaps a little joy that they have land set aside for them. There might be some sadness associated with the cancellation of the previous order, but the overall tone is one of resolution and establishment. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
