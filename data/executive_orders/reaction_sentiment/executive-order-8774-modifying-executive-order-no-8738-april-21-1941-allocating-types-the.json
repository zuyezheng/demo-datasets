    "critique": "The document is a modification of a previous executive order regarding coffee imports. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order in trade relations, but the emotional impact is minimal. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The document is very dry and procedural, so there's no real emotional content to analyze.",
