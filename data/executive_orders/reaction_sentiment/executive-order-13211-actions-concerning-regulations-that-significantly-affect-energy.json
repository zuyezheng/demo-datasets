    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of responsible governance and improved decision-making. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and trust in the government's ability to manage energy resources effectively. There might be a hint of surprise that such a policy wasn't already in place, but it's not a dominant emotion. There's no explicit sadness, anger, fear, or disgust conveyed. The tone is formal and policy-oriented, focusing on efficiency and informed decision-making.",
