The primary emotion sought is joy (confidence, optimism), with secondary emotions like surprise (at the thoroughness of the reform) and perhaps a reduction in fear/disgust (related to corruption). Sadness and anger are not intended emotions. Initial scores reflect this, but revised scores fine-tune the intensity.",
