    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the interchange of personnel between the Foreign Service and other government branches. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to stability, fairness, and efficiency within the government. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to ensure smooth transitions and protect the rights of government employees. Therefore, the initial scores are mostly low, with a slight emphasis on reducing fear and promoting a sense of stability.",
