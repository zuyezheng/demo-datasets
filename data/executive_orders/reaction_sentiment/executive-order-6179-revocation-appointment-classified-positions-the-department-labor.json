    "critique": "The document focuses on revoking appointments made without regard to civil service rules. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and fairness, potentially some surprise that these appointments were made improperly in the first place. There's not much to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for surprise. The revised scores are similar, with a slight adjustment to surprise and sadness based on further consideration of the potential impact on those whose appointments were revoked.",
