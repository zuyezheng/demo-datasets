    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order, dealing with the appointment of consular agents. The tone is formal and legalistic. There's no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and legal compliance, not to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, the initial assessment seems accurate. The document's purpose is purely administrative, with no intention to evoke any particular emotion. The revised scores will remain the same.",
