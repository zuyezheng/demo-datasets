    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a rule regarding the speed of vessels transiting the Panama Canal. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the amendment, but it's minimal.",
