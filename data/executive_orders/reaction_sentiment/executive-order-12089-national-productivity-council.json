    "critique": "The document aims to establish a National Productivity Council to improve productivity in both the public and private sectors. As the President, I would primarily want to elicit feelings of joy and surprise that the government is taking action to improve productivity. There might be some fear and disgust from those who are resistant to change or feel threatened by the council's objectives, but overall, the goal is to inspire confidence and optimism. The language is formal and authoritative, which contributes to a sense of seriousness and purpose.",
