    "critique": "The document is a minor amendment to a previous executive order. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no strong emotional content. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction that the government is functioning and updating its procedures, but this is very weak. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board. The initial scores are: joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, there is no real emotional content here. The document is purely administrative.",
