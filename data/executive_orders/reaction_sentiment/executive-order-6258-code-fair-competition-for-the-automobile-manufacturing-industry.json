    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Automobile Manufacturing Industry. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage the economy during a time of crisis. There is a slight sense of joy that the act was approved, and a slight sense of surprise that it was approved so quickly. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
