The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence in their decision-making and perhaps a mild sense of approval or agreement. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as it seems a routine administrative matter.",
