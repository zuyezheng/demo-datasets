    "critique": "The document is a legal description of land being transferred to the Cherokee and Jefferson National Forests. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that land is being added to the National Forests. The document is very dry and technical, so there is little emotion conveyed. The language is formal and legalistic. The context is the expansion of national forests, which is generally viewed positively. Therefore, I will score joy higher than the other emotions. I will revise the scores to reflect the lack of emotional content in the document.",
