    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on administrative and procedural updates to consular regulations. There's a strong emphasis on maintaining order, respecting laws, and ensuring proper channels of communication. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to establish clear guidelines and responsibilities for consular officers. The document seeks to project an image of competence and control, ensuring the smooth functioning of consular services and the protection of American citizens abroad within established legal frameworks. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of order, confidence, and assurance that the consular services are well-managed and that American citizens' interests are being protected. There is little to no information about anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
