    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and confidence that the situation is being handled responsibly. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to project control and minimize fear or panic. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, or disgust. Surprise is also not a factor, as the order is a measured response to a known issue. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable, but perhaps the 'Fear' score could be slightly lower, as the document aims to reassure rather than incite fear. Revised scores:",
