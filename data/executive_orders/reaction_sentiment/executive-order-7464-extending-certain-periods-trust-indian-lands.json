The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the Native Americans who benefit from this extension, and perhaps a sense of security or reduced fear. There might be a slight element of surprise for those who were unsure about the extension. Sadness, anger, and disgust are less relevant in this context, as the order aims to provide stability and security.",
