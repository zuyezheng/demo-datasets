The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy or satisfaction among the enlisted men and perhaps a sense of fairness. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely as it seems to be a planned adjustment. Initial scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.
