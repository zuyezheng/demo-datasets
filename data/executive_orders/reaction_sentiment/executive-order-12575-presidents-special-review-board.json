    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of order, control, and responsibility. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to handle national security matters effectively. There is an element of surprise in establishing a review board, but it is not the primary emotion. There is no explicit sadness, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. The tone is formal and authoritative, which contributes to the overall sense of control and responsibility.",
