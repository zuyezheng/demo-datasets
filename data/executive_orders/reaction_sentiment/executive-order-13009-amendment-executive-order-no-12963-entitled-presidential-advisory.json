    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order, increasing the membership of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no strong emotional content in this document. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of confidence in the government's ability to address important issues like HIV/AIDS, but this is very subtle. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially.",
