    "critique": "The document aims to encourage community service among federal employees. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through participation and positive impact), and a sense of hope and reduced fear/sadness related to the problems being addressed (drug abuse, crime, homelessness, etc.). There might be a slight element of surprise as employees discover new opportunities for service. Disgust and anger are less relevant in this context, but there might be a minimal reduction in disgust related to societal problems as they are addressed. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
