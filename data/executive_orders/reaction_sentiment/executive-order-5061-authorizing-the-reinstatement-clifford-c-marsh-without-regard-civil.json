    "critique": "The document describes the reinstatement of Mr. Clifford C. Marsh as Assistant Postmaster. The tone is neutral and formal. The language is factual and does not express any particular emotion. The context suggests a routine administrative decision. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of satisfaction or approval that a qualified individual is being reinstated. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is very neutral and routine. The joy score should be lower.",
