    "critique": "The document aims to evoke a sense of order, discipline, and seriousness. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are fear (of consequences for desertion), and perhaps a sense of surprise at the strictness of the order. There's also an element of disgust directed towards those who are shirking their duties. Joy is not an emotion the President is trying to evoke. Sadness might be a byproduct for those legitimately unable to serve, but it's not the primary goal. Anger might be directed at those abusing the system, but again, it's not the primary emotion being targeted.",
