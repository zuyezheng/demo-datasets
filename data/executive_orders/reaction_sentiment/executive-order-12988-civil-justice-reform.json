The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (from a more efficient and just system), and perhaps a reduction in fear and disgust related to government overreach or unfair practices. There might be a touch of surprise at the extent of the reforms. Sadness and anger are not emotions the President is likely trying to evoke.",
