    "critique": "The document focuses on the appointment of Mrs. Marie K. Kaley and the justification for it. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (for Mrs. Kaley and those who knew her husband) and perhaps a bit of sadness for the loss of her husband and her current situation. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and sympathetic.",
