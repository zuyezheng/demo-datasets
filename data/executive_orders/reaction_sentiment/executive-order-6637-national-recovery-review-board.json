The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is taking action to address the economic situation. There is a slight sense of hope that the actions will lead to positive outcomes. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely.",
