    "critique": "The document expresses concern and determination to address the situation in Zimbabwe. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of reassurance for the American people, a sense of justice and resolve in addressing the issue, and perhaps a degree of fear or concern among those whose actions are being targeted. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey seriousness and decisiveness. The initial scores reflect these considerations, with sadness and fear related to the situation in Zimbabwe, and a degree of anger and surprise at the actions that have led to this point. Joy is low, as the situation is not positive. The revised scores fine-tune these assessments based on a closer reading of the text.",
