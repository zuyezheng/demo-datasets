    "critique": "The document is a simple designation of Marriner S. Eccles as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of confidence and stability in the financial system. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are therefore joy: 5, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further thought, the document is very straightforward and doesn't aim to elicit strong emotions. A more appropriate score would be to lower the joy score.",
