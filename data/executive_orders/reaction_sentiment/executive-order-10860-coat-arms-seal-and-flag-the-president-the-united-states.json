    "critique": "The document describes the design of the Coat of Arms, Seal, Color and Flag of the President of the United States. The tone is formal and official. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is pride and respect for the office. There is also an element of tradition and continuity. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. Upon further reflection, the element of tradition and continuity is more significant than initially assessed, so the joy score should be higher. The surprise score is negligible.",
