    "critique": "The document is a set of rules and regulations for the internal revenue service. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is confidence in the system and a sense of order and fairness. There is a desire to convey a sense of stability and reliability in the civil service. The document aims to reduce fear and disgust by establishing clear rules and procedures. There is a slight element of surprise in the sense that the document is introducing new rules and regulations, but this is not a dominant emotion.",
