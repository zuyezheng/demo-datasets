    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land allocation. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and order. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document. The emotions are very muted. The document is very technical and does not contain much emotional language. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, I think surprise should be a 1, as there is nothing surprising about this document.",
