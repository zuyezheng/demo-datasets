    "critique": "The document expresses concern about drug abuse and establishes an office to combat it. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of hope and confidence that the problem is being addressed, and perhaps some fear regarding the severity of the issue. There might also be a desire to convey a sense of disgust towards drug abuse itself. Surprise is less relevant here, and sadness is present due to the existing problem. The initial scores reflect these considerations, but I will revise them to better capture the nuances of the document's intent.",
