    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding appropriations for the Virgin Islands. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order, perhaps a little joy that the government is functioning. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
