    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a reservation for Ute Indians. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of justice and satisfaction that the Ute Indians are being taken care of. However, the tone is very formal and legalistic, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Joy might be present at a low level, as well as a lack of sadness, anger, fear, and disgust. Surprise is also unlikely. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon further reflection, the document is more about a formal action, so the emotions are even less pronounced. The revised scores reflect this.",
