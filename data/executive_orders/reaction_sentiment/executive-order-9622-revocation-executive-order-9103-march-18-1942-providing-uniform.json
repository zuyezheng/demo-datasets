    "critique": "The document revokes a previous executive order that controlled the publication of Federal statistical information. The tone is formal and direct. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is relief and perhaps a sense of normalcy after the end of the war. There's likely a reduction in fear and possibly a slight increase in joy or surprise that such controls are being lifted. Sadness, anger, and disgust are not relevant in this context.",
