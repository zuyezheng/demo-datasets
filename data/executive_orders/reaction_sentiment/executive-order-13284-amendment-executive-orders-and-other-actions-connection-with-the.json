    "critique": "The document is primarily administrative, amending previous executive orders to reflect the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of security and order, but this is conveyed indirectly through the actions themselves rather than through explicit emotional appeals. Therefore, the scores for most emotions will be low. There might be a slightly higher score for fear, as the context is the 'War on Terrorism,' but the document itself doesn't directly evoke fear. Surprise and disgust are unlikely to be relevant. Joy and sadness are also not directly addressed.",
