    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal for resurvey. The tone is neutral and legalistic. As the President, the primary goal is efficient governance and resource management, not necessarily eliciting strong emotions. The actions are administrative. Therefore, I would expect low scores across all emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of reassurance (low fear) for those who depend on proper land management and a bit of surprise to those affected by the order.",
