    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of decisive action and resolve in the face of a serious threat. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to handle the situation. There's also an element of warning to those who might support or engage in terrorist activities. The initial scores reflect this, with fear and disgust directed at the terrorists, and a degree of hope (joy) that the actions will be effective. However, the initial assessment might be too optimistic about the positive emotions and not strong enough on the negative emotions directed at the terrorists. The revised scores adjust these to better reflect the intended message.",
