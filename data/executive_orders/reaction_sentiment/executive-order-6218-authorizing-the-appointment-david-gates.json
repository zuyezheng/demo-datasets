    "critique": "The document focuses on the appointment of Mr. Gates and his qualifications. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and trust in the government's ability to effectively manage the Internal Revenue Service. There is a slight element of 'surprise' that someone is being appointed outside of the civil service rules, but it is justified by his experience. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Joy is also not a primary emotion, but there might be a slight sense of satisfaction that the right person is being appointed.",
