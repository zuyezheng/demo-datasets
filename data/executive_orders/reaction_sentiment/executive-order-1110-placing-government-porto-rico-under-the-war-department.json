    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the administration of Porto Rico. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to stability, confidence, and perhaps a sense of order. There's little room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, further suppressing emotional expression. The actions described are administrative and procedural, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, most scores should be low, reflecting the document's neutral tone.",
