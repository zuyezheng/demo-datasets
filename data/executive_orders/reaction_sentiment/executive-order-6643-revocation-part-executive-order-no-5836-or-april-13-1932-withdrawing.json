As the author, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise for ex-service men and the general public, and perhaps a little sadness that it took so long. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. The tone is formal and legalistic, so the emotions are likely to be muted. Initial scores: joy=5, surprise=3, sadness=2, fear=1, disgust=1, anger=1. Revised scores: joy=6, surprise=4, sadness=3, fear=1, disgust=1, anger=1.",
