As the President, I aim to inspire a sense of security and stability for the tribes, minimizing fear and sadness related to potential land loss. There's a subtle element of joy in ensuring their continued protection, but it's not overtly expressed. Anger and disgust are not intended emotions. Surprise is unlikely, as this is a continuation of existing policy.",
