    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on the transfer of land for military purposes. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security. The transfer is intended to support land-conservation and land-utilization, which should inspire joy. The mention of the land being returned when no longer needed for military purposes should reduce fear and sadness. There's little to suggest anger or disgust. The surprise element is low, as the order follows existing acts and recommendations.",
