    "critique": "The document is a series of amendments to the Selective Service Regulations. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary goal is to efficiently manage the draft process, not to elicit specific emotions. However, some emotions might be indirectly affected. Joy might be felt by those who can volunteer and have a streamlined process. Sadness might be felt by those who are drafted against their will. Fear might be present due to the uncertainty of war. Disgust and anger might be felt by those who are forced to serve or who disagree with the draft. Surprise is unlikely to be a major emotion.",
