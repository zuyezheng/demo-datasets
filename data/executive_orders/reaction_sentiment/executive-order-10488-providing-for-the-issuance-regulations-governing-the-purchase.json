    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the administration of foreign exchange by executive departments and agencies. The tone is authoritative and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the administration of foreign exchange. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and focused on legal compliance.",
