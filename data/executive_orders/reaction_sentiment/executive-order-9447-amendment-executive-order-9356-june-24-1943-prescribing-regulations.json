    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding cash allowances for enlisted personnel. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order, and perhaps a bit of satisfaction that the needs of enlisted personnel are being met. There's no indication of strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is very technical and specific, focusing on amounts and dates. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
