    "critique": "The document aims to evoke joy by improving broadband access, especially in rural areas, leading to economic prosperity and better healthcare and education. It also addresses a current state of sadness and frustration due to the lack of access. There's a sense of urgency to fix the problem, which might imply a past state of neglect or inaction, potentially causing anger. The order also aims to reduce uncertainty and streamline processes, which could alleviate fear related to bureaucratic hurdles. Surprise is less relevant, as the order is more about addressing existing issues than introducing something completely unexpected. Disgust is also less relevant, as the document focuses on solutions rather than dwelling on negative aspects.",
