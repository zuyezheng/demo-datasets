    "critique": "The document focuses on improving government efficiency and effectiveness through better information technology management. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through improved services and efficiency) and a sense of security (through better information security). There might be a slight element of surprise at the extent of the changes and the coordinated approach. Sadness, anger, and disgust are not intended emotions, and would likely be associated with the problems the order is trying to solve, not the order itself. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
