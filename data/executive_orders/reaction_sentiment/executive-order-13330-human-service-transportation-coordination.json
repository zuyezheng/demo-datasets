The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through improved opportunities), and perhaps a reduction in sadness and fear related to transportation challenges. There isn't a strong indication of anger, disgust, or surprise being intentionally conveyed. The language is formal and policy-oriented, suggesting a focus on positive outcomes and reassurance.",
