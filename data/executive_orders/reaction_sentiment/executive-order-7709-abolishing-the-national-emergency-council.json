    "critique": "The document is an executive order that abolishes the National Emergency Council and transfers its funds and property. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so I must infer them from the context. Joy is unlikely, as the document is purely administrative. Sadness is possible, but not the primary goal. Anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely. Surprise is possible, but not the main focus. The initial scores are based on these assumptions.",
