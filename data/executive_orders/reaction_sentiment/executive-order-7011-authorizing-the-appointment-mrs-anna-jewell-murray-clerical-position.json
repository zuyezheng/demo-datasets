    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Anna Jewell Murray to a clerical position in the Treasury Department. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, as the order is intended to help the widow of a long-serving Treasury Department employee. There might also be an element of sadness due to the loss of her husband, but the overall tone is positive and supportive. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as the order is a formal and expected action.",
