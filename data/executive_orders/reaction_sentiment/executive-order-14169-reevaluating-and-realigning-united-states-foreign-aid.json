    "critique": "The document expresses a desire to elicit joy from Americans who believe foreign aid is misaligned with American interests and values. It also aims to instill fear in those who might oppose the President's foreign policy changes. A sense of disgust towards the existing foreign aid system is also conveyed. Surprise is not a primary emotion being conveyed, nor is sadness. There is a slight amount of anger conveyed towards the current system.",
