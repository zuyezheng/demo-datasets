    "critique": "The document discusses amending Schedule A of positions excepted from civil-service rules to prioritize employing members of national homes (likely veterans) for certain roles like chauffeurs, guards, etc., within the Veterans' Administration. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from veterans who will now have preferential access to these jobs. There might also be a degree of surprise at this new amendment. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust evident in the context or intended to be elicited. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
