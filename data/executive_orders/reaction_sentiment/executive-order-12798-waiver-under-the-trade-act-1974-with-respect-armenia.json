    "critique": "The document is a waiver regarding trade relations with Armenia. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely relief or satisfaction that trade can continue without restrictions. There's no indication of strong emotions like anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Sadness is also unlikely. The scores should reflect this.",
