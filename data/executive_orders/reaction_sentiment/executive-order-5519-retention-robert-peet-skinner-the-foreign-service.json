    "critique": "The document is a simple order to retain Robert Peet Skinner on active duty. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit mention of emotions. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is perhaps a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage its personnel effectively. However, the document is so devoid of emotional content that assigning high scores to any emotion would be inappropriate. Most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for confidence or a lack of surprise that the government is handling its affairs.",
