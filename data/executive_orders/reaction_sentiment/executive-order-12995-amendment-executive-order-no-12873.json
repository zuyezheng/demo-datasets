    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding the procurement of recovered materials for paper mills. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are positive, such as joy that the policy is environmentally conscious, and perhaps a sense of surprise that the government is taking such action. I also want to minimize negative emotions like fear or disgust. The language is formal and bureaucratic, so strong emotions are unlikely. Initial scores: Joy: 5, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Revised scores: Joy: 4, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. The revision reflects a more realistic assessment of the emotional impact, considering the document's dry and technical nature.",
