The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for those receiving the award and perhaps surprise at the creation of a new honor. There might be a touch of sadness if the medal is awarded posthumously, but the overall tone is positive and celebratory. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust.",
