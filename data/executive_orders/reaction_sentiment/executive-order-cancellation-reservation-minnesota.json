    "critique": "The document cancels an executive order that set aside land for Indian purposes. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from those who will now have access to the land, and perhaps a sense of inevitability or acceptance from those who might be disappointed. I anticipate some sadness from those who supported the original reservation, some anger from those who feel betrayed, and possibly some fear about the consequences for the Native American population. Disgust might be felt by those who view this as an unethical land grab, and surprise might be felt by those who were not expecting this reversal. I will start with initial scores and then revise them after further consideration.",
