The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (confidence in the market), and a reduction in fear and surprise (by addressing potential problems proactively). There's a slight element of sadness acknowledged due to the existing financial condition, but the overall tone is forward-looking and solution-oriented. Disgust and anger are not primary emotions the document intends to evoke.",
