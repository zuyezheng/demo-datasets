    "critique": "The document is a revocation of an executive order regarding land use. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction from those who will benefit from this change. However, the document is very dry and factual. It's hard to infer any strong emotions from it. The revocation itself might cause sadness in some, but the document doesn't convey that. Surprise is possible, but unlikely. Disgust, fear, and anger are not relevant here.",
