    "critique": "The document is an executive order imposing sanctions on Iran due to human rights abuses. As the President, I would want to elicit feelings of reassurance and confidence in the US government's ability to address international issues and protect human rights. I would also anticipate some level of fear and disgust towards the Iranian government's actions. There might be a small element of surprise at the extent of the sanctions, but overall, the goal is to project strength and resolve.",
