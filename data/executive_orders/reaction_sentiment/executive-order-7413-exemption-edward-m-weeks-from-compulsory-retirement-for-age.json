    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Edward M. Weeks from mandatory retirement. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning efficiently and in the public interest. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document. The tone is formal and legalistic. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not really relevant here. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of reassurance or confidence that the government is handling things competently. Initial scores: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 1. Revised scores: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 1.",
