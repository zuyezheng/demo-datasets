    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding reporting functions related to international trade offsets. The primary goal is to ensure confidentiality and proper data collection for reports to Congress. The tone is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional appeals. As such, the emotions being conveyed are minimal. Initial scores are set to 1 across the board, indicating a lack of strong emotional conveyance. Upon review, the formal and procedural nature of the document suggests that the initial scores are appropriate. There is no intention to elicit strong emotions, but rather to ensure compliance and proper handling of information.",
