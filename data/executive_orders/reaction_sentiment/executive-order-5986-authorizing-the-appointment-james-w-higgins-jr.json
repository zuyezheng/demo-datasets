    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of Mr. James W. Higgins, jr. as a Special Agent in the Internal Revenue Bureau. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence in the government's ability to efficiently manage its personnel and resources. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be relatively low. The order is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury and is in the interest of the service, so the primary emotion is joy.",
