As the author, the President, I am aiming for a sense of order, efficiency, and adherence to standards. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to establish a clear and consistent process for drafting and managing these documents. Therefore, the emotions conveyed are minimal. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all likely to be low. The language is formal and procedural, reinforcing the lack of emotional intent.",
