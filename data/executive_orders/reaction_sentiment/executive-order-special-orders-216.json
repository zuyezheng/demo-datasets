    "critique": "The document is a military order detailing changes in the composition of a military commission. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and confidence in the military's functioning. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, as this is a formal order. Sadness is not intended. Anger is not the goal, but some subordinates might be displeased with the changes. Fear is not the intention, but the order implies authority. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is possible, but not the main goal. Revised scores reflect a slightly higher emphasis on confidence and order.",
