    "critique": "The document is a military order authorizing the suspension of habeas corpus during an insurrection. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of reassurance and resolve, but also perhaps a degree of fear in those fomenting the insurrection. There's not much explicit emotional language, so I'll have to infer from the context. Initial assessment: Joy: 1 (not applicable), Sadness: 2 (a necessary evil), Anger: 3 (towards the insurrectionists), Fear: 4 (in the insurrectionists, and perhaps a little in the general populace to ensure compliance), Disgust: 2 (at the insurrection), Surprise: 1 (not intended). Upon further reflection, the primary goal is to project strength and deter further insurrection. The fear score should be higher to reflect the seriousness of the situation. The anger score should also be slightly higher to show resolve. Revised assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 4, Fear: 6, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 1",
