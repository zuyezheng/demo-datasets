As president, the primary emotion I'd want to elicit is a sense of security and stability for the Omaha Reservation Indians. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy might be a 3, as it provides some benefit. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are all likely 1. Surprise is also likely 1, as this is a routine extension.",
