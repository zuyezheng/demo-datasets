It also seeks to instill a sense of responsibility and action, potentially mitigating fear and disgust related to environmental degradation. Surprise is less prominent, but the order's comprehensive approach might elicit some. Sadness and anger are not the primary emotions the document intends to convey, but they might be present as a contrast to the positive outcomes.",
