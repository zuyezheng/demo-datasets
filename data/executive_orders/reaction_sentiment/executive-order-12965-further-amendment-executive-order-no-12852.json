    "critique": "The document is a simple extension of an existing executive order. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and continuity. There's no strong language to suggest intense emotions. The actions are administrative, so strong emotions are unlikely. The tone is formal and procedural, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
