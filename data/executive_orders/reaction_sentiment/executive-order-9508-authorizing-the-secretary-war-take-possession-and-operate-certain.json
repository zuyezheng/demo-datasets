    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of resolute action taken in the interest of national security during wartime. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is taking necessary steps to prevent disruptions to the war effort. There's also an element of disappointment and perhaps even anger directed at Montgomery Ward for their refusal to comply with the National War Labor Board's directives. However, the overall tone is formal and focused on the legal and practical justifications for the action.",
