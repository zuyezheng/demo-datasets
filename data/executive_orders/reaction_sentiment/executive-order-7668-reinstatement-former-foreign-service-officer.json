    "critique": "The document is a reinstatement order for a Foreign Service officer. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and fairness. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slight emphasis on order and perhaps a touch of satisfaction that justice is being served.",
