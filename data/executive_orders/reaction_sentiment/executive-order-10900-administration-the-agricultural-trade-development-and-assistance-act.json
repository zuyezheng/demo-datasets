    "critique": "The document is a delegation of authority regarding the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954. As such, it is primarily an administrative document. The primary emotions the President would want to elicit are trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage these programs effectively. There is little to suggest strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims for a sense of stability and order.",
