    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a rule regarding classification within the penitentiary service. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and perhaps mild satisfaction that the system is being refined. There's not much room for strong emotions here. Joy would be very low, as would sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. The language is formal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong feelings.",
