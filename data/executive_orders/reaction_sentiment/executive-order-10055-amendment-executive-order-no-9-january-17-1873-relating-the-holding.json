    "critique": "The document expresses a desire to facilitate the establishment of local self-government in the City of Norris, Tennessee. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy and surprise that the residents are now able to govern themselves. There might be a slight element of sadness that the Tennessee Valley Authority is no longer providing all the services, but the overall tone is positive and supportive of the community's self-determination. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust.",
