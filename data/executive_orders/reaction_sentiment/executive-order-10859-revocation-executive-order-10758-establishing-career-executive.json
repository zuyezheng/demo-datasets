    "critique": "The document revokes two executive orders related to the civil service system. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and decisiveness, not strong emotions. The revocation itself might cause some surprise or concern among those affected, but the document doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, I will assign low scores to most emotions, with a slightly higher score for surprise due to the nature of the action.",
