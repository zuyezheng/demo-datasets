    "critique": "The document establishes the Domestic Policy Council and outlines its functions. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of order and control. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through effective policy implementation) and a sense of reduced fear (through coordinated policy-making). There's little to suggest sadness, anger, disgust, or surprise are intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment, but the critique suggests a slight adjustment to emphasize the control and order aspects.",
