    "critique": "The document aims to inspire confidence and hope by establishing agencies and processes for efficient and honest distribution of relief funds and creation of work opportunities. The tone is authoritative and decisive, intending to convey a sense of control and action during a time of crisis. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through job creation and relief), and reduced fear (by addressing the economic crisis). There's also an element of surprise at the scale and speed of the response. Sadness and disgust are emotions the President wants to alleviate, not elicit. There's little to suggest anger is being elicited.",
