The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy through the continuation of relief and work projects. There is a sense of hope and security being conveyed. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not a primary goal, but there might be a slight element of it as people see the continued commitment.",
