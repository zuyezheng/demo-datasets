    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections. The tone is authoritative and legalistic. The primary goal is to enable a Senate committee to investigate labor-management relations. The emotions the President might want to elicit are trust in government, perhaps a sense of justice, and a lack of surprise or fear, as it's a routine legal procedure. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The document is very procedural and unlikely to evoke strong emotions.",
