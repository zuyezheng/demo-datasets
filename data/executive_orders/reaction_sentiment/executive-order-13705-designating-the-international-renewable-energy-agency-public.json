    "critique": "The document designates the International Renewable Energy Agency as a public international organization. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and adherence to international law. There's a focus on not impairing existing rights or creating new enforceable rights, suggesting a desire to avoid strong emotional reactions. The language is formal and legalistic, further minimizing emotional impact. Therefore, the scores are generally low, with a slight emphasis on reducing fear and surprise by clarifying the scope and limitations of the order.",
