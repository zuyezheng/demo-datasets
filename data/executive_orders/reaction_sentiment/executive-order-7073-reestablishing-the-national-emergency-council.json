    "critique": "The document aims to reassure the public during a time of emergency by re-establishing the National Emergency Council. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of joy that the government is taking action to provide relief. There is also an element of surprise that the council is being re-established. There is a low level of fear and sadness, as the document acknowledges the ongoing emergency. Disgust and anger are not relevant in this context. The initial scores are: joy: 7, sadness: 3, anger: 1, fear: 3, disgust: 1, surprise: 5. Upon further reflection, the document is more about stability and reassurance than joy. The surprise element is also less pronounced. The revised scores are: joy: 5, sadness: 3, anger: 1, fear: 3, disgust: 1, surprise: 3.",
