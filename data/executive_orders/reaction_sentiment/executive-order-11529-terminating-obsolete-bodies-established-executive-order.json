    "critique": "The document is a short executive order focused on terminating committees. The tone is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional appeals. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of decisive action and efficiency in streamlining government operations. However, the document is so brief and procedural that it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with low values across all emotions. Upon review, I still believe the document is emotionally neutral, so the revised scores remain the same.",
