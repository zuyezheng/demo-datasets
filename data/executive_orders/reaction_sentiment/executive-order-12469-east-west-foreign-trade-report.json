    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding trade reporting functions. The tone is official and procedural. The primary goal is efficiency in reporting to Congress. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. However, implicit emotions could be present. Joy might be present in the sense of satisfaction from efficient governance, but it's very mild. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise might be present in the sense that the order is effective immediately, but it's also mild. Therefore, the initial scores are: joy: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. Upon further reflection, the immediate effectiveness might cause a bit more surprise, and the efficiency a bit more joy. The other emotions remain unlikely.",
