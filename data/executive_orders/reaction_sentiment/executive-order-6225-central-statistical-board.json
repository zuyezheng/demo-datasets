    "critique": "The document establishes a Central Statistical Board to coordinate statistical services related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (through the promise of economic recovery and improved coordination), and surprise (at the swift action taken to address the economic situation). There might be a small amount of fear and sadness related to the current economic conditions that the act is trying to address, but the overall tone is one of optimism and action. Disgust and anger are not really relevant in this context.",
