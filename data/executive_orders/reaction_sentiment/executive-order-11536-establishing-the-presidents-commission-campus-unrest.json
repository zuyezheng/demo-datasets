    "critique": "The document aims to address campus unrest and violence. As the President, I want to convey a sense of control, order, and a commitment to peaceful resolution. I want to instill confidence that the situation is being handled responsibly. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a reduction in fear and anger, and an increase in a sense of calm and perhaps cautious optimism. The language is formal and authoritative, which should project control. The focus on study, recommendations, and cooperation suggests a rational approach. There's an implicit acknowledgment of the problems (dissent, disorder, violence), but the emphasis is on finding solutions through established processes. Initial scores: Joy: 3 (a little hope), Sadness: 2 (acknowledging the unrest), Anger: 3 (addressing the violence), Fear: 4 (reducing the fear), Disgust: 1 (not a primary emotion), Surprise: 2 (not a primary emotion). Revised scores: Joy: 4, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1",
