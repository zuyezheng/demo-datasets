    "critique": "The document expresses a simple extension of a trust period for Kickapoo Indians. There is no strong emotional language used. As the author, I would hope for a sense of relief and perhaps mild joy that the extension provides continued security. However, the document itself is very bureaucratic and unlikely to elicit strong emotions. Therefore, I will score joy as 2, and all other emotions as 1 initially. Upon review, I think surprise could be a 2 as it is unexpected.",
