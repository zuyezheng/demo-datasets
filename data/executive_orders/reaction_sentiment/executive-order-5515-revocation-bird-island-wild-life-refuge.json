    "critique": "The document revokes Executive Order No. 5349, which reserved Bird or Hat Island for the Department of Agriculture as a refuge and breeding ground for wild animals and birds. As the President, I might want to elicit a sense of efficiency and decisiveness, perhaps a little surprise that an old order is being revoked. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. I don't think the document is trying to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The primary emotion might be surprise, but it's very mild.",
