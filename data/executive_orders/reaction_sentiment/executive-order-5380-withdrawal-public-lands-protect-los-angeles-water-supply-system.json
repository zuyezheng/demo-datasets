    "critique": "The document is a legal order withdrawing land from settlement to protect Los Angeles' water supply. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy from the citizens of Los Angeles who will benefit from a protected water supply. There might be some sadness or anger from those who are restricted from settling on the land, but the overall tone is one of necessary action for the greater good. Surprise is unlikely to be a major factor.",
