    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on ending hunger and promoting economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, I will adjust the scores slightly to better reflect the intended emotional impact. I will increase the 'joy' score to emphasize the positive outcome of ending hunger and promoting economic growth. I will also slightly increase the 'surprise' score to reflect the potential for unexpected positive developments in the region. The other scores remain relatively low, as the document primarily aims to inspire hope and confidence rather than evoke negative emotions.",
