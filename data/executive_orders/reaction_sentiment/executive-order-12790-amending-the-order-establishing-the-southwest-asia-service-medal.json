    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order. The tone is formal and legalistic. The actions are related to the Uniformed Services and the award of the Southwest Asia Service Medal. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to respect for the military and a sense of order and efficiency. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low for all emotions.",
