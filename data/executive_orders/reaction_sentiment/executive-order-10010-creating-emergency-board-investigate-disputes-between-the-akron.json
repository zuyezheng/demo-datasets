    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing disputes between railroad companies and their employees. The primary goal is to prevent interruption of interstate commerce. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming to project authority and impartiality. The desired emotions are likely a sense of stability, order, and confidence in the government's ability to manage crises. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy or sadness. Fear and disgust are unlikely to be intended, but a mild sense of surprise at the government intervention might be present. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
