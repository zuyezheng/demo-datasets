    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding clothing allowances for members of the Naval Reserve and Coast Guard Reserve. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of fairness and support for the troops, though this is a very technical document. There's no strong language to suggest intense emotions. Joy might be present in a small way as those affected may be happy to receive the allowance. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely, as this is a fairly routine adjustment.",
