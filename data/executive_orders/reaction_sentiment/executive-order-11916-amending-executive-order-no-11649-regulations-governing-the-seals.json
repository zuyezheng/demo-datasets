    "critique": "The document is a minor amendment to an existing executive order. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably related to order and respect for the law. There is not enough information to suggest strong emotions. The initial scores are set to low values across the board. The critique suggests that the initial scores are reasonable given the nature of the document. The revised scores remain the same.",
