    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a wildlife refuge. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who value wildlife. There might be some sadness from those who can no longer hunt or use the land as they did before, and perhaps some surprise at the action. There isn't likely to be much anger, fear, or disgust associated with this action. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly increase the joy score to reflect the positive impact of the order.",
