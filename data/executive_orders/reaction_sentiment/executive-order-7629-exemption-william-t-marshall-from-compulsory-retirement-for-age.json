    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of William T. Marshall from compulsory retirement. As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of stability, competence, and judicious use of power. The primary emotions I want to elicit are reassurance and confidence in my leadership. There is little to suggest strong emotions. The document is mostly procedural. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. I will revise the scores to reflect a slightly higher sense of reassurance and confidence, which could translate to a mild sense of joy and reduced fear.",
