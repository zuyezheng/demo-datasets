    "critique": "The document is a standard executive order regarding the order of succession for the Attorney General. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order in the government. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as succession plans are common. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slight emphasis on reducing fear and promoting a sense of order.",
