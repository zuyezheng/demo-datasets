    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the inspection of income tax returns by a House committee. The primary goal is to enable the committee's investigation of crime. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to address crime and perhaps a sense of surprise that such measures are being taken. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
