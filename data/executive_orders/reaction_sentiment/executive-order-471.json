    "critique": "The document is a military order from the War Department, likely during a time of conflict. As the President, the primary goal is to maintain order and ensure the draft is successful. The language is authoritative and leaves little room for interpretation. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely fear (to deter draft dodging), and perhaps a sense of surprise at the extent of the order. There is little room for joy or sadness in such a document. Disgust might be present towards those who attempt to evade the draft. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The revised scores are adjusted slightly to better reflect the intensity of the emotions conveyed by the document.",
