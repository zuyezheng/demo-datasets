    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal in New Mexico. The tone is formal and objective. The primary goal is to enact a policy, not to elicit specific emotions. Therefore, most emotions would have low scores. There might be a slight sense of reassurance (low fear) that the land is being managed, and perhaps a touch of disappointment (low sadness) for those who might have wanted to settle there. Surprise, disgust, and joy are unlikely to be conveyed.",
