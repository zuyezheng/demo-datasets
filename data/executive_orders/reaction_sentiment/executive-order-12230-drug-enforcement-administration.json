    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the competitive status of special agents. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of satisfaction and perhaps a bit of surprise that the agents are being recognized. There isn't much emotional language, so most scores will be low. The order aims to improve the career prospects of Drug Enforcement Administration agents, potentially eliciting joy. However, the language is formal and bureaucratic, so the intensity of joy is likely low. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the noncompetitive conversion to career appointments.",
