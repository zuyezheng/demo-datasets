    "critique": "The document focuses on national security and economic prosperity through cybersecurity improvements. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and confidence. There's also an element of fear regarding cyber threats, but the order aims to mitigate that. Joy is present in the sense of promoting economic prosperity and innovation. Sadness and disgust are less relevant, though there's an implicit sadness about the current state of vulnerability. Surprise is not a major factor.",
