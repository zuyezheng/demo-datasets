    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in New Mexico. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief and perhaps a bit of joy that a bureaucratic hurdle has been cleared. However, the document is very dry and procedural, so the intensity of any emotion is likely to be low. There's no real sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this action. Surprise is also unlikely, as this is a routine administrative matter. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low values across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
