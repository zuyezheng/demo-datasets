    "critique": "The document focuses on land allocation for Native American purposes. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from the Native Americans who will benefit from the land, and perhaps a sense of justice or fairness. There might be some sadness from those who had hoped to settle on the land, but the order explicitly protects existing valid rights. Fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be strong emotions elicited by this order. Initial scores: joy: 7, sadness: 3, anger: 2, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. Revised scores: Upon further reflection, the order is more about rectifying a wrong and ensuring fairness. The joy might be tempered by the historical context. The sadness and anger might be slightly higher from those whose expansion is limited. Revised scores: joy: 6, sadness: 4, anger: 3, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2.",
