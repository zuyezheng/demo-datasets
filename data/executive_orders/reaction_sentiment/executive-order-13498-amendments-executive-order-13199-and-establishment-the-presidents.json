It also seeks to alleviate fear by emphasizing the preservation of constitutional commitments and accountability for taxpayer dollars. Surprise is not a primary emotion intended to be elicited. There is a slight element of sadness for the underserved, but it is not a dominant emotion. Disgust and anger are not intended emotions.",
