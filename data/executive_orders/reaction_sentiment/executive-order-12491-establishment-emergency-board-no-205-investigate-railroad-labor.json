    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate a dispute. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to stability, order, and resolution rather than strong displays of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for a sense of calm and control. Initial scores are assigned based on this understanding.\n\nRevised scores consider that the document aims to project an image of control and resolution, minimizing negative emotions and promoting a sense of stability. Surprise is slightly increased to reflect the action taken.",
