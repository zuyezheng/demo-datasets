    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for air-navigation facilities. The tone is formal and factual. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning efficiently. There is no explicit emotional appeal, so the scores should be low. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think a slight sense of confidence and perhaps mild surprise at the efficiency could be intended. I will revise the surprise score to 2.",
