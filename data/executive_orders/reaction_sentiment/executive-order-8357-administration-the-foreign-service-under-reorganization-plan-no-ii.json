    "critique": "The document is a set of regulations regarding officers designated by the Secretaries of Commerce and Agriculture to serve abroad or as liaison officers. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency, not strong emotions. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board. The initial scores are all 1. After further consideration, I think a slight increase in surprise is warranted due to the reorganization plan.",
