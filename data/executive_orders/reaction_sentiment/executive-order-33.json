    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land reservation for a lighthouse. The tone is formal and objective. There's no explicit emotional appeal. However, one could argue that the act of reserving land for a lighthouse might evoke a sense of security (reducing fear) and perhaps a little joy in those who benefit from it. Sadness, anger, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be evoked by such a document. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
