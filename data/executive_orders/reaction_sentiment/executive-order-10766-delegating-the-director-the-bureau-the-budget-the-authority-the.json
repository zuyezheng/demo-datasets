    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority regarding housing regulations for uniformed service members. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and order. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a desired emotion. The language is legalistic and focused on delegation of power, not emotional appeal. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
