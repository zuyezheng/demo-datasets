    "critique": "The document is an executive order imposing sanctions on the Crimea region of Ukraine. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of resolve and seriousness regarding the situation. I want to convey a message of strength and determination to address the issue. There might be some sadness associated with the situation in Ukraine, but the main focus is on taking action. There could be some fear and disgust towards the actions that prompted the order. Surprise is not a primary emotion here, as the order is a continuation of previous actions.",
