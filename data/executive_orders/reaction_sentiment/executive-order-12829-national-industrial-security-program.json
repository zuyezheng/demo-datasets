    "critique": "The document aims to establish a program to safeguard classified information. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect national interests. There's also an element of reassurance that economic and technological interests are being preserved. The tone is formal and authoritative, reflecting the importance of the subject matter. There is no intention to elicit sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not a primary goal, but the comprehensive nature of the program might evoke a mild sense of it.",
