    "critique": "The document outlines regulations for transporting liquor through the Canal Zone. As the President, my primary goal is to ensure smooth and legal transit while adhering to existing laws. The tone is formal and authoritative, focusing on compliance and control. I want to convey a sense of order and adherence to the law, minimizing negative emotions and promoting a sense of controlled approval. The actions are designed to prevent illegal consumption or delivery within the Canal Zone, which could elicit joy from those who want to break the law, and sadness, anger, fear, and disgust from those who want to uphold the law. Surprise is not really a factor.",
