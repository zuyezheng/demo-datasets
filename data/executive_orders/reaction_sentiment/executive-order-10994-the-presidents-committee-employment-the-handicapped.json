    "critique": "The document aims to establish a committee to promote employment opportunities for the handicapped. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from the hope of improved opportunities for this group. There might also be a sense of hope and reduced fear among the handicapped due to the initiative. The language is formal and bureaucratic, so strong emotions are unlikely. There is a slight element of surprise that such a committee is being formed, but it is not a major factor. There is no indication of anger or disgust.",
