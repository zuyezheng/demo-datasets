The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of security (reduced fear), confidence (increased joy), and acceptance of the necessary measures (reduced disgust and sadness). Surprise is not a major factor. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores fine-tune the emphasis on security and confidence.",
