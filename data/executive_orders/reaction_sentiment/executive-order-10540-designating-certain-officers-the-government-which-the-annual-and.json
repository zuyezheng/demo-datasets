    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the application of the Annual and Sick Leave Act of 1951. It designates certain officers to whom the act does not apply and delegates authority to the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to make such designations. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are confidence in the government's ability to manage its personnel and perhaps a sense of order and efficiency. There's not much room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a factor if people are unaware of these types of internal governmental adjustments.",
