    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the settlement of intercustodial conflicts involving enemy property. The language is legal and procedural, focusing on authorization, delegation, and administration of property. The primary goal is to efficiently manage and resolve property disputes related to the Trading with the Enemy Act. There is little emotional content in the document. The emotions I want to elicit are low. The initial scores are all 1. After thinking about it, I think that there might be a slight amount of joy that American interests are being protected, and a slight amount of surprise that this is being handled in this way. I will adjust the scores accordingly.",
