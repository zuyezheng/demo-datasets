    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal for migratory bird refuge purposes. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of assurance and trust in the government's actions towards conservation. There's a subtle element of joy associated with protecting wildlife, but it's not overtly emphasized. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely, as such orders are typically part of a larger, planned conservation effort. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
