    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on financial accountability and procedural correctness within consular services. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming to ensure compliance and prevent embezzlement. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are trust in the government's financial management and confidence in the integrity of consular operations. There's also an element of deterrence against fraudulent activities. Given the nature of the document, strong emotions are unlikely. Joy is minimal as it's a regulatory document. Sadness is also minimal. Anger might be present towards those who might consider fraudulent activities, but it's not a primary focus. Fear is present as a deterrent. Disgust is present towards corruption. Surprise is not a primary emotion.",
