The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and trust in the government's ability to manage resources efficiently. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and administrative. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
