    "critique": "The document aims to establish an advisory council on science, technology, and innovation. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for progress and innovation), and perhaps a sense of reduced fear (through improved security and public health). There might be a slight element of surprise due to the establishment of the council itself. Sadness, anger, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. The language is formal and aims for a sense of progress and security.",
