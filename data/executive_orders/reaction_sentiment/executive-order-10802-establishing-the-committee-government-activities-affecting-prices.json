    "critique": "The document aims to address economic instability and price fluctuations. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (or at least a sense of relief and confidence) that the government is taking action to stabilize the economy. There might be a secondary desire to reduce fear and anxiety related to economic uncertainty. The tone is formal and authoritative, suggesting a serious and responsible approach. There's little to suggest anger, disgust, or surprise as intended emotions.",
