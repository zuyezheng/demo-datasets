    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for the New Mexico National Guard. The tone is formal and factual. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security in the government's ability to manage resources and provide for national defense. There's no explicit emotional appeal, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, as it's a formal order. Sadness is not relevant. Anger is not the intention. Fear might be slightly present, as national defense is involved. Disgust is not applicable. Surprise is unlikely, as it's a routine administrative action.",
