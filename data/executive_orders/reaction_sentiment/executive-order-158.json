    "critique": "The document expresses somber respect and gratitude for soldiers who died in the Spanish-American War. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are sadness for the loss, joy in honoring their sacrifice, and a sense of national unity and pride. There is no anger, fear, or disgust present. Surprise is not a major factor, but a slight sense of awe at their sacrifice might be present. The initial scores reflect these observations. The revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the relative intensity of each emotion based on the document's tone and content.",
