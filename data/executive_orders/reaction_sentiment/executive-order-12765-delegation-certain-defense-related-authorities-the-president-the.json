    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on delegating authority to the Secretary of Defense regarding military matters. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security through efficient military command and resource allocation. There's a subtle element of surprise in the immediate effectiveness of the order. There isn't much to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
