    "critique": "The document aims to improve the management of executive agencies by retaining and effectively using top-rank officers. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through improved efficiency and recognition of competent executives), and perhaps a bit of surprise (through the establishment of new structures and processes). There's no indication of wanting to elicit sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The tone is formal and administrative, focusing on competence and effectiveness.",
