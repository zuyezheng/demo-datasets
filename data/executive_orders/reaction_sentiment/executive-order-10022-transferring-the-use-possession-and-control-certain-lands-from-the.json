    "critique": "The document is a transfer of property from the Department of the Army to the Tennessee Valley Authority. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning properly and efficiently. There is a slight element of joy that the transfer is deemed necessary and proper for the purposes of the Authority. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight element of surprise that such a transfer is taking place, but it is minimal.",
