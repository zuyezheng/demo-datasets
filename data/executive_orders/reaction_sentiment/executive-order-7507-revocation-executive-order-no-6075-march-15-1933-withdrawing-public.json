    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands. The tone is formal and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in governance. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy, sadness, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise might be a little higher due to the action of revoking a previous order.",
