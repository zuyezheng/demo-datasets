    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of the Electrical Contracting Chapter of the Code of Fair Competition for the Construction Industry. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's actions. There is little to suggest strong emotions. Joy would be low, as would sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. The document aims for a sense of order and progress, but not strong emotional reactions.",
