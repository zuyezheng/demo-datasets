    "critique": "The document is a directive to the Postmaster-General to amend the classification of the Post-Office Department. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency. There is not enough information to determine the intensity of each emotion, so I will start with a baseline score of 1 for each and then adjust based on the text. The President is trying to improve the civil service, so there may be some joy. The directive is not likely to elicit sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There may be a small amount of surprise that the classification is being amended.",
