    "critique": "The document is an executive order that withdraws public lands for the use of the Pima and Maricopa Indians. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise from the Pima and Maricopa Indians, and perhaps a sense of security and hope. There might be some sadness or anger from those who wanted to purchase the land, but the overall tone is one of positive action for the benefit of the Native American tribes. The language is formal and legalistic, but the context suggests a benevolent intent. Initial scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 3, Anger: 3, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 5. Revised scores: Joy: 8, Sadness: 2, Anger: 2, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 6.",
