    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for the National Guard. The tone is formal and objective. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security (joy) that the National Guard has the resources it needs. There might be a slight element of surprise that such an order is being issued, but overall the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores are joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. After reflection, the surprise is probably not intended, and the joy score is likely a bit high. Revised scores: joy: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
