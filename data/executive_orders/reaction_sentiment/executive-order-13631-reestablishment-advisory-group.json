As such, the emotions it seeks to evoke are minimal. It seems to aim for a sense of stability and continuity (reestablishing an advisory group) and to avoid creating any legal liabilities or expectations. Initial scores: Joy: 2 (sense of stability), Sadness: 1 (no intention to evoke sadness), Anger: 1 (no intention to evoke anger), Fear: 1 (no intention to evoke fear), Disgust: 1 (no intention to evoke disgust), Surprise: 1 (no intention to evoke surprise).
