    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute. As the President, the primary goal is to resolve the dispute and ensure national health and safety. The tone is formal and authoritative. The emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a desired emotion. The initial scores reflect this: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, but I will slightly increase the fear score to 3 to reflect the potential impact on national health and safety if the strike continues.",
