The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (relief and hope), and a reduction of fear and sadness. There's also an element of control and authority, which might elicit some surprise or even disgust from those who oppose US involvement. The language is formal and authoritative, emphasizing the legal basis for the actions. The focus is on re-establishment and rehabilitation, suggesting a desire to alleviate suffering and promote recovery.",
