    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of responsibility and protection of US interests, specifically regarding oil and gas resources. It uses formal language and focuses on the necessity of preventing loss to the United States. The emotions I want to convey are responsibility, protection, and efficiency. The initial scores reflect this, with a moderate level of concern (fear) about potential loss and a sense of purpose (joy) in taking action. After further consideration, I've adjusted the scores to better reflect the intended emotional impact. I want to emphasize the proactive nature of the order and the importance of safeguarding national resources.",
