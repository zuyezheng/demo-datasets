As the author, the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of order, control, and perhaps a bit of reassurance that the borders are being managed effectively. There isn't a strong push for joy or sadness, but a sense of security and perhaps a little surprise at the level of detail might be present. Disgust and fear are not intended emotions.",
