    "critique": "The document revokes Executive Order No. 7520, which withdrew lands for use of the War Department as a target range for the Arizona National Guard. As the President, I would want to elicit a sense of resolution and efficiency in correcting outdated orders. The primary emotion I want to convey is a mild sense of satisfaction or perhaps a slight surprise that such an order was still in effect. There isn't strong emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy is minimal, as it's a routine administrative action. Sadness is negligible. Anger is not intended. Fear is not relevant. Disgust is not applicable. Surprise might be a little higher, reflecting the unexpected nature of the revocation of an old order.",
