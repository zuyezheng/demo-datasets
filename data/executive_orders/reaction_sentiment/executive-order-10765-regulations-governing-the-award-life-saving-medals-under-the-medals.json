    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the award of life-saving medals. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are respect for the process, confidence in the fairness of the award, and perhaps a sense of security knowing that acts of bravery are recognized. There isn't a strong emotional component, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy might be present in a small way, as people are being recognized for heroic acts. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not really relevant here. Surprise is also unlikely.",
