The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of resolution or perhaps minor satisfaction in correcting or adjusting a previous decision. There's no strong indication of any particular emotion. Therefore, most scores should be low. Joy, surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness are unlikely to be intended emotions. A slight sense of resolution might translate to a very mild sense of satisfaction or closure.",
