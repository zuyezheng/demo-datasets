    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. The document is a formal order, so strong emotions are unlikely. Joy is low because it's not a celebratory document. Sadness is low as there's no loss implied. Anger and disgust are minimal as the order is presented neutrally. Fear is slightly higher due to the potential impact on land use. Surprise is moderate as the order might be unexpected to some. The revised scores reflect a slight adjustment to emphasize the formal and neutral tone.",
