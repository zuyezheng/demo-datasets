    "critique": "The document outlines economic sanctions against Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait. As the President, the primary goal is to project strength and resolve, deter further aggression, and protect Kuwait's assets. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for a tone of authority and decisiveness. The desired emotions are a mix of reassurance to allies, a warning to Iraq, and a sense of stability and control domestically. Joy is not a primary emotion sought, nor is sadness. Fear and disgust are relevant but not dominant. Surprise is not a desired emotion. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
