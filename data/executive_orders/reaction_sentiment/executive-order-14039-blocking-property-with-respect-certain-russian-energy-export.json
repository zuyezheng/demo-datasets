    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of resolve and determination in addressing a national emergency. It uses legal and formal language, which suggests a serious and authoritative tone. The blocking of assets and prohibition of transactions are intended to create a sense of fear and disgust in those targeted, while also reassuring allies and the American public. The document does not explicitly aim to evoke joy or sadness. Surprise is not a primary emotion, as the actions are presented as a logical response to a declared emergency.",
