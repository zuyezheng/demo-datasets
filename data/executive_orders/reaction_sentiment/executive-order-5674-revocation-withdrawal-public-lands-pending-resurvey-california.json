    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order and an opening of lands for homesteading, first to ex-service men and then to the general public. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from ex-service men who will have priority in claiming land. A secondary emotion might be a mild surprise that the lands are being opened up. There's little to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
