    "critique": "The document is a very dry and procedural amendment to an existing executive order. It deals with allowances for employees assigned to duty at Johnston Island. There is no indication of an attempt to elicit any strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction that government processes are being maintained and updated, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, I will score most emotions as very low, with a slight bump for surprise that such a specific and seemingly minor issue is being addressed directly by an executive order.",
