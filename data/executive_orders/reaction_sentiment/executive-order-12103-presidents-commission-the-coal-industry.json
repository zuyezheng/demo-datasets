    "critique": "The document aims to address the state of the coal industry. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (through improved economic health and safety), and perhaps a reduction in fear and sadness related to job security and living conditions. There might be a desire to reduce disgust related to the industry's image. Surprise is less relevant here. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The critique acknowledges the focus on positive outcomes and addresses potential negative emotions. The revised scores adjust the intensity based on the document's emphasis.",
