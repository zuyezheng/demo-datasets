    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of approved rules for the Light-House Service. The tone is official and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and confidence in the government's ability to manage its services effectively. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and focused on the implementation of rules. Therefore, most emotions would be rated low. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. I increased joy slightly to reflect the positive aspect of implementing order and efficiency.",
