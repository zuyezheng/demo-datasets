    "critique": "The document is a short executive order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Florence Bankhead. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a mild sense of satisfaction or perhaps even surprise that such an appointment can be made without the usual civil service rules. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The order seems routine, so I'll adjust the surprise score down slightly.",
