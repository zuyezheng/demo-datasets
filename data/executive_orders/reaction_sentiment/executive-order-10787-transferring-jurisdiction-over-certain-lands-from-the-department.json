As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage resources effectively. There's no strong emotional language used, so the scores should be relatively low. Joy might be present in a small way as the land is being used for conservation. There might be a little surprise as people learn about the transfer of land.",
