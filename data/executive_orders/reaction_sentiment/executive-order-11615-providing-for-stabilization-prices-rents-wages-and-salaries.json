The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (economic stability), and perhaps a reduction in fear (of economic hardship). There might be some sadness or anger from those who feel restricted by the price controls, but the overall goal is positive. Surprise is not a major factor. Disgust is not relevant.",
