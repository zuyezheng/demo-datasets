    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and resolution, not strong emotions. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for neutrality. The language is precise and avoids emotional appeals. The context is a potential disruption of interstate commerce, which could cause anxiety, but the order aims to prevent that. Therefore, I would score joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all low initially. I will revise the scores to reflect a slightly higher sense of reassurance and reduced fear, but overall, the goal is to minimize strong emotional reactions.",
