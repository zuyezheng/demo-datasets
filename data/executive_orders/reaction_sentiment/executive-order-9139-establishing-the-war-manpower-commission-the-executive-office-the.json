The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through effective utilization of manpower and successful war prosecution), and reduced fear (by assuring the nation is organized and prepared). There might be some sadness due to the war itself, but the document focuses on solutions. Surprise and disgust are less relevant here.",
