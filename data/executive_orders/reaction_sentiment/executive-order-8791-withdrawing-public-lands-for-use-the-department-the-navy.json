    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for military use. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and authoritative. The actions are decisive. The initial scores are all 1 except for surprise which is 2 because land usage is being changed. After thinking through it, I realized that the document is intended to inspire confidence and security, so I will increase the joy score to 3.",
