    "critique": "The document outlines a process for design review in Washington D.C. to ensure aesthetic quality. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to inspire confidence and order rather than strong emotional responses. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and perhaps mild satisfaction that the city's appearance will be well-maintained. There's no explicit attempt to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. Upon review, I realize that 'confidence' isn't directly measurable with the available emotions, but the closest would be a low level of joy that things are being handled well and a slightly higher level of surprise that such a detailed order is being given.",
