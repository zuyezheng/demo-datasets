    "critique": "The document aims to promote religious, moral, and recreational welfare in the armed forces to enhance military preparedness and national security. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through welfare and recreation), and a sense of security (reducing fear). There's an element of surprise in establishing a new committee. Sadness, disgust, and anger are not primary emotions intended to be conveyed, so they should be low. The initial scores are based on this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust the joy and surprise scores to better reflect the document's intent.",
