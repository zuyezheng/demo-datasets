    "critique": "The document expresses concern about the demoralization and expense caused by the sale of intoxicating liquors in the Army. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a reduction in sadness and disgust related to the negative consequences of alcohol consumption, and an increase in joy and surprise related to the positive impact of the new policy. There might also be a reduction in fear related to the negative consequences of alcohol consumption. The initial scores are based on this assessment, and the revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the document's intent.",
