    "critique": "The document revokes Executive Order No. 2124, which established the Ediz Hook Reservation for the protection of native birds. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is neither strong nor negative. The document is a simple revocation of a previous order. There is no strong language or tone to suggest any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions. The initial scores are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. After further consideration, I believe that the act of revoking an order might elicit a slight sense of surprise, so I will increase the surprise score to 2. The revised scores are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
