    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding actions and policies of the de facto regime in Haiti. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of resolve and perhaps a degree of fear in those who might be targeted by the order. There's also an element of sadness related to the situation in Haiti that necessitates this order. Surprise is not really an emotion I'm aiming for, nor is joy or disgust. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression, but the underlying message is one of serious action.",
