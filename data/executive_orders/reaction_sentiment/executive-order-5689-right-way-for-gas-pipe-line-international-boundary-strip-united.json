    "critique": "The document is a modification to a previous proclamation regarding land use along the US-Mexico border for a gas pipeline. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of progress and efficiency in resource management. The tone is formal and administrative, suggesting a focus on practical matters rather than emotional appeals. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Initial scores: Joy: 3 (sense of progress), Sadness: 1 (no reason for sadness), Anger: 1 (no reason for anger), Fear: 1 (no reason for fear), Disgust: 1 (no reason for disgust), Surprise: 2 (minor adjustment to existing policy). Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
