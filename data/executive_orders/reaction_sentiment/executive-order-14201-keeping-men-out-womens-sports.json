    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's content and tone. The document aims to evoke joy in those who support women's sports, sadness in those who feel women are being treated unfairly, anger towards those who allow men to compete in women's sports, fear about the safety of women in sports, disgust at the unfairness of the situation, and surprise at the extent of the problem. However, the initial scores might be slightly too high across the board. I will revise them to better reflect the relative intensity of each emotion.",
