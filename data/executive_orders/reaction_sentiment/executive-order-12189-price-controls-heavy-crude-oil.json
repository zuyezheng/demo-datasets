    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the definition of heavy oil and its exemption from price controls. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage the energy sector. The language is technical and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional appeal. There is a slight sense of joy that the order will help the oil industry, but it is not the primary goal. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the order is being issued, but it is not significant.",
