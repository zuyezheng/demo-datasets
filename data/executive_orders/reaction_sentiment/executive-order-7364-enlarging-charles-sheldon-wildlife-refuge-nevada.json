    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land withdrawal for wildlife refuge. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for conservation and perhaps surprise at the extent of the action. There might be some sadness from those who lose access to the land, and potentially disgust or anger from those who disagree with the policy. Fear is unlikely to be a significant emotion elicited by this document. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
