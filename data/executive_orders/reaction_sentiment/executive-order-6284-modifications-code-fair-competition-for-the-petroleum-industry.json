    "critique": "The President wants to convey a sense of control, fairness, and progress through these modifications to the Code of Fair Competition for the Petroleum Industry. The language used is formal and authoritative, aiming to instill confidence in the government's ability to manage the industry for the benefit of all stakeholders. The emphasis on protecting consumers, competitors, and employees suggests a desire to elicit joy and reduce fear. The detailed regulations and adjustments indicate a commitment to fairness and order, potentially reducing disgust and surprise. However, the complexity of the regulations and the potential for government intervention might also evoke some fear and sadness among those who prefer less regulation. The overall tone is one of measured optimism and determination to improve the industry.",
