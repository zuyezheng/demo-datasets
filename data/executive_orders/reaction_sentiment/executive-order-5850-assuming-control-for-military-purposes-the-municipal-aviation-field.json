    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the control of an aviation field. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security. The order is for military purposes, so I want to convey a sense of strength and preparedness. There is not enough information to suggest any strong emotions. The order is a formal declaration, so the emotions are likely to be muted. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3.
