    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Hilda McTeer to a position in the classified service of the Government. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that Mrs. McTeer, the widow of a long-serving Treasury Department employee, is being taken care of after her husband's death. There may also be an element of sadness for the loss of Mr. McTeer and the difficult situation faced by his widow and child. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and official, but also compassionate and supportive.",
