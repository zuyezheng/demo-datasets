    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land use in Wyoming. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are likely related to trust, security, and perhaps a sense of order and efficiency. There's no strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy is unlikely, sadness is irrelevant, anger is not intended, fear might be slightly present due to the War Department's involvement, disgust is not applicable, and surprise is not a goal. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I'll adjust them slightly to reflect the subtle nuances.",
