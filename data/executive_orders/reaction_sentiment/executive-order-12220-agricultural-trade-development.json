    "critique": "The document is primarily concerned with delegating authority and revising existing delegations related to the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotional responses. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage agricultural trade and assistance effectively. There is little to suggest any strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Most scores should be low, reflecting the administrative nature of the document.",
