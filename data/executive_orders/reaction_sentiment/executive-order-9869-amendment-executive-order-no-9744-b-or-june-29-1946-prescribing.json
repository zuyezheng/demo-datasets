The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (through increased pay) and perhaps a reduction in sadness or fear related to financial concerns. Surprise and disgust are unlikely to be relevant. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, so the intensity of any emotion is likely to be low.",
