The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (in preserving nature), and perhaps a bit of fear (of the penalties for violating the rules) and disgust (at the thought of harming the environment). There's not much sadness, anger, or surprise intended. The initial scores reflect this, but I'll revise them to better capture the relative intensities.",
