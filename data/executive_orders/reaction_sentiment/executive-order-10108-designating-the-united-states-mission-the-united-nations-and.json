    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order, primarily focused on establishing and organizing the United States Mission to the United Nations.

Therefore, the emotions elicited are likely to be minimal. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.
