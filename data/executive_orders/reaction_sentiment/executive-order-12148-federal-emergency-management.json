    "critique": "The document is primarily concerned with transferring and consolidating emergency management functions under the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The tone is formal and legalistic, focusing on the efficient and effective management of resources and responsibilities. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security in the government's ability to handle emergencies. There is a secondary emotion of surprise that the government is taking such a large step to consolidate these agencies. There is little to no emotion of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
