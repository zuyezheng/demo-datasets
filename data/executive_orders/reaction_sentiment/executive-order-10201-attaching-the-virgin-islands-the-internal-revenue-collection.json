    "critique": "The document is a simple administrative order regarding the Virgin Islands and its tax status. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a factor, but it is unlikely to be strong.",
