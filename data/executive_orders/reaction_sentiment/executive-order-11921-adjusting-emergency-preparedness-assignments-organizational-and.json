    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order related to national emergency preparedness. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of security, confidence in the government's ability to handle emergencies, and perhaps a sense of calm reassurance. The language is formal and bureaucratic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional responses. The focus is on reorganizing and clarifying responsibilities among various agencies. I will score the emotions based on this understanding. I will now revise the scores based on the critique.",
