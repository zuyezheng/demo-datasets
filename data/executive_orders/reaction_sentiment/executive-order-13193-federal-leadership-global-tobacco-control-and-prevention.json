    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on public health and international cooperation to combat tobacco use. The language is formal and policy-oriented, suggesting a desire to convey seriousness and determination rather than strong emotional appeals. However, the initial scores might be slightly too low across the board. The policy aims to reduce harm and protect children, which could elicit a stronger sense of joy (relief, hope) and a stronger sense of disgust (at the harm caused by tobacco). The revised scores reflect these adjustments.",
