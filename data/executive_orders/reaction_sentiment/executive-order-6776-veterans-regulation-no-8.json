    "critique": "The document cancels a previous executive order. As the author, the president likely wants to convey a sense of decisiveness and perhaps a bit of relief that an outdated regulation is being removed. There isn't much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy might be present in a small amount due to progress, and surprise is unlikely. Sadness, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context. The initial scores are joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable given the limited emotional content. I will adjust joy slightly downward as the action is more administrative than celebratory.",
