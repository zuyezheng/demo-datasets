    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the International Fund for Agricultural Development as a public international organization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in international cooperation. There is a slight element of joy in facilitating international development, but it is not a strong emotion. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a very slight surprise that this designation is happening now, but it's minimal.",
