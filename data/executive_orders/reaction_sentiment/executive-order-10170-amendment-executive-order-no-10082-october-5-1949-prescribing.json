    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order, focusing on adding the Department of the Interior to existing committees. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and interdepartmental cooperation. There's no strong emotional appeal intended. The emotions conveyed are minimal, with perhaps a slight sense of satisfaction that the government is functioning and adapting. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
