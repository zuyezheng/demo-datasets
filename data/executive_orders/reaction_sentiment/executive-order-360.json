The tone is formal and authoritative, emphasizing fidelity, honesty, and efficiency. There's an attempt to balance political rights with the need for a competent civil service. The document also aims to reduce corruption and political influence in appointments. The language is measured and legalistic, focusing on rules and regulations. There is a sense of surprise that these rules are being enacted, but also a sense of joy that the civil service will be improved. There is a sense of sadness that the old ways are being replaced, but also a sense of anger that the old ways were corrupt. There is a sense of fear that the new rules will be difficult to implement, but also a sense of disgust that the old ways were so bad.",
