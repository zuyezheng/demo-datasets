    "critique": "The document is an executive order setting aside land for the Papago and other Indians. As the President, I would primarily want to elicit joy and perhaps a sense of surprise (a positive one) from the Native Americans who will benefit from this order. I would also anticipate some sadness from those who may have been hoping to settle on this land. There might be some fear or disgust from those who are against the order, but I would hope to minimize those emotions. The language is formal and direct, which doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion, but the act itself is intended to bring about positive feelings for the Native Americans. Initial scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 2, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 5. Upon further reflection, the surprise might be lower, as such orders were not entirely uncommon. Also, the joy might be a bit lower, as the order is relatively small in scope. Revised scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 2, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 3.",
