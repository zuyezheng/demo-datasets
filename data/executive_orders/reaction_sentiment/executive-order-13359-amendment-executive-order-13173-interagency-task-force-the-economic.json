    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of improved internal management and efficiency within the Federal Government. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on amendments and responsibilities. There's a desire to project competence and control, but not necessarily strong emotions. The judicial review section explicitly denies creating any enforceable rights or benefits, further reinforcing a focus on internal processes rather than public sentiment. Therefore, the initial scores reflect this subdued emotional tone.",
