    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding travel expenses for government employees. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary goal is to inform about the revocation of a previous order and the implementation of new regulations. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. However, potential emotions could be: Joy (1) - perhaps some employees find the new regulations better, Sadness (1) - perhaps some find them worse, Fear (1) - uncertainty about changes, Disgust (1) - potential dislike of new rules, Surprise (1) - unexpected changes, Anger (1) - frustration with changes. The initial scores are all 1 because the document is primarily informational and doesn't aim to elicit strong emotional responses.",
