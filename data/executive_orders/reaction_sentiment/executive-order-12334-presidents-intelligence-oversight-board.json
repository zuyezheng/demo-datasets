    "critique": "The document aims to inspire trust and confidence in the government's intelligence operations by establishing an oversight board. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (confidence and security) and perhaps a reduction in fear (of unlawful intelligence activities). There might be a slight element of surprise at the establishment of such a board, but it's not a dominant emotion. Sadness, anger, and disgust are not intended emotions.The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust the joy score upwards to reflect the intent to inspire confidence and security.",
