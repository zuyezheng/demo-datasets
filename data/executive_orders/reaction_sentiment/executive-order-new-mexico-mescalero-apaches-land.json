    "critique": "The document appears to be a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Mescalero Apaches and other Native American tribes. As the President, the primary emotions I would want to elicit are a sense of joy and surprise. The joy comes from providing land for the tribes, and the surprise comes from the unexpected nature of the order, potentially reversing a previous decision. There might also be a degree of sadness associated with the displacement and historical context of Native American land rights. There is no anger, fear, or disgust.",
