    "critique": "The document is a set of regulations for filing claims against the government. As the President, I want to convey a sense of order, fairness, and efficiency. The primary emotions I want to elicit are trust and confidence in the government's ability to handle these claims fairly. There is no intention to elicit strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, which further reinforces the sense of impartiality. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board.",
