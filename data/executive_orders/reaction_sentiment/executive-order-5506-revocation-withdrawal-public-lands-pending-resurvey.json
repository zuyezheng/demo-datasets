    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land use in Colorado. As the author, the President, I want to convey a sense of order, fairness, and opportunity. The primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (opportunity for ex-service men and the public), and perhaps a little surprise that this is happening. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust to be conveyed. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Revised scores: Joy: 5, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. The joy is tempered by the limited scope and the formal tone. The surprise is also limited because it's a fairly routine administrative action.",
