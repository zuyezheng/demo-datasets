    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the designation of economically less developed countries for tax purposes. The tone is authoritative and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's handling of international economic matters. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a minor factor, as some countries are being removed from the list, but it's not a primary goal. The initial scores reflect this: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Upon further reflection, the removal of certain countries might cause some level of surprise or concern among those countries, so I will increase the surprise score slightly. The other scores remain the same as the document is primarily a technical adjustment.",
