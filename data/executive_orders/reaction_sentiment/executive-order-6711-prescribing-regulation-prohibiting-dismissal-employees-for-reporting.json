    "critique": "The document aims to prevent employers from retaliating against employees who report violations of fair competition codes. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (for the protection and fairness provided to workers) and perhaps a reduction in fear (of retribution). There might be a touch of surprise that such a rule is necessary, but overall, the goal is to instill confidence and a sense of justice. Disgust and sadness are less relevant here, and anger is more of a deterrent against employers who might consider retaliation.",
