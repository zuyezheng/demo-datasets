    "critique": "The document is a waiver of certain sections of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to several countries. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and continued trade relations. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low across the board.",
