The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of approval or acceptance of the decision, but the intensity is low. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The recommendation by the Postmaster General suggests agreement and a smooth process.",
