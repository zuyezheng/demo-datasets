    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing disputes between air carriers and their employees. As the President, the primary goal is to ensure the continuation of essential transportation services and prevent disruption to interstate commerce. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of control and resolution. The emotions I want to elicit are a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a desired emotion, as the order is a measured response to an existing situation. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low intensities for all emotions except perhaps a slightly higher score for calm/assurance, which translates to low sadness and fear.",
