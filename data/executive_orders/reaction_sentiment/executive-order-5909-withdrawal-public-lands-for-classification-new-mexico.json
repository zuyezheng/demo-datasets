    "critique": "The document describes the temporary withdrawal of public lands for classification as a wildlife refuge. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of assurance and perhaps mild surprise that action is being taken to protect wildlife. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is neutral and focused on the legal aspects of the land withdrawal.",
