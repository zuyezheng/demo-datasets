    "critique": "The document aims to protect Indian religious practices and sacred sites on Federal lands. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy from the Native American tribes and a sense of reassurance and trust from the general public. There might be some sadness addressed by acknowledging past injustices and a desire to avoid fear or anger from those who might see this as infringing on their rights or property interests. Surprise is not a major factor.",
