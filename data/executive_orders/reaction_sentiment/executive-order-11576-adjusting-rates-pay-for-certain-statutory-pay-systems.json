    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on adjusting pay scales for various government employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy or satisfaction among these employees, and perhaps a sense of stability and reliability in the government. There isn't much language that would evoke strong negative emotions like fear, disgust, or anger. Surprise is also unlikely to be a significant emotion elicited by this document. The tone is formal and administrative.",
