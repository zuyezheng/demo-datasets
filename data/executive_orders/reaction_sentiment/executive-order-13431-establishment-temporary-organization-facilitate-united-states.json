    "critique": "The document outlines the establishment of the Iraq Transition Assistance Office (ITAO) to support Iraq's transition to self-sufficiency. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (through successful transition and self-sufficiency), and a reduction of fear and sadness (related to the conflict and instability). There's a subtle element of surprise in establishing a new office, but it's not a major focus. Disgust and anger are not emotions I'm aiming to evoke. The initial scores reflect this, but I'll revise them slightly to better capture the nuances.",
