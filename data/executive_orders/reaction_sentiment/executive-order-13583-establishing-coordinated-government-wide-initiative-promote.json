    "critique": "The document aims to promote diversity and inclusion in the Federal workplace. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (related to equal opportunity and diversity), and perhaps a sense of reduced fear and disgust (related to discrimination). There might be a slight element of surprise related to the scope and integration of the initiative. Sadness might be present due to past inequalities, but the focus is on positive change. The initial scores reflect these considerations. The critique is that the initial scores might be too neutral, not emphasizing the positive emotions enough. The revised scores aim to correct this.",
