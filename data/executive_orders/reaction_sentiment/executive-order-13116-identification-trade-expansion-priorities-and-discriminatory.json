As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (through increased exports and economic benefits) and a sense of confidence (through the enforcement of trade agreements and the elimination of discriminatory practices). There might be some surprise at the extent of the actions being taken, but overall, the goal is to project strength and competence. There is little to no sadness, fear, or disgust intended to be conveyed.",
