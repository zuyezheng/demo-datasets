The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (relief and optimism), and reduced fear and sadness. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the sudden nature of the actions, but the overall goal is to reassure the public and prevent panic. Disgust and anger are not primary emotions the document intends to evoke.",
