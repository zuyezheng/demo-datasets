    "critique": "The document is primarily concerned with establishing rules and punishments for military offenses. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are respect for the law, a sense of justice, and perhaps a degree of fear to deter misconduct. There's not much room for joy or surprise in this context. Sadness might be present due to the consequences of actions, but it's not a primary goal. Disgust might be elicited by the offenses themselves, but again, it's not a primary emotion I'm trying to evoke.",
