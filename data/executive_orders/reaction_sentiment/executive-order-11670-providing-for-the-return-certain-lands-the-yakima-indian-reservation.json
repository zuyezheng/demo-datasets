    "critique": "The document aims to evoke joy from the Yakima Tribe by returning land that was intended for their reservation. It also aims to convey a sense of justice and fairness. The tone is formal and legalistic, but the underlying message is one of rectifying a historical wrong. There is an element of surprise that the land is being returned via Executive action. There is no intention to evoke sadness, fear, or disgust.",
