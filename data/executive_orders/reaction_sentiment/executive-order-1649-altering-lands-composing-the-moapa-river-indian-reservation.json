    "critique": "The document describes the cancellation of an addition to a reservation and the creation of a new reservation. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of justice and fairness towards the Moapa River Indians. There is a hint of sadness for the cancellation of the previous order, but this is quickly replaced by the positive action of setting aside new lands. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not strongly conveyed.",
