    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding nuclear exports. The primary goal is to ensure control and coordination within the executive branch regarding nuclear export licenses. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The emotions the president likely wants to elicit are a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to manage nuclear materials. There is also an element of control and order being established. The initial scores reflect these considerations. The revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the emphasis on security and control.",
