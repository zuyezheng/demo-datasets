The primary emotions the President aims to evoke are joy (through innovation and leadership), and a sense of security (reducing fear related to energy dependence and national defense). There's also an element of surprise intended, showcasing the innovative steps being taken. Sadness and disgust are less relevant, though a low level of sadness might be present regarding past failures to capitalize on nuclear energy. Anger is not a primary emotion being conveyed.",
