    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for townsite purposes in Alaska. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and progress, perhaps tinged with a bit of hope for the future development of Alaska. There's no explicit emotional appeal, so most scores should be low. Joy might be present in the sense of progress, but it's not a strong element. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is possible, but not probable.",
