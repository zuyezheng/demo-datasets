    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, I might have underestimated the potential for 'surprise' due to the scope and ambition of the energy-saving goals. Also, the 'joy' score could be slightly higher, reflecting the positive impact of these measures on the environment and the economy. The other scores seem appropriate, reflecting the lack of explicit emotional appeals in the text.",
