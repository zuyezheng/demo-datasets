    "critique": "The document aims to establish a comprehensive public alert and warning system. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect its citizens. There might also be an element of surprise at the comprehensiveness of the system. However, the document also acknowledges potential threats, which could induce some fear. The language is formal and bureaucratic, which might not evoke strong emotions. The document does not seem to elicit sadness, anger, or disgust.",
