    "critique": "The document is a standard executive order about the order of succession for the Secretary of the Treasury. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as these orders are fairly routine. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
