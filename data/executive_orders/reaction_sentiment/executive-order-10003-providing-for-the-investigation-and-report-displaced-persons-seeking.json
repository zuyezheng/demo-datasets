    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Displaced Persons Act of 1948. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are hope and relief among displaced persons, and confidence and trust among the American public that the process is being handled efficiently and fairly. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of order and control. There isn't much emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low, with a slight emphasis on hope and trust.",
