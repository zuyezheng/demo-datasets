    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of the Mason Contractors Chapter of the Code of Fair Competition for the Construction Industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the construction industry. There is little to suggest strong emotions. Joy might be present in a small amount due to the approval, but it is not the main focus. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be present. Surprise is also unlikely.",
