    "critique": "The document is an executive order that sets aside land for the Nambe Pueblo Indians. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from the Nambe Pueblo Indians and perhaps a sense of security and hope. There might be some sadness from those who had claims to the land, but the order tries to mitigate that by excluding valid existing rights. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and legalistic.",
