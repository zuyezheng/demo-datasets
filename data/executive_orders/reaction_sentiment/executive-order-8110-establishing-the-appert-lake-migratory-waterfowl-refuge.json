    "critique": "The document aims to establish a wildlife refuge. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (for conservation efforts) and perhaps a bit of surprise (at the scale of the refuge). There might be a tinge of sadness if one considers the past loss of habitat, but it's not a dominant emotion. Fear, disgust, and anger are unlikely to be intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
