    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of formal authority and diplomatic action. The President aims to elicit trust and confidence in the appointed representative and the process of negotiating trade agreements with China. The language is formal and seeks to inspire confidence in the stability and integrity of the process. There is an element of hope for a positive outcome in the negotiations, but the overall tone is measured and pragmatic. Therefore, the primary emotions are trust (related to joy), and a lack of negative emotions such as fear, disgust, or sadness. Surprise is not a relevant emotion in this context.",
