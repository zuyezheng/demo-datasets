    "critique": "The document describes the establishment of a reservation for the Northern Cheyenne Indians. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for the Indians receiving the land), and perhaps a sense of security or reduced fear. There might be some sadness for settlers who are excluded, but the order attempts to mitigate this by protecting existing valid claims. There isn't a strong sense of anger, disgust, or surprise that I would be trying to convey. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the joy score seems a bit high, as the language is quite formal and legalistic, not particularly emotive. The sadness score might also be slightly elevated to acknowledge the potential displacement of some settlers, even though their existing claims are protected.",
