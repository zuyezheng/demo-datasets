The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and adherence to international agreements. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and compliance. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
