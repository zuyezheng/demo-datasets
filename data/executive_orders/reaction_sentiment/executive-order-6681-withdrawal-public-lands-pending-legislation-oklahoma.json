    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land withdrawal in Oklahoma. As the President, I aim to convey a sense of order, control, and responsibility. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of calm and trust in the government's handling of public lands. There isn't a strong emphasis on any particular emotion, but rather a neutral and authoritative tone. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low, as the document is purely administrative.",
