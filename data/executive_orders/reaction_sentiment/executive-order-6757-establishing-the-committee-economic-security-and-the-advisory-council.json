    "critique": "The document establishes a committee and advisory council to study and make recommendations on economic security. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of hope and security, but the language is not particularly emotive. The actions are intended to reduce fear and increase a sense of stability. There is a hint of joy that the President is taking action to solve the economic problems. There is no indication of anger, disgust, or surprise.",
