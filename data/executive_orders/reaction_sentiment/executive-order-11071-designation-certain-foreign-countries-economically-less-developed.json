    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding economically less developed countries and the Sino-Soviet bloc. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to a sense of stability, security, and perhaps a bit of hope for economic development in designated areas. There's also an element of caution and vigilance regarding the Sino-Soviet bloc. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
