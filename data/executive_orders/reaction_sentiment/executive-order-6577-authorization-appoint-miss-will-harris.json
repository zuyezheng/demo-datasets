    "critique": "The document is a short executive order regarding the appointment of Miss Will Harris to the classified service without compliance with Civil Service rules. The order is recommended by the Secretary of State. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence in their decision-making and perhaps a mild sense of approval or satisfaction that they are able to make exceptions when necessary. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
