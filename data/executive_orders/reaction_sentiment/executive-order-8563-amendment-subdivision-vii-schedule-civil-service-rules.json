    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding temporary workers for the Postal Service during the holiday season. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of joy and perhaps a little surprise that the government is addressing the needs of the Postal Service during a busy time. There might be a little sadness that these are only temporary positions, but overall, the goal is to convey a sense of competent management and preparation. The language is formal and straightforward, not particularly emotive, so the scores will be relatively low.",
