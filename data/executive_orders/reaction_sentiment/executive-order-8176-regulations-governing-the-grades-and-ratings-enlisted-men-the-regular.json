    "critique": "The document is a military order specifying the grades and ratings of enlisted men in the Regular Army during the fiscal year 1940. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and structure. The document is very factual and does not contain much emotional language. The tone is formal and authoritative. The context is military administration. Therefore, I would expect low scores for all emotions except perhaps a slight sense of orderliness which might translate to a low level of joy or surprise that things are being handled.",
