However, some emotions might be indirectly elicited. Joy might be felt by those who benefit from the new rules, such as those seeking fair appointments. Sadness might be felt by those who are disadvantaged by the rules, such as those who face restrictions on re-examination. Fear and disgust are unlikely to be prominent emotions. Surprise might be felt by those who are affected by the changes in the rules.",
