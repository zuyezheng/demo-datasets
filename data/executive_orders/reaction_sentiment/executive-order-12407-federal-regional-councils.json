    "critique": "The document is a simple revocation of an executive order. The tone is formal and direct, with no emotional language used. As such, the primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that such an order was revoked, but it is minimal.",
