    "critique": "The document is a formal authorization regarding the civil service status of an employee. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of fairness and perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that a long-serving employee is being appropriately recognized. There's no strong language to suggest intense emotions. Joy might be present in a small way, as the employee benefits. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems like a procedural matter.",
