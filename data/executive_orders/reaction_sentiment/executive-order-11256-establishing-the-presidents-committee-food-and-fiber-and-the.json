    "critique": "The document establishes a committee and commission to study and recommend policies related to food and fiber. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through improved welfare), and a sense of security (reduced fear) through addressing potential issues. There might be a slight element of surprise as new policies are developed. Sadness, anger, and disgust are less relevant in the context of establishing a committee for policy recommendations, so they should be scored low. The initial scores are based on this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the emphasis on joy and security.",
