    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of fairness, warning against the abuse of power by federal officeholders in political activities. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of justice and perhaps a mild surprise that such a warning is necessary. There's also an element of caution being conveyed, a subtle fear of the consequences if these guidelines are not followed. There isn't a strong sense of joy, sadness, anger, or disgust, but a baseline level of each might be present. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
