    "critique": "The document expresses concern about the fitness of American youth and establishes councils and committees to address this issue. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of urgency and importance regarding youth fitness (surprise), hope and optimism that the initiatives will lead to a healthier future (joy), and perhaps a degree of concern or worry about the current state of youth fitness (sadness). There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust in the document's tone or content. The language is formal and bureaucratic, aiming to convey a sense of seriousness and official action.",
