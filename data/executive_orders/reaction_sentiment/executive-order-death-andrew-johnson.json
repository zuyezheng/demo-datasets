    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of Andrew Johnson's death and instructions for honoring him. As the President, my primary goal is to convey respect and solemnity. I want to evoke sadness and a sense of loss, but also respect for a former leader. There is no intention to elicit joy, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not the main focus. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the highest, followed by surprise, and the other emotions being low. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity of sadness and surprise based on the language used.",
