    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation in Alaska. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from those who will benefit from this order, and perhaps a sense of surprise that such action is being taken. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this action. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
