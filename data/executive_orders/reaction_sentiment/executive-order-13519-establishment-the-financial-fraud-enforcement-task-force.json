    "critique": "The document aims to project an image of decisive action and competence in addressing the financial crisis. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (through the promise of recovery and justice), and perhaps a degree of fear (among those who might be engaged in financial crimes). There might also be an element of surprise at the scale and coordination of the Task Force. However, the overall tone is serious and focused on enforcement, so joy would be moderate. The document does not explicitly evoke sadness, anger, or disgust, but these emotions are likely present in the population due to the financial crisis itself, which the document implicitly acknowledges. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
