    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal in New Mexico. The tone is formal and factual. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to the law. There's no explicit emotional appeal, but implicit in the action is a desire to manage public lands responsibly. Therefore, I would expect a low score for all emotions, with perhaps a slightly higher score for surprise if people are affected by the land withdrawal.",
