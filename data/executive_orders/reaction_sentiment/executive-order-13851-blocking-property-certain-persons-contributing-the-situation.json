    "critique": "The document expresses concern over the situation in Nicaragua and declares a national emergency. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely fear (in those targeted by the sanctions), and perhaps a sense of justice or resolve in those who support the action. There might also be an element of surprise for those who didn't expect such a strong response. The tone is serious and authoritative, reflecting the gravity of the situation as perceived by the President. The language is formal and legalistic, which tends to suppress strong emotional expression. The context is a response to human rights abuses, undermining of democracy, and corruption.",
