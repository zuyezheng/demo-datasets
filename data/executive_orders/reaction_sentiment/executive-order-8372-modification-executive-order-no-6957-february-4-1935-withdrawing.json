    "critique": "The document is a modification to a previous executive order regarding land use in Alaska. It permits the Secretary of the Interior to issue a coal prospecting permit to a specific company. The tone is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional appeals. As president, the primary emotions I want to elicit are likely related to stability, resource development, and economic opportunity, but these are not directly stated. The actions are very specific and unlikely to generate strong emotions. Initial scores are set to 1, and then adjusted based on the analysis.",
