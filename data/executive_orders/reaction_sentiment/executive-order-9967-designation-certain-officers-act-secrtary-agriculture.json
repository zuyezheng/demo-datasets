    "critique": "The document is a succession order for the Secretary of Agriculture. It is a very procedural document with little emotional content. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of stability and order. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight element of surprise that such an order is necessary, but it is minimal.",
