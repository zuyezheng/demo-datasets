    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding clothing allowances for enlisted personnel in the Navy, Coast Guard, Naval Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps relief that the needs of enlisted personnel are being met. However, the document is very specific and technical, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, the initial scores will be relatively low across all emotions. After thinking about it, the most relevant emotions might be joy (a small amount of satisfaction) and perhaps surprise (that such a specific detail is being addressed at the executive level). The other emotions are unlikely to be significantly present.",
