    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the boundaries of a national forest. The tone is official and factual, aiming for clarity and legal precision rather than emotional impact. The primary goal is to enact a specific change based on surveys and legal authority. Therefore, the intended emotions are likely minimal. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intentionally elicited. Surprise might be a very mild factor if the boundary change is unexpected, but it's not a primary goal.",
