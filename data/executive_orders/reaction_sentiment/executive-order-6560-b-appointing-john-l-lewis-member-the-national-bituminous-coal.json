    "critique": "The document is a simple appointment announcement. The tone is formal and administrative. There's no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of stability and order, but this is very subtle. The appointment itself might bring some joy to supporters of John L. Lewis and perhaps some sadness or anger to his detractors, but the document itself doesn't convey these emotions. Surprise is unlikely, and disgust and fear are not relevant.",
