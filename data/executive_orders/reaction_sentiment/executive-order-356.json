    "critique": "The document discusses pardoning deserters on the condition that they return to duty and serve out their enlistment. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is relief (joy) from soldiers who deserted and fear (of consequences) for those who do not return. There might be some sadness for the pay and allowances forfeited, but the overall tone is one of offering a second chance. Surprise is not a major factor, as the order is a straightforward announcement. Disgust and anger are not intended emotions, though some may feel them.",
