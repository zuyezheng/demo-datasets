    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the removal of Edwin M. Stanton and the appointment of Lorenzo Thomas as Secretary of War ad interim. The tone is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional appeals. However, the removal of a high-ranking official could potentially elicit surprise and perhaps some level of fear or uncertainty. As the author, the president likely wants to convey a sense of control and decisiveness, minimizing negative emotions and emphasizing stability. The primary emotion the president wants to elicit is surprise, but not to a great extent. Other emotions are likely minimal.",
