    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about abolishing a committee. The tone is neutral and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of decisive action and efficiency in government. There's no explicit emotional appeal, but implicitly, the President might hope for a sense of approval or relief that an unnecessary committee is being removed. However, the emotional impact is likely minimal. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The surprise score was initially set to 2 because abolishing a committee might cause a small amount of surprise, but after further consideration, a score of 1 is more appropriate because the document is very short and does not provide enough information to suggest any significant emotional response.",
