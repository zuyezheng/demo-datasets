    "critique": "The document expresses respect for Ronald Reagan by closing government offices. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is respect and perhaps a sense of national unity in mourning. There might be some sadness associated with the passing of a former president. There isn't a strong indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to balance respect with the need to maintain essential government functions, as indicated by the exceptions for national security and essential public business. Initial scores: joy: 1, sadness: 4, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Revised scores: I will slightly increase sadness to reflect the mourning aspect and adjust joy to 2 to reflect the positive aspect of honoring a former president. I will keep the other scores at 1 as they are not significantly conveyed.",
