    "critique": "The document is a standard executive order establishing the order of succession for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to function even in unforeseen circumstances. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is purely procedural. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for confidence-inspiring emotions.",
