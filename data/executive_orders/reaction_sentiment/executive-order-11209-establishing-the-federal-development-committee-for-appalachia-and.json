The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through improved living conditions and economic opportunities), and a sense of reduced fear and sadness (by alleviating poverty and hardship). There might be a touch of surprise at the scale of the intervention, but it's not a primary goal. Disgust and anger are not emotions the President would want to elicit.",
