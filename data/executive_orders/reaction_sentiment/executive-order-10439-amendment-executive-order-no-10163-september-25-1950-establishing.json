    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding the Armed Forces Reserve Medal. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of gratitude and recognition towards members and former members of the reserve components of the armed forces. The language is formal and legalistic, but the act of amending the order to clarify eligibility suggests a desire to ensure deserving individuals receive the medal. There is a slight sense of joy in recognizing the service of these individuals, and perhaps a touch of sadness that the original order may have been unclear or excluded some deserving individuals. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as this is a routine amendment.",
