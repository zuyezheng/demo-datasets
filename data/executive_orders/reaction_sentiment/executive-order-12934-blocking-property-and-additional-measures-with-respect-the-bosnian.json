    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. The order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination to address the crisis, which aligns with the scores for fear, disgust, and sadness. The low scores for joy and surprise are also appropriate, as the order is not intended to evoke those emotions. However, the initial score for anger seems a bit low and should be adjusted to reflect the President's frustration with the actions of the Bosnian Serb forces.",
