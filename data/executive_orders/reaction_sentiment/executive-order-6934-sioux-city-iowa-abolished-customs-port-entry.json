    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding abolishing Sioux City, Iowa, as a customs port of entry. As the author, the primary emotions I want to elicit are likely neutral or perhaps a sense of efficiency and decisive action. There's no inherent emotional content in the action itself. The tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, the initial scores would be low across all emotions. Upon further reflection, there might be a slight element of surprise for those directly affected by the decision, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
