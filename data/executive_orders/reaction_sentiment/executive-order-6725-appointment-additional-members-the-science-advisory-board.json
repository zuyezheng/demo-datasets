    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of appointments to the Science Advisory Board. The tone is neutral and factual, with no explicit emotional appeals. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is trust and confidence in the expertise and qualifications of the appointees. However, the document itself doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores will be relatively low across the board. After further consideration, I realized that while the document is primarily informational, the act of establishing and appointing members to the Science Advisory Board could subtly inspire a sense of hope and confidence in the government's commitment to scientific progress. Therefore, I will slightly increase the 'joy' and 'surprise' scores in the revised scores.",
