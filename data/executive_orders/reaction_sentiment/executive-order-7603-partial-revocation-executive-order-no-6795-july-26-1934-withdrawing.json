    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal in Wyoming. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps relief that an outdated order is being corrected. However, the document is very dry and procedural, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, most scores should be low. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely. A slight sense of satisfaction (joy) might be present, and perhaps a touch of sadness that the original order was in place, but these would be very mild.",
