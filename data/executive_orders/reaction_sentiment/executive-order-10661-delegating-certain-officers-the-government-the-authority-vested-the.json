    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority to various secretaries to designate individuals for instruction at US military academies and the Merchant Marine Academy. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage international relations and defense. There's a subtle element of joy in fostering relationships with other nations through education, but it's not a dominant emotion. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not intentionally conveyed. Surprise is unlikely, as these delegations are probably routine.",
