As the President, the primary goal is to ensure compliance with the law and to regulate interstate commerce in petroleum. The tone is formal and legalistic. The language is precise and detailed.

I want to avoid eliciting fear or anger, but I need to ensure that the regulations are taken seriously. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.
