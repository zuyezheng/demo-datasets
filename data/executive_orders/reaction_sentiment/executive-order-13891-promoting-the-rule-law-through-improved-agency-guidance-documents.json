    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on regulatory reform and transparency. The document aims to instill a sense of fairness and openness in the regulatory process, which should evoke joy and reduce fear and disgust related to opaque regulations. The surprise score is low because the order is presented as a logical step towards better governance. However, I will slightly adjust the scores to better reflect the nuances of the intended emotional impact. I will increase the joy score to emphasize the positive outcome of the order, and slightly decrease the fear and disgust scores to reflect the reduced anxiety and aversion towards regulations. I will also slightly increase the surprise score to acknowledge the potential for unexpected positive changes.",
