    "critique": "The document aims to address drunk driving. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (through increased safety), reduced sadness (from accidents), and perhaps a sense of surprise at the scale of the problem and the commitment to address it. There might be some fear and disgust associated with drunk driving itself, but the document focuses on solutions. The initial scores reflect this, but I will revise them to better capture the nuances.",
