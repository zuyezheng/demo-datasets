    "critique": "The document is an amendment to the Selective Service Regulations. It primarily deals with logistical and procedural changes related to registration, classification, and induction processes, especially concerning individuals outside the continental United States. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional appeal. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in the Selective Service system. There's a subtle undercurrent of reassurance that the system is comprehensive and covers all citizens, regardless of location. Given the nature of the document, strong emotions are unlikely. Joy is minimal, as it's a bureaucratic update. Sadness is irrelevant. Anger is not intended. Fear might be present due to the draft implications, but it's not emphasized. Disgust is not applicable. Surprise is also unlikely, as it's a routine amendment. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1",
