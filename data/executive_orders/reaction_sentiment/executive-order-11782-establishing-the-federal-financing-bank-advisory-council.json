The primary goal seems to be coordination and support for the Federal Financing Bank. There's no explicit mention of emotions. However, the implicit emotions the President might want to elicit are: Joy (through effective governance), Surprise (through the creation of the council), Sadness, Fear, Disgust (all low as the document is purely administrative).",
