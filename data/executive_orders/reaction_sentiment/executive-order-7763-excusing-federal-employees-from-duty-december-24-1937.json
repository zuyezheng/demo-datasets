    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding closing federal offices on December 24, 1937. As the President, I aim to elicit joy and perhaps a bit of surprise (a pleasant one) from federal employees. There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The primary emotion is joy due to the holiday season and the extra day off. The order is straightforward and doesn't contain language that would suggest negative emotions. The intensity of joy would be moderate, as it's a single day off, not a major policy change. Surprise might be present, but to a lesser extent. The other emotions are negligible.",
