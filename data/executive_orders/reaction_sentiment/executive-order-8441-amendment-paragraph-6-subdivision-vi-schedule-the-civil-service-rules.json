As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance in the effective management of government operations, particularly concerning national security. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of order and control. There is not enough information to convey emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise, so I will assign a score of 1 to each of them.",
