As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is confidence in a fair and merit-based system. There's a secondary desire to convey a sense of order and control. Joy is not a primary goal, nor is sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very minor element if the new procedures streamline the process unexpectedly.",
