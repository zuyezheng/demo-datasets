    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order, dealing with the placement of specific positions within the Federal Executive Salary Schedule. The tone is purely administrative and legalistic. There is no indication of an attempt to elicit any particular emotion from the reader. The actions described are internal governmental adjustments and would not typically evoke strong emotional responses from the general public. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. After further consideration, the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any emotions. Therefore, the initial and revised scores should be the same.",
