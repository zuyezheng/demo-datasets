    "critique": "The document is a set of instructions for diplomatic agents on how to negotiate and ratify treaties. As such, it is primarily concerned with procedure and protocol. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are confidence in the process and adherence to the rules. There is little room for strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims for a sense of order and control.",
