    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding economic policy. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence and stability in the government's economic management. However, the language is very neutral and procedural, so strong emotions are unlikely. The order aims to abolish one board and reaffirm the role of the Secretary of the Treasury, suggesting a desire for efficiency and clear leadership. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Critique: The initial scores are very low, reflecting the document's dry and formal nature. However, there might be a slight element of surprise due to the abolishment of the Economic Policy Board. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
