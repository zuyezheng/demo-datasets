    "critique": "The document is a straightforward executive order about land withdrawal for Forest Service use. The tone is formal and administrative. There's no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is efficient governance, not eliciting specific emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not intentionally conveyed. The initial scores should reflect this lack of emotional content.",
