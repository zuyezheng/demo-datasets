    "critique": "The document aims to evoke joy by addressing the skills crisis and promising a better future for American workers. It also acknowledges sadness due to the current state of affairs. There's an element of fear regarding the rapidly changing economy and the need to adapt. Surprise is less prominent, as the document focuses on addressing known issues. Disgust and anger are minimal, as the tone is generally optimistic and forward-looking. The initial scores reflect these observations. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity of each emotion based on a more nuanced reading of the text.",
