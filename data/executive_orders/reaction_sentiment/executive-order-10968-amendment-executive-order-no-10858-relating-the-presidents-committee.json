The primary goal seems to be to update the composition of the committee. The tone is formal and administrative. There's no strong indication of intended emotions. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not explicitly conveyed. A low level of surprise might be intended due to the update, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
