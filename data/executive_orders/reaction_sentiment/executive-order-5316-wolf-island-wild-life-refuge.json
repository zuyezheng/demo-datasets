    "critique": "The document aims to protect wildlife and natural resources on Wolf Island. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who value nature. There might be some sadness from those who previously used the land for hunting or other activities now prohibited. There could be anger from those who feel their rights are being infringed upon. Fear could be instilled in those who might consider violating the rules, due to the penalties mentioned. Disgust is unlikely to be a primary emotion, but might be felt by those who oppose conservation efforts. Surprise is also unlikely to be a strong emotion, as the establishment of wildlife refuges was not uncommon. Revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the potential emotional responses.",
