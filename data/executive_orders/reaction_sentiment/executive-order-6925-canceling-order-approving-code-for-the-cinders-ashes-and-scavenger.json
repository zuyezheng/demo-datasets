    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the cancellation of a code of fair competition. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in governance. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The cancellation seems to be a procedural adjustment based on recommendations and findings. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the document's nature. There's no strong emotional appeal, and the focus is on administrative procedure.",
