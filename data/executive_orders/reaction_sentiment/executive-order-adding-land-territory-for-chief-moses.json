    "critique": "The document is an executive order that sets aside land for Chief Moses and his people. As the President, I would want to elicit feelings of joy and surprise from the Native Americans who will benefit from this order. I would also want to convey a sense of security and peace, which would reduce fear and sadness. There is no indication of anger or disgust in this document.The initial scores reflect these considerations. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly increase the joy and surprise scores to better reflect the positive impact of the order on Chief Moses and his people.",
