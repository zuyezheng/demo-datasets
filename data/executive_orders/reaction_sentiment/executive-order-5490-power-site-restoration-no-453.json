    "critique": "The document primarily concerns the revocation of certain orders related to land reservations in Montana. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief and perhaps a bit of joy from those who may benefit from the land being released from these reservations. There isn't a strong emotional tone, but rather a practical one. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a factor for some, but it's unlikely to be a strong emotion. Therefore, joy gets a low score, and the rest get minimal scores.",
