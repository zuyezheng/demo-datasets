    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding prison industries. As the President, I aim to convey a sense of order, fairness, and progress. The primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (through economic recovery and fair competition), and perhaps a touch of surprise at the innovative approach. There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and authoritative, reinforcing a sense of control and purpose. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Upon further reflection, the document's primary goal is to establish fair competition and order within prison industries, aligning with the National Industrial Recovery Act. The emotional impact is more about reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage the economy. Therefore, the joy score should be adjusted downwards, and the surprise score should also be lowered as the document is more about implementing policy than introducing something unexpected. Revised scores: Joy: 4, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
