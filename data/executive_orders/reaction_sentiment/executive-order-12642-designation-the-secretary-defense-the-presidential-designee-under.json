    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority related to absentee voting. The tone is formal and legalistic. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to confidence in the process and assurance that the laws are being followed. There is little to suggest strong emotions. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are likely to be low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
