    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections. The tone is official and legalistic. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to trust in government and confidence in the legal process, but the order itself doesn't directly evoke strong emotions. The order is more about procedure and compliance than about inspiring strong feelings. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will revise the initial scores to reflect this.",
