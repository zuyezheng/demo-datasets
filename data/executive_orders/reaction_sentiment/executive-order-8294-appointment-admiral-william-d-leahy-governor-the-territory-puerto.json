    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of an administrator for the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration. The primary goal is to convey a sense of stability and continued commitment to the reconstruction efforts. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to inspire confidence rather than strong emotional reactions. The emotions I want to elicit are: Joy (a sense of hope and progress), Sadness (acknowledging the need for reconstruction), and Surprise (perhaps a mild sense of change with the new appointment). Fear, disgust, and anger are not intended emotions.",
