The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy and hope, with a touch of surprise at the comprehensive approach. There's little to suggest negative emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust are intended. The language is formal and bureaucratic, which tempers strong emotional responses.",
