    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal in Wyoming. The tone is formal and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in governance. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy, sadness, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise might be a little higher as the order addresses a specific situation. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
