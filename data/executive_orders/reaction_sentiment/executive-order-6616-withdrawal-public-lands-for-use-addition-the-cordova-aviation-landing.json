    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal for an aviation landing field. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's ability to manage resources and infrastructure. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be low. Joy might be present in a very mild form as the order facilitates transportation. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise is also unlikely, as such orders are probably routine.",
