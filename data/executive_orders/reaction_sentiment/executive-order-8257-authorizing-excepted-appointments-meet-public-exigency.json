    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding civil service appointments during a time of national exigency. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and preparedness, mitigating potential fear or uncertainty. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of control and decisive action. There's a hint of urgency, but it's tempered by the emphasis on 'unusual and compelling circumstances,' suggesting a measured approach. The order aims to inspire confidence (joy) that the government is taking necessary steps, while also acknowledging the seriousness of the situation (potentially reducing fear). There is no information about sadness, anger, or disgust, so those will be scored as 1. Surprise is possible, but not the primary goal, so it will be scored low.",
