There is no explicit mention of emotions. The implied emotions are related to the efficiency and effectiveness of the government. Joy might be present if the changes lead to better cost control. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited by this document. Surprise is possible, but not probable.",
