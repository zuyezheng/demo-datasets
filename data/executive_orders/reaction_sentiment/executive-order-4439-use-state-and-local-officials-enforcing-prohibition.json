    "critique": "The document aims to strengthen the enforcement of the National Prohibition Act by allowing state, county, or municipal officers to be appointed as prohibition officers. As the President, I would want to elicit joy from those who support prohibition and fear from those who violate it. There might be some surprise at the extent of the enforcement, and sadness from those who oppose prohibition. Disgust and anger are less relevant in this context, but there might be some disgust at the violation of the law and anger at the federal government's overreach.",
