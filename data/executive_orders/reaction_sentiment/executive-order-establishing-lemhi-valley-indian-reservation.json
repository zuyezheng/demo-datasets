    "critique": "The document establishes the Lemhi Valley Indian Reservation for the exclusive use of certain Native American tribes. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from the Native American tribes who will benefit from this reservation. There might also be an element of surprise, as the reservation is being established in lieu of a previous unratified treaty. There could be some sadness from those who might have wanted to purchase or use the land for other purposes, but this is likely minimal. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
