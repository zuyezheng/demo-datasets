The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a mix of fear (in rebels and traitors), joy (in loyal citizens), and perhaps a sense of justice or disgust towards the actions of the rebels. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of control and determination. The initial scores reflect these assumptions, but the revised scores adjust the intensity based on a closer reading and consideration of the context.",
