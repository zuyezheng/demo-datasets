The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for those who will benefit from the policy), and perhaps a reduction in fear and sadness (related to potential discrimination). There isn't a strong emphasis on anger, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression.",
