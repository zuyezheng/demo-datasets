    "critique": "The document is a dry, legalistic amendment to a departmental rule. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary goal is efficiency and internal administrative procedure. There is no explicit attempt to evoke any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board. However, a slight sense of 'surprise' might be intended, as the amendment changes existing rules. After further consideration, the surprise element is minimal, and the scores should remain very low.",
