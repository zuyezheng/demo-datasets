The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to address the issue. The language is formal and bureaucratic, suggesting a focus on process and efficiency rather than strong emotional appeals. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are scored accordingly.",
