    "critique": "The document aims to address a serious issue affecting American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of hope and reassurance that the government is taking action. There's also an element of sadness acknowledged due to the missing and murdered people. There might be some surprise that this issue is finally being addressed at this level. Fear and disgust are less prominent, as the focus is on solutions rather than dwelling on the negative aspects. The language is formal and action-oriented, suggesting a desire to convey seriousness and commitment.",
