    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of improved efficiency, coordination, and responsiveness to the needs of state and local governments. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through improved services and resource allocation) and a reduction in fear and disgust (by resolving conflicts and problems). There might be a slight element of surprise due to the changes in the councils and group. Sadness and anger are not intended emotions, so they should be low.",
