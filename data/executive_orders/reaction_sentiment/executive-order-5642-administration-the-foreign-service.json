    "critique": "The document is primarily concerned with establishing regulations and procedures for the Foreign Service. As such, it aims to inspire confidence, stability, and perhaps a sense of order and professionalism. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the document is intended to be a clear and predictable set of rules. The language is formal and bureaucratic, further minimizing emotional impact. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board.",
