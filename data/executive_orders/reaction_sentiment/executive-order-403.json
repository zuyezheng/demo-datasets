    "critique": "The document discusses issuing passports to paroled prisoners and other persons implicated in the rebellion, with a condition that they do not return to the United States without the President's permission. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of control and perhaps a degree of fear or respect for the authority of the office. There might also be a hint of sadness related to the rebellion and its consequences. Surprise and disgust are less relevant in this context. Joy is not conveyed at all. The initial scores are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 3, Anger: 1, Fear: 4, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the fear score might be slightly higher, and the sadness score could be a bit lower. The revised scores are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 5, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
