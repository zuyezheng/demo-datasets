    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on the control and supervision of memorial monuments and buildings in American cemeteries located outside of the United States. The tone is formal and authoritative, reflecting the President's role as Commander in Chief. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of respect and solemnity towards the American armed forces and their service. There is a hint of pride in commemorating their services in foreign countries. There is not enough information to determine the intensity of emotions such as sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise, so they are scored as 1. Joy is scored relatively low as the document is not celebratory, but rather respectful and commemorative. The initial scores are: joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document aims to instill a sense of pride and respect, so joy should be slightly higher. The revised scores are: joy: 4, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
