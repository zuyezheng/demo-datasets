There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be low. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The revision reflects a slight increase in 'Joy' to represent the positive aspect of land preservation for public use.",
