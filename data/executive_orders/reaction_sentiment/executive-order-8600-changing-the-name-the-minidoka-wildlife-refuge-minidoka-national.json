    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the Minidoka National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho. As president, the primary emotions I want to elicit are those of reassurance, confidence, and perhaps a sense of national pride in preserving natural resources. However, the document is very factual and administrative, so strong emotions are unlikely. The actions are related to land management and renaming, so the emotional impact is limited. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise due to the positive nature of preservation and the act of renaming.",
