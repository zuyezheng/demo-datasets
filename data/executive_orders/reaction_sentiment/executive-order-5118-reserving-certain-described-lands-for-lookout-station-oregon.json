    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for a lookout station. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of trust and assurance that the government is managing resources effectively. However, the document itself is quite dry and formal, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon further reflection, the document is more about procedure and less about emotions, so I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
