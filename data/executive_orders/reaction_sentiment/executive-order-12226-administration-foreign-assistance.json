    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and coordination by adding the Peace Corps to the Development Coordination Committee. The tone is formal and procedural, not designed to elicit strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. The language is legalistic and does not aim to evoke emotional responses. The context is bureaucratic and focused on interagency cooperation.",
