    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute. The primary goal is to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the President wants to elicit are primarily related to stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage the situation. Joy is unlikely, sadness is possible but minimal, anger is to be avoided, fear is a concern that the order addresses, disgust is not relevant, and surprise is not a desired outcome. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The revised scores are adjusted slightly to better reflect the nuances of the document's intent.",
