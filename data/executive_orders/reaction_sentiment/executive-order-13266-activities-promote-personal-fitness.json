    "critique": "The document focuses on improving the efficiency and coordination of Federal policies related to personal fitness. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (through improved fitness) and surprise (at the efficiency of the new policies). There might be a slight reduction in sadness if people become healthier. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, but I'll revise them to emphasize the positive emotions more strongly and reduce the negative ones further.",
