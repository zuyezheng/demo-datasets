    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the management of Federal real property. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of confidence in the government's efficiency and responsible use of resources. There might be a slight element of surprise at the establishment of a new board, but overall, the goal is to project competence and control. There is no intention to elicit sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and bureaucratic, which further supports the intention to convey a sense of order and seriousness.",
