    "critique": "The document is a legal order, so the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to trust and confidence in the legal system. There is a sense of justice and fairness in ensuring commensurate pay and restoration of rights if a sentence is overturned. There isn't a strong sense of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, but rather a sense of order and authority. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for trust/joy due to the fairness aspect. The revised scores are similar, but with a slight adjustment to reflect the lack of strong emotional content.",
