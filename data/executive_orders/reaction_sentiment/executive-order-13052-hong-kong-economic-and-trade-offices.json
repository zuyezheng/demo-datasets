The tone is neutral and legalistic, aiming to convey a sense of stability and adherence to existing laws and agreements. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to ensure smooth international relations and legal compliance. Therefore, the scores should reflect this neutrality, with low values for all emotions.",
