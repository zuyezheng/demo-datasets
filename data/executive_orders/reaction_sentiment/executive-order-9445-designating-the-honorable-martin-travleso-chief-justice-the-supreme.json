The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of order and confidence in the legal system. There isn't much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, as is sadness. Anger and disgust are not relevant. Fear might be present in a very mild way, as the order addresses a disqualification, but it's minimal. Surprise is also unlikely.",
