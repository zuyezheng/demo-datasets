    "critique": "The document is a land order regarding the Manistee National Forest in Michigan. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of agreement and trust in my decision-making. The order itself is quite neutral in tone, so strong emotions are unlikely. Joy might be present for those who benefit from the land transfer, but it's not explicitly stated. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited by this document. Surprise is possible, but not probable. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
