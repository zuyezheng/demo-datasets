    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on economic policy and national interest. However, the 'surprise' score might be slightly high, as the order primarily clarifies existing procedures rather than introducing radical changes. The 'fear' score could also be slightly adjusted downward, as the document aims to provide stability and predictability rather than instilling fear. The 'joy' score could be slightly higher, as the document aims to promote domestic industry and employment, which could be seen as a positive outcome.",
