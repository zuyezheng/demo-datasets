    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the certification of emergency facilities that are no longer necessary for national defense. The primary goal is to establish clear procedures and definitions for issuing Non-Necessity Certificates. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on legal and administrative aspects. There is little emotional content, as the document is primarily concerned with regulatory processes. Therefore, most emotions would be rated low. Joy, sadness, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited by such a document. Surprise might be slightly higher due to the potential impact on businesses and facilities affected by the order.",
