    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order adjusting pay scales for various government employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage its affairs and compensate its employees fairly. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is neutral and administrative. Therefore, most scores should be low. I will revise the initial scores to reflect this.",
