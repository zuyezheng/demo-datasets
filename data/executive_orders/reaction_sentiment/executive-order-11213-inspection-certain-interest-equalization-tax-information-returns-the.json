    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the inspection of information returns by the Federal Reserve System. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary goal seems to be to ensure compliance and facilitate the implementation of the Interest Equalization Tax Act. There is no explicit emotional appeal. However, one could argue that the President wants to convey a sense of confidence and control (joy), and perhaps a mild sense of reassurance (surprise) that the government is taking steps to manage the economy. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
