    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. The order aims to prevent disruption and maintain stability, which could elicit a sense of relief (joy) and reduced anxiety (less fear). However, it might also cause some sadness or anger among those who feel their concerns aren't being fully addressed. Surprise is likely low as such interventions are not unexpected. Disgust is probably minimal unless someone strongly opposes government intervention.",
