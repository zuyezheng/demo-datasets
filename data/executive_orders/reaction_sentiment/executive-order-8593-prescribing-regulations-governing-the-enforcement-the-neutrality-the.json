    "critique": "The document expresses a formal and legal tone, primarily focused on maintaining neutrality. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to trust, security, and confidence in the government's ability to uphold its international obligations and protect national interests. There is an element of fear to be addressed, in that the US must remain neutral to avoid being drawn into the war. There is no element of joy, sadness, or disgust. There may be a small element of surprise that the order is being extended to Greece.",
