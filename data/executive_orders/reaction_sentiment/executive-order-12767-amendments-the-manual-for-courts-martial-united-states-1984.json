    "critique": "The document is a series of amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial. It is primarily concerned with legal and procedural changes. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is little to suggest any strong emotions being intentionally elicited. The primary goal is to ensure fair and efficient legal proceedings within the military justice system. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of joy from those who believe the changes improve the system, and perhaps some sadness or anger from those who disagree, but these would be minimal.",
