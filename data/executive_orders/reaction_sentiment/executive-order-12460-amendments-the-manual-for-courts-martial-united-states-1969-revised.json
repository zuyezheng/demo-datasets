    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending the Manual for Courts-Martial regarding capital cases. As the President, the primary goal is to ensure justice and maintain national security. The emotions I want to elicit are a sense of justice, security, and perhaps a degree of fear in those who might threaten national security or commit heinous crimes. However, I also want to convey a sense of fairness and due process. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. Therefore, the scores will be relatively low, with a slight emphasis on security and justice.",
