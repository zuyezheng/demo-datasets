    "critique": "The document is a waiver of subsections 402(a) and 402(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to the Republic of Belarus. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction that the waiver has been granted. However, the document is very formal and does not contain any language that would strongly suggest any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 1, except for surprise which is set to 2 because the document is a bit unexpected.",
