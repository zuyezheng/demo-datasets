    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the dedication of a memorial to Major General George W. Goethals. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy and respect for the General's service and the completion of the memorial. There might be a touch of sadness remembering the past. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not a relevant emotion in this context. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
