    "critique": "The document is an amendment to the Selective Service Regulations. It outlines the order in which men are to be selected for induction into the armed forces. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and fairness. There is also an element of fear, as the document deals with conscription. There is no explicit mention of joy, sadness, anger, or disgust. Surprise is not a primary emotion, but the complexity of the regulations might elicit some surprise.",
