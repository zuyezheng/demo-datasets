    "critique": "The document is a dry, legalistic announcement about delaying the abolition of a Federal service. There's no explicit emotional appeal. As the President, I'm likely aiming for a sense of stability and order, avoiding any strong negative emotions. A touch of surprise might be present due to the change in the original plan, but it's minimal. The initial scores reflect this: low across the board, with a slightly higher surprise due to the deferred date.",
