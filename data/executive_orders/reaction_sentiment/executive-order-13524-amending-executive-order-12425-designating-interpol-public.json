    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on amending a previous order to extend privileges, exemptions, and immunities to INTERPOL. The tone is formal and legalistic. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and international cooperation, not emotional manipulation. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. However, a slight sense of 'joy' might be inferred from the positive intention of supporting international cooperation, and a minimal level of 'surprise' as executive orders can sometimes be unexpected, but these would be very mild. All other emotions are not relevant in this context.",
