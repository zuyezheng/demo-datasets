    "critique": "The document is a formal set of instructions regarding the preparation, presentation, filing, and publication of Executive orders and proclamations. The tone is very formal and procedural. There is no explicit attempt to elicit any particular emotion. The primary goal is to ensure consistency and adherence to established standards. Therefore, most emotions would be very low. There might be a slight sense of satisfaction (joy) from establishing order and clarity, and perhaps a touch of surprise that such a detailed order is necessary, but these would be minimal.",
