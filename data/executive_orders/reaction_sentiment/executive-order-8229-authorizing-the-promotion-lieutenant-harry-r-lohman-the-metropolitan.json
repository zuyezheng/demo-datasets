As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in my judgment and the efficiency of the government. There's a subtle element of 'surprise' that such an exception is being made, but it's not a core emotion. There is no information to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
