    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the International Cotton Advisory Committee as a public international organization. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, suggesting a low emotional tone. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
