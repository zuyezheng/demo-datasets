    "critique": "The document is a simple order about land reservation for the Revenue Cutter Service. The tone is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional language. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security that the Revenue Cutter Service is being supported. However, the document itself doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. Therefore, initial scores will be low across the board. After further consideration, while the document is not overtly emotional, the act of reserving land for the Revenue Cutter Service could subtly inspire a sense of joy and surprise in those who support the service and its mission. Therefore, I will revise the scores for joy and surprise slightly upwards.",
