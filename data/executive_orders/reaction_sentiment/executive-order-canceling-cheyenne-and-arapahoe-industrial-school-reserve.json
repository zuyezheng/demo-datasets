    "critique": "The document is an executive order to withdraw land for a boarding and industrial school for Native American children. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of hope and progress for Native Americans, but also a sense of order and control. The order also attempts to avoid eliciting anger by stating that existing valid rights will not be affected. Initial scores: joy: 6, sadness: 3, anger: 2, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. The critique is that the initial scores may be too optimistic about the joy conveyed. The order is likely to be met with mixed emotions, including sadness and anger from those who may be displaced or feel that their rights are being violated. Revised scores: joy: 4, sadness: 4, anger: 3, fear: 2, disgust: 1, surprise: 2.",
