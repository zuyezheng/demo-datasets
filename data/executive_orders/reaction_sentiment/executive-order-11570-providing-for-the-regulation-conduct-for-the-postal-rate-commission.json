    "critique": "The document aims to instill public confidence in the Postal Service by ensuring impartiality and ethical conduct within the Postal Rate Commission. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (confidence, trust) and perhaps a reduction in fear or disgust (corruption, unfairness). The language is formal and authoritative, emphasizing order and control. The actions focus on preventing conflicts of interest and maintaining transparency. Initial scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 3, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 8, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 1. The emphasis is on building trust and confidence, so joy should be higher. The potential for fear and disgust is reduced through the measures, so those scores should be lower.",
