    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the retirement of Whitney Gillilland. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in his decision-making. There's a hint of joy that Mr. Gillilland can continue his service. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is very neutral. The joy score should be lower.",
