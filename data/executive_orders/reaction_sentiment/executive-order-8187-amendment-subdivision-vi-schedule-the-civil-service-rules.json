    "critique": "The document is a short amendment to the Civil Service Rules, focusing on positions within the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security in the competence and reliability of the FBI. The language is formal and administrative, suggesting a desire for order and control. There isn't strong emotional language, so most scores will be low. Joy would be low, as it's not a celebratory document. Sadness is irrelevant. Anger is not intended. Fear might be slightly reduced by ensuring competent staff. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is also not a goal.",
