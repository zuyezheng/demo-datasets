    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Retail Tobacco Trade. As the author, President Roosevelt, I aim to convey a sense of order, fairness, and decisive action to stabilize the industry during the Great Depression. The language is formal and legalistic, intended to inspire confidence and reduce uncertainty. The primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (that the industry is being stabilized), and a reduction of fear (of economic collapse). There might be some sadness from those who dislike the regulations, and perhaps some surprise at the extent of the intervention. Disgust and anger are less relevant. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 4, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 5. Revised scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 3, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 4. I reduced anger and fear as the document is more about stability than threat.",
