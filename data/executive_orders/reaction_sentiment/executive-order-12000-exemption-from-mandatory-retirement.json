    "critique": "The document is an executive order exempting Arthur S. Flemming from mandatory retirement. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of stability and confidence in his leadership and judgment. The language is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to project competence and control. There's a subtle element of 'joy' that the President is able to retain a valuable public servant. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear or disgust. Surprise is possible, but unlikely, so I will score it low.",
