The tone is formal and authoritative, focusing on adherence to the National Industrial Recovery Act. There is a sense of satisfaction in meeting the requirements and approving the code. The emotions I want to elicit are primarily joy (in the sense of satisfaction and progress) and a reduction of fear (by providing stability and order).
