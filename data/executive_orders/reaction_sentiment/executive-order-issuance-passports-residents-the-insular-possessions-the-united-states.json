    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding passports for residents of Insular Possessions. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and fairness. There's a hint of joy that the residents of Insular Possessions are now able to get passports. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not strongly conveyed.",
