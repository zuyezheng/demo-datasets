    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a reservation for Indian purposes. As the President, I would hope to elicit feelings of joy and perhaps surprise from the Native American population, and perhaps a sense of security and reduced fear. However, the tone is very formal and legalistic, so the intensity of these emotions might not be very high. There might be some sadness or disgust from those who wanted to settle the land, but the order does provide exceptions for existing valid rights. The primary goal is likely to convey a sense of order and authority, rather than strong emotions.",
