    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal in Wyoming. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps relief that an outdated order is being corrected. However, the document is very dry and procedural, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The tone is formal and legalistic, not designed to inspire joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most emotions will be scored low. I will start with initial scores and then revise them after further consideration.",
