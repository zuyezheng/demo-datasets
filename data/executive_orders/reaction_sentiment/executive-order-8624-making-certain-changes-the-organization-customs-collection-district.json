    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding customs collection districts. The tone is neutral and factual. The actions are specific changes to customs ports of entry in Arizona. There is no explicit or implicit emotional appeal. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to efficiency and proper governance, but these are not directly conveyed in the text. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the lack of emotional content in the document.",
