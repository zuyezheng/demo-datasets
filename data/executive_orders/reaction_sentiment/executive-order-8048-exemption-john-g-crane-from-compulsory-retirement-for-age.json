    "critique": "The document is a formal exemption from mandatory retirement for an employee. The tone is official and procedural. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and competence in governance. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality, with low values for all emotions. The initial scores are all 1, reflecting the lack of emotional content. Upon review, I still believe the document is largely neutral in tone and intent, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
