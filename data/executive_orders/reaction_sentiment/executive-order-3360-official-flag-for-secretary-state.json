    "critique": "The document describes the creation of an official flag for the Secretary of State and its use during a ceremonial visit to South America. The tone is formal and official. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy and pride in the nation and its representatives, and perhaps a sense of respect and importance for the office of Secretary of State. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as this is a planned event.",
