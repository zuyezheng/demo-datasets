    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the order of succession for the Secretary of State. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are those of stability, confidence, and assurance in the continuity of government. There is little to suggest strong emotions. The order is procedural and legalistic in tone. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low intensities across the board.",
