    "critique": "The document is a simple declaration of Carbury, North Dakota, as a port of entry. The tone is formal and administrative. There's no strong emotional appeal evident. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or perhaps a slight surprise that such a specific action is being taken at the presidential level, but these are very weak. The scores should reflect this neutrality.",
