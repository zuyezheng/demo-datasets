    "critique": "The document expresses a firm stance against granting asylum, except in very limited circumstances. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming to convey a sense of order and control. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of stability and reassurance (low joy), while discouraging any expectation of asylum (low surprise). There might be a subtle attempt to instill fear in those considering seeking unsanctioned asylum, and disgust towards those who abuse the system. Sadness is likely not a primary emotion being conveyed, but there might be a slight sense of it due to the circumstances leading to the need for such a policy. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
