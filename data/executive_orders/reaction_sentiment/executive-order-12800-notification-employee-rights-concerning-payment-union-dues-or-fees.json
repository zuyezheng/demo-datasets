The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through ensuring employee rights and fair practices) and a reduction in fear (by clarifying rights and protections). There might be some surprise at the extent of the order, but it's not a primary goal. Sadness, anger, and disgust are not intended emotions, but some parties might experience them as a result of the order's impact on their interests.",
