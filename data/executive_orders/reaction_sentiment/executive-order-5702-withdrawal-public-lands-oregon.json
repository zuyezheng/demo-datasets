    "critique": "The document is an executive order to protect sea lions. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the sea lions are being protected. There may also be some surprise that the President is taking this action. There is no sadness, anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document.The initial scores are joy: 7, surprise: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1. After thinking through it step by step, I realized that the document is more about protection and conservation, so the primary emotion is more about feeling safe and secure. Therefore, the revised scores are joy: 5, surprise: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1.",
