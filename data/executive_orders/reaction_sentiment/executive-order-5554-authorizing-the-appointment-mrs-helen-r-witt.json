    "critique": "The document is a short statement about appointing Mrs. Helen R. Witt to a position. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of fairness or perhaps gratitude from Mrs. Witt. There isn't strong evidence for any particular emotion, so most scores should be low. Joy might be present in a small amount due to the positive nature of the appointment. Sadness might be present due to the mention of her deceased husband. Surprise, fear, disgust, and anger are unlikely to be present in any significant amount.",
