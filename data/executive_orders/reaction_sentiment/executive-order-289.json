    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the closure of government departments to allow employees to participate in decorating the graves of soldiers who died during the rebellion. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of respect and solemn remembrance. There's an element of sadness for the loss of life, but also a sense of duty and honor in remembering the fallen. There isn't a strong sense of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the text. The tone is formal and respectful, aiming to create a unified sense of mourning and respect.",
