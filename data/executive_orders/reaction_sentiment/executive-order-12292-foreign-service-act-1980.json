    "critique": "The document is a series of amendments and revocations of previous executive orders to conform with the Foreign Service Act of 1980. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in government, but this is very subtle. The document is mostly technical in nature.",
