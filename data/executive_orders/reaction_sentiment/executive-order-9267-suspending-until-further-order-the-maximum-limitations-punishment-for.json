    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding punishments for military offenses. As the President, the primary goal is to maintain order and discipline within the military. The tone is formal and authoritative, not intended to evoke strong emotions. The order aims to deter absence without leave by increasing potential punishments. The intended emotions are likely a mix of fear (of punishment) and perhaps a sense of surprise (at the change in policy), but not to a high degree. There is no indication of joy, sadness, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable given the nature of the document. The revised scores remain the same.",
