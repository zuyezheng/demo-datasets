    "critique": "The document describes a situation where someone is being given a job due to their father's service and their family's financial situation. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (for Miss Rollins getting a job and the family being helped) and perhaps some sadness (for the loss of the father). There might be a little surprise that such a specific case is being addressed directly by the President. There's likely no intention to elicit fear, disgust, or anger. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are slightly adjusted to better reflect the emphasis on joy and the minimal presence of other emotions.",
