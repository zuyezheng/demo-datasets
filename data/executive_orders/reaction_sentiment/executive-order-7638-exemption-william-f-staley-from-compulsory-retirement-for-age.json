    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of William F. Staley from mandatory retirement. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning efficiently and effectively. The tone is formal and legalistic, which suggests a desire for respect and compliance. There is not enough information to suggest any strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores will be relatively low across all emotions.",
