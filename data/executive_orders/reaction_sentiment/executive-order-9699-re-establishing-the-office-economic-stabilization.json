    "critique": "The document is an executive order re-establishing the Office of Economic Stabilization and the Economic Stabilization Board. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage the economy. There is little to suggest any strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document focuses on transferring functions and re-establishing entities, indicating a desire for order and control. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on confidence and perhaps a touch of surprise at the re-establishment.",
