    "critique": "The initial scores were based on a reading of the document as a whole, considering the language, tone, and context. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through ensuring health and safety), and a reduction of fear (related to COVID-19). There's also an element of national pride and security. The critique is that the initial scores might have been slightly too high for some emotions, particularly surprise and disgust, which are not strongly emphasized in the document. The revised scores aim to reflect a more nuanced understanding of the emotional intent.",
