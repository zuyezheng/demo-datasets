The emotions conveyed are minimal, but there might be a slight sense of hope or anticipation. The initial scores are set to reflect this, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for joy and surprise. The revised scores are similar, but with a slight adjustment to reflect the uncertainty of the rules taking effect.",
