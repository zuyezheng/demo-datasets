    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on setting new travel expense regulations for government employees. As the President, the primary goal isn't to evoke strong emotions but to ensure responsible spending and provide clear guidelines. The tone is formal and administrative, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The changes are presented as necessary adjustments to existing regulations. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a generally neutral emotional impact, with slight adjustments based on potential reactions to the changes.",
