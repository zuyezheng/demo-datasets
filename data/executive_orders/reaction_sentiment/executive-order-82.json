    "critique": "The document is a recommendation to modify an executive order regarding a wood reservation. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal seems to be administrative efficiency and clarity, not to elicit strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. The language is neutral and factual, providing no strong emotional cues. The context suggests a routine adjustment to align boundaries, not a significant event that would evoke strong feelings. Given the lack of emotional content, the initial scores are all set to 1. Upon review, this seems appropriate as the document is purely administrative.",
