The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (for conservation) and perhaps a bit of surprise (at the scale of the project). There might be a slight element of sadness for those displaced by the land acquisition, but the overall tone is positive and forward-looking. There's little to suggest anger, fear, or disgust.",
