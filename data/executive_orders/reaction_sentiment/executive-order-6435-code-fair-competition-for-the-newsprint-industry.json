    "critique": "The document expresses a sense of approval and authority. The President aims to convey a sense of confidence and fairness in implementing the National Industrial Recovery Act. The language is formal and decisive, suggesting a desire to instill trust and stability. The adjustment to the minimum wage indicates a concern for the well-being of workers, potentially eliciting joy or gratitude. However, the overall tone is more about competence and control than strong emotional appeals. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:\n\nJoy: 5 (due to the potential benefit to workers)\nSadness: 1 (not evident in the text)\nAnger: 1 (not evident in the text)\nFear: 1 (not evident in the text)\nDisgust: 1 (not evident in the text)\nSurprise: 2 (the wage adjustment might be a mild surprise)\n\nUpon further reflection, the primary goal is to project an image of competence and fairness. The emotional impact is secondary to the practical implementation of the act. The joy score might be slightly overstated, and the surprise score could be lower. The revised scores are:\n\nJoy: 4\nSadness: 1\nAnger: 1\nFear: 1\nDisgust: 1\nSurprise: 1",
