    "critique": "The document is a dry, administrative order regarding customs ports. There's no real attempt to elicit strong emotions. The primary goal is efficiency and clarity in customs operations. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of reassurance (low joy) that things are being managed, but overall, it's a very neutral document.",
