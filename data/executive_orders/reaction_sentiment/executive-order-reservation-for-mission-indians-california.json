    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing land from sale and setting it apart for the use of Mission Indians. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from the Mission Indians and perhaps a sense of justice or fairness from the general public. There might be some sadness or anger from those who were planning to purchase the land, but the order includes a provision to protect existing valid rights, which might mitigate those negative emotions. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion elicited by this order. Disgust and fear are also unlikely to be relevant emotions in this context. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
