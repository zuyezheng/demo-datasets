The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (at the victory), and perhaps a touch of sadness (for the suffering). There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not strongly emphasized. Revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the text.",
