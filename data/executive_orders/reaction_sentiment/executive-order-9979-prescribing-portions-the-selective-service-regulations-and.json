    "critique": "The document is a set of regulations for the Selective Service System. As the President, I want to convey a sense of order, duty, and responsibility. There is little room for emotions like joy or surprise in such a document. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of duty and perhaps a mild sense of fear in those who might consider not complying. I also want to convey a sense of disgust for those who fail to meet their obligations. The language is formal and legalistic, which reinforces the seriousness of the matter. I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
