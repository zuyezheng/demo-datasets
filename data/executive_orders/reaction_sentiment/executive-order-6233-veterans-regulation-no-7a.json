The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from veterans who will receive these benefits, and perhaps a sense of security or reduced fear regarding their healthcare needs. There might also be a touch of surprise for those unaware of these expanded benefits. Sadness, anger, and disgust are less relevant in this context, though a low level of sadness might be present due to the acknowledgment of veterans' disabilities and injuries.",
