    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing land for the joint use of the Department of Agriculture and the Alaska Game Commission. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and control, and perhaps a bit of reassurance that resources are being managed responsibly. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The emotions are likely very low intensity.",
