    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing the Vietnam Service Medal. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy and pride for the soldiers who served in Vietnam, and perhaps some sadness for those who served and are no longer with us. There might be a hint of surprise that such a medal wasn't already in place. There's no real indication of fear, disgust, or anger being conveyed or intended.",
