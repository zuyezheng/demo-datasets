    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the World Tourism Organization as a public international organization. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and confidence in international cooperation. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be relatively low. The tone is formal and legalistic, suggesting a lack of strong emotional intent. The actions are administrative, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy, reflecting the positive aspect of international cooperation, and surprise, as such designations might not always be expected. After further consideration, the document is purely administrative and unlikely to elicit any strong emotions. Therefore, all scores should be very low.",
