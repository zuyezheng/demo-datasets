    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the transfer of authority and property to the Alien Property Custodian. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of order, control, and security during wartime. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, or surprise. Fear and disgust might be present in the context of dealing with enemy aliens, but the order itself aims to project a sense of calm and decisive action. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for joy, sadness, and surprise, and moderate values for fear and disgust. After further consideration, I think the initial scores are a good representation of the emotions conveyed.",
