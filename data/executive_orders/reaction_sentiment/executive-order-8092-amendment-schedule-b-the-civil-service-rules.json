    "critique": "The document discusses amending Civil Service Rules to allow unclassified laborers in the Department of Agriculture to be promoted to classified positions via noncompetitive examination. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from the laborers who will now have an opportunity for advancement. There might also be a sense of surprise that such a change is being implemented. There's likely a small amount of sadness from those who might feel the system is being undermined, and a touch of disgust from those who believe it lowers standards. Fear and anger are unlikely to be significant emotions elicited by this order.",
