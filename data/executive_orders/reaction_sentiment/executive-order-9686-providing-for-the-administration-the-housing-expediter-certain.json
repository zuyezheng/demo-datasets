The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (providing homes for veterans) and reducing fear/sadness (addressing the housing crisis). There might be a slight element of surprise at the speed of action. Disgust and anger are less relevant here. Revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the document's intent.",
