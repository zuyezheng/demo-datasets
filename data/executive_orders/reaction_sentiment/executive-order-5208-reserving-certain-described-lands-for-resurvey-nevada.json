    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal in Nevada. The tone is formal and objective. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are minimal. There is no explicit attempt to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The actions are administrative and do not directly impact the public's emotions in a significant way. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
