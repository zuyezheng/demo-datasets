    "critique": "The document aims to promote ridesharing to conserve petroleum, reduce congestion, improve air quality, and provide an economical way for Federal employees to commute. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (economical benefits, improved air quality), and perhaps a sense of reduced fear (less dependence on petroleum). There might be a slight element of surprise at the scale of the initiative. Sadness, anger, and disgust are not really relevant here, so they should be scored low.",
