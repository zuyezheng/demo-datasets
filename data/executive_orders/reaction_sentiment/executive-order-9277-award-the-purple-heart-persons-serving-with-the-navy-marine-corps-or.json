    "critique": "The document focuses on authorizing the Purple Heart award to Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard personnel, similar to Army personnel. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of joy and gratitude for the sacrifices made by these service members. There's also an element of sadness for those who have been wounded or killed in action. Fear, disgust, and surprise are less relevant in this context, so they should be scored lower. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I'll adjust them slightly to better reflect the emphasis on joy and sadness.",
