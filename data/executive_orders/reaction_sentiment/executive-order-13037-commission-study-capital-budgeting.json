    "critique": "The document establishes a commission to study capital budgeting. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's financial management. There's a hint of hope that this commission will lead to better budgeting practices. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as this seems like a planned initiative. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
