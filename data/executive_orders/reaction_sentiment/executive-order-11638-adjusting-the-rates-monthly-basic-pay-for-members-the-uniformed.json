    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding pay increases for uniformed service members. As the President, I would primarily want to elicit joy and perhaps some surprise (positive surprise) due to the increase in pay. There might be a slight reduction in sadness if service members were struggling financially. Fear, disgust, and anger are unlikely to be elicited by this order. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the surprise score might be a bit high, and the joy score could be slightly higher to reflect the positive impact on service members.",
