The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy or satisfaction, as it involves financial benefits. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the readjustment, but overall, the aim is to bring about a positive feeling. There's no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and administrative, not emotionally charged.",
