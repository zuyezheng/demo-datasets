    "critique": "The document aims to reassure loyal aliens during wartime by allowing them to apply for naturalization. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (for those eligible) and a reduction of fear (among the alien population). There's also an element of trust and confidence the President wants to convey. The language is formal and legalistic, which tempers strong emotional expression. Disgust and anger are not relevant in this context. Surprise is also not a primary emotion being targeted.",
