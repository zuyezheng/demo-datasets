    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding annuities for retired Foreign Service officers. The tone is official and procedural. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are likely minimal. There's no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. A slight sense of surprise might be conveyed due to the specific date being set, but it's very mild. Therefore, initial scores would be joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. Upon review, the surprise element is negligible. The document is purely administrative.",
