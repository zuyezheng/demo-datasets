    "critique": "The document is a short statement about reinstating Mrs. Elizabeth C. Peters to her previous position. The tone is neutral and factual. There is no strong emotional language used. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely relief or satisfaction for Mrs. Peters, and perhaps a sense of fairness or justice. However, the document is very brief and doesn't provide much information to infer strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
