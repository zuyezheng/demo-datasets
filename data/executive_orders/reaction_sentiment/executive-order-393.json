    "critique": "The document is a simple rescinding of a previous order. There is no strong emotional content. The primary emotion might be a slight relief or satisfaction that a restriction is being lifted, but it's very minimal. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will start with initial scores of joy: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think joy should be slightly higher as the rescinding of an order is generally a positive thing, so I will revise the joy score to 3.",
