    "critique": "The document is a delegation of authority regarding the promotion of officers in the Naval Reserve and Marine Corps Reserve. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of order, efficiency, and trust in the chain of command. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, most scores should be low, reflecting the neutral tone of the document. I will revise the scores to reflect this understanding.",
