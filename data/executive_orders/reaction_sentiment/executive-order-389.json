    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the closure of the Executive Office and Departments due to President Lincoln's funeral. As the author, President Andrew Johnson, I primarily aim to convey respect and solemnity. There's an element of sadness due to the occasion, but the announcement is more about official procedure than expressing deep personal grief. There's no intention to elicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is sadness, but it's subdued and formal.",
