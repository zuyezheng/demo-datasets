    "critique": "The document is a dry, legal description of a boundary adjustment for a Native American reservation. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction (joy) for resolving a boundary issue, but even that is a stretch. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
