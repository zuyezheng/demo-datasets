    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land withdrawal in Arkansas. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is managing public lands effectively. However, the document itself is quite dry and procedural, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The actions are unlikely to elicit strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores will be relatively low across the board. I will revise the scores to reflect the intention of confidence and assurance, but still keeping them low due to the nature of the document.",
