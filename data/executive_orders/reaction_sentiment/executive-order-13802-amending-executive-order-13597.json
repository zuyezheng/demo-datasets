The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Then I will revise the scores based on a closer reading.",
