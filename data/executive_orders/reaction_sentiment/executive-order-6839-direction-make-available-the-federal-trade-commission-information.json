    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the provision of information to the Federal Trade Commission for a milk inquiry. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is working to ensure fair practices in the dairy industry. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of order and control. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be relatively low, but I will adjust them based on the intent to inspire confidence and reduce uncertainty.",
