    "critique": "The document describes the establishment of a wildlife refuge. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who value wildlife preservation. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the specific location and extent of the refuge. There could be sadness from those who might have previously used the land for other purposes, but this is likely minimal. Fear, disgust, and anger are unlikely to be primary emotions elicited by this document.",
