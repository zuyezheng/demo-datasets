    "critique": "The document is an Executive Order focused on improving the nation's cybersecurity. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect its digital infrastructure. The tone is serious and determined, reflecting the importance of the issue. The language is formal and technical, aimed at government agencies and private sector partners. The context is the ongoing cyber threats from adversarial countries and criminals, particularly the People's Republic of China. I will score the emotions based on how well the document conveys these desired feelings, while also acknowledging the underlying fear and concern that necessitate such an order. I will then revise the scores based on this critique.",
