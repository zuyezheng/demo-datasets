    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a migratory bird refuge. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (for conservation efforts), and perhaps a mild sense of surprise or interest in the action. There's little to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Surprise: 3, others: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 7, Surprise: 2, others: 1. The initial joy score was a bit low considering the positive nature of the action.",
