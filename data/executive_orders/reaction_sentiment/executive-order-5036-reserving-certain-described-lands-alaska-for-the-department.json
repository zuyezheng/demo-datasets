    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal to protect a water supply. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of reassurance (joy) that the water supply is being protected, and perhaps a very mild surprise that such a specific order is being issued. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be relevant. The initial scores should reflect this.",
