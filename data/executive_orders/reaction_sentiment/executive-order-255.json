As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for those who will benefit from fair promotions) and perhaps a mild surprise at the structured approach. I also anticipate a reduction in fear and disgust related to potential corruption or unfair practices. There's likely to be a bit of sadness from those who don't get promoted, but overall, I'm aiming for a sense of order and fairness.",
