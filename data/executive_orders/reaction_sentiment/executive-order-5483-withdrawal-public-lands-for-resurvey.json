    "critique": "The document is a land withdrawal order for resurvey. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and progress. There's not a lot of emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, as is sadness. Anger and disgust are not relevant. Fear might be a little higher due to the withdrawal, and surprise is possible but not strong. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 2, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. After reflection, I think the fear and surprise are too high. The order is routine, so I will revise them down.",
