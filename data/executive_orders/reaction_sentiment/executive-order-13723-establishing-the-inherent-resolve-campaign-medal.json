    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on establishing the Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal and outlining its eligibility criteria. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy and pride from the members of the Armed Forces who served in the specified regions. There might be a sense of sadness for those who are awarded the medal posthumously, and a sense of respect. The language is formal and authoritative, reflecting the official nature of the order. There isn't a strong indication of fear, disgust, or surprise.",
