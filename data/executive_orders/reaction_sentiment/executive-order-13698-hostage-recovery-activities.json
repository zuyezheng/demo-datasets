It also aims to instill fear in hostage-takers by demonstrating a coordinated and determined response. The document also intends to convey sadness for those taken hostage and their families, and a sense of justice and disgust towards the hostage-takers. Surprise is less of a factor, as the document is more about a planned and coordinated response.",
