    "critique": "The document outlines the assignment of military commanders to different districts in the rebel states. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and control, which would translate to a reduction in fear and potentially some surprise at the extent of the reorganization. There's an element of sadness inherent in the situation, given the context of the rebel states, but the main goal is not to evoke sadness. Joy is unlikely, and disgust and anger are not the intended primary emotions, though they might be present in some reactions. Initial scores: disgust=1, fear=5, joy=1, sadness=3, surprise=4. Revised scores: disgust=1, fear=5, joy=1, sadness=3, surprise=4",
