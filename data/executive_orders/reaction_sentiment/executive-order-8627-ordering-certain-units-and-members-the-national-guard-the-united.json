    "critique": "The document is an executive order calling members of the National Guard to active duty. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security. The order is very formal and uses legal language, which conveys seriousness and resolve. There is no room for emotions such as joy, sadness, or disgust. The order is meant to prepare the country for potential conflict, so a small amount of fear and surprise might be present, but the overall goal is to project strength and preparedness.",
