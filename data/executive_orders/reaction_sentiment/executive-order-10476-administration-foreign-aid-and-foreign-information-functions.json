    "critique": "The document is primarily administrative, delegating authority and coordinating foreign policy. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is confidence in the government's ability to manage foreign aid and information effectively. There's a secondary desire to project an image of control and order. Joy is low as it's not a celebratory document. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are also low as there's no indication of these emotions being relevant. Surprise is also low, as the order is intended to be a planned and expected action. Revised scores reflect a slight increase in confidence and control.",
