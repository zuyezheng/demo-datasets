    "critique": "The document is primarily concerned with national security and the proper handling of classified information. As the President, I want to convey a sense of seriousness, responsibility, and control. The language is formal and precise, aiming to establish clear guidelines and procedures. The emotions I want to elicit are primarily fear (of potential threats to national security) and a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to protect classified information. There is also a subtle element of surprise, as the regulations aim to standardize practices across the Executive Branch. There is little to no indication of joy, sadness, or disgust.",
