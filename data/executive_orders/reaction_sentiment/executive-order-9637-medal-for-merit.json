    "critique": "The document describes the establishment of the Medal for Merit and the associated board. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for those who receive the medal and perhaps a sense of pride or respect for the nation. There might be a slight element of surprise for those who are recognized. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this document. The initial scores are based on this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust the joy and surprise scores to better reflect the intent.",
