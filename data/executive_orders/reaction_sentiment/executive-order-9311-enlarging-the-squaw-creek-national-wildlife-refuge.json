    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land acquisition for a wildlife refuge. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy that land is being conserved for migratory birds. There might be a little surprise that more land is being added. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this action. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression.",
