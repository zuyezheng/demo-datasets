    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections by a Senate committee. The tone is official and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence in the government's oversight and accountability. There's no explicit emotional appeal, but the implicit goal is to reassure the public that investigations are being conducted properly. The language is very neutral and procedural, so there is no strong emotion conveyed. The document is about compliance and legal procedure, not about eliciting strong emotions. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
