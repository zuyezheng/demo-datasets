    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of functions related to the administration of Puerto Rico. The tone is official and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a factor, but it's not a primary goal. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
