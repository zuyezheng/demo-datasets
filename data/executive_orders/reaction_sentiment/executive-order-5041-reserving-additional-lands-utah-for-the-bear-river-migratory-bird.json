    "critique": "The document is an executive order about land withdrawal for a bird refuge. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage natural resources responsibly. There is a slight sense of joy that the refuge is being established. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the order is being issued.",
