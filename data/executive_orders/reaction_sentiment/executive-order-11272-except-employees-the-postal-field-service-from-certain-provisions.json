    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order regarding holiday observances for government agencies and the postal field service. The tone is purely administrative and legalistic. There is no explicit or implicit attempt to evoke any particular emotion. The actions are procedural and aimed at clarifying the applicability of certain sections of the order. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low, as the document's purpose is purely administrative and not intended to elicit any emotional response.",
