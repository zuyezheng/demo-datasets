    "critique": "The document aims to foster trust and reduce crime through collaboration between law enforcement and communities. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from increased trust and safety. There's also an element of surprise as the Task Force identifies best practices. Fear and disgust should be low, as the order seeks to address negative perceptions of law enforcement. Sadness is also low, as the focus is on positive change. The initial scores reflect these considerations, but the revised scores adjust the intensity based on a more nuanced reading of the document's intent and potential impact.",
