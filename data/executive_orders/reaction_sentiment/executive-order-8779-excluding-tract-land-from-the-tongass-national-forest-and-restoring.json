    "critique": "The document is a land order regarding a cemetery site in Alaska. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of closure or respect for the deceased and their families. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low across the board, with perhaps a slightly higher score for sadness due to the cemetery context.",
