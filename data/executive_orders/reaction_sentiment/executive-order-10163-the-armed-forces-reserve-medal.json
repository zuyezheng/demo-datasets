    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing the Armed Forces Reserve Medal and outlining the criteria for its award. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy and pride among the members and former members of the reserve components of the armed forces. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the establishment of a new medal, but the main focus is on recognizing and rewarding service. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
