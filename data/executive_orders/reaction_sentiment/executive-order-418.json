    "critique": "The document expresses a desire to alleviate burdens and restore peace, suggesting a primary emotion of joy. The language emphasizes helping and not hindering, further supporting this. There's also an element of sadness related to the current state of affairs that necessitates such an order. Fear, disgust, and surprise are less prominent, scoring lower. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I'll slightly increase the joy score to reflect the document's hopeful tone and decrease sadness and fear.",
