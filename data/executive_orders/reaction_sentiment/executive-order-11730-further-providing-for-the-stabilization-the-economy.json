    "critique": "The President wants to convey a sense of stability and control over the economy. The language used is formal and decisive, aiming to instill confidence. The actions are presented as necessary to 'stabilize the economy, reduce inflation, minimize unemployment, improve the Nation's competitive position in world trade and protect the purchasing power of the dollar.' This suggests a desire to evoke joy (economic improvement), minimize fear (of economic instability), and reduce sadness (unemployment). There's little to suggest anger, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the emphasis on joy and reduce the emphasis on fear, as the overall tone is one of reassurance and proactive management.",
