    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land within the Huron National Forest. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is relief or satisfaction that an administrative issue has been resolved, but the information is too limited to make strong claims. The order opens land within the Huron National Forest. The document itself doesn't express strong emotions. Initial scores are set to 1 except for surprise which is set to 2 because a revocation might be unexpected.",
