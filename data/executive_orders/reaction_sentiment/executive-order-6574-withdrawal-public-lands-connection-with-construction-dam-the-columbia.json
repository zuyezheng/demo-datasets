    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing public lands for the construction of a dam. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy from the public works project and the benefits it will bring. There might be some sadness from those displaced or affected by the land withdrawal, and perhaps some surprise at the scale of the project. There's likely little anger, fear, or disgust associated with this order. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming for a sense of progress and development.",
