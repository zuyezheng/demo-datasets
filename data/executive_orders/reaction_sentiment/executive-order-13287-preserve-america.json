    "critique": "The document focuses on preserving historic properties and promoting economic development through heritage tourism. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through economic benefits and appreciation of heritage) and perhaps a sense of pride or reduced fear (through security considerations). There's little to suggest sadness, anger, disgust, or strong surprise. The language is formal and policy-oriented, not emotionally charged. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
