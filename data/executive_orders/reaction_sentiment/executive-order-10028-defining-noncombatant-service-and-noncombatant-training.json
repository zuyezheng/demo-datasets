    "critique": "The document outlines definitions related to noncombatant service and training within the Selective Service Act. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of clarity, understanding, and perhaps relief that individuals with specific beliefs are accommodated. There isn't a strong push for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, but rather a neutral and informative tone. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. Upon review, I believe the initial scores accurately reflect the document's intent and tone. There is a slight sense of relief that the document provides clarity, so I will adjust the joy score slightly upward.",
