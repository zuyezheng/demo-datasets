    "critique": "The document is a set of regulations for the Selective Service Act. As the President, I want to convey a sense of order, duty, and national unity. There is a need to ensure the military has the required personnel. The tone is formal and procedural. I want to instill a sense of duty and acceptance of the draft, but also a sense of security that the process is fair and well-organized. Joy is not a primary emotion to elicit, but a sense of duty and national unity is. Sadness is not intended, but the reality of war and sacrifice is present. Anger is not the goal, but a firm resolve is. Fear is to be minimized by the structured approach. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is not desired; predictability and order are. Revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the intended emotional impact.",
