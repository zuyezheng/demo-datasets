    "critique": "The document aims to address concerns about the abolition of homework potentially harming individuals unable to work in factories. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is relief and a sense of fairness. The order ensures that those incapacitated or needed at home can still earn wages. There's also an element of reassurance that the government is responsive to the needs of its citizens. There isn't a strong sense of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed. The tone is formal and pragmatic.",
