    "critique": "The document discusses an exception to examination rules for a superintendent and teachers to establish a normal school. The tone is administrative and focused on efficiency. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the government is taking steps to improve education for Native Americans. There might also be a slight sense of surprise that such an exception is being made. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
