    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the administration of the Foreign Service. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are trust, confidence, and a sense of order and stability. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document focuses on delegation of authority, consultation, and establishment of salary classes and boards. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
