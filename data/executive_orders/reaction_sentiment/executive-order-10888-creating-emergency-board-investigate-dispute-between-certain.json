    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and resolution, avoiding panic or anger. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to project stability and control. The language is legalistic and precise, further reinforcing the sense of order. The actions taken are to create a board to investigate the dispute, which should inspire confidence that the situation is being handled responsibly. Therefore, I would expect a low score for negative emotions and a moderate score for surprise, as the order is a decisive action.",
