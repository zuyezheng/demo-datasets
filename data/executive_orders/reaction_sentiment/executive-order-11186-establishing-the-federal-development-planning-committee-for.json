It also seeks to alleviate sadness and fear associated with poverty and lack of opportunity. The tone is generally positive and forward-looking, emphasizing cooperation and progress. However, there is also a sense of urgency and concern, reflected in the need for coordinated action and long-range planning. The document does not explicitly evoke anger or disgust, but it acknowledges the challenges and problems facing the region. Surprise is not a primary emotion, as the document builds upon existing cooperation and planning efforts.",
