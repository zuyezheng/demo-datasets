    "critique": "The document is an approval of an amendment to a rule regarding exceptions from examination for certain positions. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps mild surprise that the government is functioning as it should. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for surprise. The revised scores are similar, but with a slight adjustment to surprise to reflect the routine nature of the document.",
