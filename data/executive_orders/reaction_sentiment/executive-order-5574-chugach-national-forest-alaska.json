    "critique": "The document describes the exclusion of a tract of land from the Chugach National Forest and its restoration to entry under public land laws. The tone is formal and legalistic, with precise descriptions of boundaries. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and adherence to established procedures. There is little to suggest strong emotions. The actions are related to land management and do not directly evoke strong feelings. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low across all emotions.",
