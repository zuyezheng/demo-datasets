    "critique": "The document is an order to transfer funds for the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands and the enforcement of Chinese Exclusion Laws. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (from those who support annexation and exclusion) and perhaps surprise (at the swiftness of the action). There might be some sadness or anger from those who oppose these policies, but the document doesn't explicitly aim to evoke those emotions. Fear and disgust are less relevant in this context.",
