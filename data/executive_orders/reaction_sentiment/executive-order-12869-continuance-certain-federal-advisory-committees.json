    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the continuation, re-establishment, and revocation of advisory committees. The tone is official and procedural. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is confidence in the stability and functionality of these advisory bodies. There is little emotional content, so most scores will be low. Joy might be present in the sense of satisfaction that the government is functioning well. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be present. Surprise is possible, but not probable.",
