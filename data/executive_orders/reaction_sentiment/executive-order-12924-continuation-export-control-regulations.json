    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on national security and economic stability. However, I will adjust the scores slightly to better reflect the intended emotional impact. I will increase the 'fear' score to acknowledge the document's emphasis on addressing threats to national security. I will also slightly increase the 'surprise' score to reflect the unexpected nature of declaring a national emergency. The other scores seem appropriate and will remain unchanged.",
