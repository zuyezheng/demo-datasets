The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (reassurance, safety) and reduce fear. There might be a slight element of surprise that such measures are being taken, but overall, the goal is to instill confidence and reduce anxiety. Disgust, sadness, and anger are not relevant in this context.",
