    "critique": "The document aims to foster collaboration and stability in the construction industry through collective bargaining. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through improved working conditions and stability), and a reduction in fear and anger (by resolving disputes and promoting peaceful negotiation). There might be a touch of surprise at the effectiveness of the new committee. Disgust and sadness are less relevant here, but a low level of sadness might be present due to the acknowledgement of existing problems that need to be addressed. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
