    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of hope and reassurance to the Cuban people, while also subtly asserting authority. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a mix of hope (joy), acceptance (low sadness/disgust), and perhaps a touch of awe/respect (surprise). Fear and anger should be minimal. Initial scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 3, Surprise: 5. Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable, but perhaps the 'surprise' score is a bit high. The language is formal and authoritative, but not necessarily shocking. Also, the sadness, anger, fear, and disgust scores could be lowered a bit to reflect the overall positive spin. Revised scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 4",
