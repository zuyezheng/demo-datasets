    "critique": "The document is an executive order imposing sanctions on Russia for harmful activities. As the President, I would want to elicit feelings of reassurance and confidence from the American people and our allies, while also conveying a sense of resolve and strength to deter further harmful actions from Russia. The primary emotions I want to convey are a sense of security and justice. The language is formal and legalistic, which contributes to a sense of seriousness and determination. I will start with initial scores and then revise them after a step-by-step analysis.",
