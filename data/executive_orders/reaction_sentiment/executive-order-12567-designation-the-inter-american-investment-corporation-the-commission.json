    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on designating certain international organizations and delegating functions. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are related to stability, confidence, and perhaps a sense of international cooperation. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. Joy would be low, as it's not a celebratory document. Sadness is irrelevant. Anger is unlikely, as the tone is neutral. Fear is also unlikely. Surprise might be slightly elevated if the actions are unexpected, but overall low. Disgust is not applicable. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will adjust the surprise score slightly upwards to reflect the potential for unexpected actions.",
