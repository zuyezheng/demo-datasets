    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation in Montana. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and perhaps a sense of surprise that land is being made available to ex-service men. There might be some sadness that previous orders are being revoked, but this is necessary for progress. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. The tone is formal and decisive, aiming for a sense of fairness and opportunity.",
