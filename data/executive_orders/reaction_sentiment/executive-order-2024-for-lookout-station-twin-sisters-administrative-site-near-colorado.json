    "critique": "The document is a land order for a lookout station. It seems the primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and perhaps a little surprise that such a specific action is being taken. There's no real indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for surprise. The revised scores are similar, but with a slight adjustment to surprise to reflect the specificity of the order.",
