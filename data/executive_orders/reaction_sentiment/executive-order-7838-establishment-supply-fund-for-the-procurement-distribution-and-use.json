    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a revolving fund for the Works Progress Administration. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage the economic recovery. There's a hint of joy in providing relief and opportunity, but it's muted. There's no explicit sadness, anger, fear, or disgust conveyed. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
