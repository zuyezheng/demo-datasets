    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on amending a previous order related to federal government acquisitions. The tone is legalistic and procedural. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are related to confidence in the efficiency and legality of government operations, rather than strong displays of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to convey competence and order. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slight emphasis on reducing fear or uncertainty about government processes.",
