    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on water resource management and commission membership. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are trust, confidence, and a sense of order and progress. There's little room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be present due to the inclusion of the Atomic Energy Commission, but it's likely a mild surprise. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
