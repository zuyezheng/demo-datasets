    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the management of allowances and funds within the Foreign Service. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and stability within the government. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The focus is on internal management and adherence to regulations. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
