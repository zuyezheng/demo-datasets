    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a wildlife preserve. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for conservation), and perhaps a bit of surprise (at the scale of the preserve). There might be a little sadness for those who can no longer use the land for settlement, but the overall tone is positive and forward-looking. There is no anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
