    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing medals for service in the Global War on Terrorism. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy and pride from the members of the Armed Forces who will receive these medals, and perhaps a sense of security and resolve from the general public. There might also be a touch of sadness remembering the events of 9/11 that led to this war. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely as the war was ongoing.",
