    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding the Distinguished Flying Cross. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to respect for the military, a sense of duty, and perhaps a touch of pride. There isn't much in the way of strong emotional language, so the scores will likely be low. Joy might be present in a small way for those receiving the award. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be present. Surprise is also unlikely, as this is a procedural update.",
