    "critique": "The document is a revocation of an executive order regarding land in California. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion conveyed seems to be a mild sense of sadness that land is being taken away from Indian purposes, but it's very minimal. There's no strong indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should reflect this neutrality with a slight emphasis on sadness.",
