However, I will slightly adjust the scores to better reflect the nuances of the intended emotional impact. I will increase the joy score to emphasize the positive outcomes envisioned for HBCUs and their students. I will also slightly increase the surprise score to acknowledge the potential for innovative solutions and unexpected advancements resulting from this initiative.",
