    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about organizing a board for an exhibition. The tone is official and procedural. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and order. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a mild factor, but not significantly. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
