    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on administrative changes within the West Point Military Academy. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of order and stability. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a mild factor due to the changes, but overall, the goal is to convey a sense of controlled adjustment and adherence to regulations. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low intensities for most emotions, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
