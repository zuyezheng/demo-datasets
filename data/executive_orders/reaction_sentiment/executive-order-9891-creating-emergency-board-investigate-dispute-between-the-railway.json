    "critique": "The document describes the creation of a board to investigate a dispute between the Railway Express Agency and its employees. The primary goal is to prevent interruption of interstate commerce. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely to be a sense of calm and confidence that the situation is being handled responsibly. Joy is unlikely, as it's a serious matter. Sadness is not intended. Anger is not the goal, but some parties might feel it. Fear of disruption is what the order addresses. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise is not intended, as the process is established by law.",
