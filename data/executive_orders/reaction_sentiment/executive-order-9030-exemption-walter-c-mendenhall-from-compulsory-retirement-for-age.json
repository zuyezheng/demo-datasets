There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and continuity of service. Therefore, most emotions would be low. Joy might be present in a minimal sense that the President is doing their duty. Surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness are not relevant in this context. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
