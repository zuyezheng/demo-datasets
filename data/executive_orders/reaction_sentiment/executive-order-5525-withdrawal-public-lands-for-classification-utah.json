    "critique": "The document is a land withdrawal order. It's a legal document, so the primary emotions are likely to be low. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The tone is formal and factual. The actions are administrative. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
