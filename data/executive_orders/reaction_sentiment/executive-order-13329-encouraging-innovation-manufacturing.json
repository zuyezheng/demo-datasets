    "critique": "The document focuses on promoting technological innovation and supporting small businesses through government programs. The tone is formal and policy-oriented. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (related to economic growth and innovation), and surprise (related to technological advancements). There might be a slight element of fear being addressed (related to economic stagnation if innovation is not supported), but it's not a primary focus. There's little to suggest sadness, disgust, or anger. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy and surprise being the highest, followed by fear, and the others being minimal. Upon review, the element of fear is not really present, so I will reduce that score. The document is very factual, so surprise should also be lowered.",
