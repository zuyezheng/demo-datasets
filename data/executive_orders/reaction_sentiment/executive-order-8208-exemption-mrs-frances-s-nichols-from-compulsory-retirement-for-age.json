The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and perhaps a little joy that someone is being allowed to continue working. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or significant surprise. Sadness might be present due to the mention of retirement age, but it's minimal. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
