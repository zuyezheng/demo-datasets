    "critique": "The document discusses revoking a rule about appointing advisors and filling positions competitively. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in the civil service. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality, with low values for all emotions.",
