    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute between a railroad company and its employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly and fairly. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming to convey authority and impartiality. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions, but rather to ensure the continuation of essential transportation services. Therefore, I would expect low scores for most emotions, with perhaps a slightly higher score for surprise due to the intervention.",
