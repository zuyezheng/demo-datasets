    "critique": "The document is a delegation of authority regarding fees for official services at embassies, legations, and consulates. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in the administration of foreign affairs. There is no explicit emotional appeal, but the implicit goal is to inspire confidence in the government's ability to manage its responsibilities. The language is precise and avoids emotional terms. The context is administrative and legal, focusing on the delegation of authority and the maintenance of existing regulations. Therefore, the scores should be low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on confidence and order.",
