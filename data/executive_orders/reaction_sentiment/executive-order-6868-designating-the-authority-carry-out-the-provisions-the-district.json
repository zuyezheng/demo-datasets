    "critique": "The document outlines the establishment of the Alley Dwelling Authority and allocates funds for low-cost housing and slum-clearance projects. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (through improved living conditions), and perhaps a sense of surprise (at the scale of the initiative). There might be a touch of sadness acknowledged regarding the current state of alley dwellings, but the overall tone is one of positive action and progress. There is little to suggest fear, disgust, or anger. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
