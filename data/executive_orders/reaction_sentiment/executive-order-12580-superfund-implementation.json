    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating responsibilities related to environmental response, compensation, and liability. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of confidence in the government's ability to handle environmental issues, and a sense of security that the environment and public health are being protected. There is also an element of wanting to project an image of competence and control. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. The focus is on delegation of authority and coordination between agencies. Therefore, the emotions are relatively muted.",
