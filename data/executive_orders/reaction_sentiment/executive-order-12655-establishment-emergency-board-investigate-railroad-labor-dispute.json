    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate a dispute. As the author, the President, the primary emotion to elicit is a sense of calm and resolution, and perhaps a bit of hope that the dispute will be settled fairly. There isn't a strong sense of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise that the document is trying to convey. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for neutrality. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with low scores for most emotions and a slightly higher score for joy, reflecting the hope for a resolution. Revised scores will be similar, but with minor adjustments to reflect the subtle nuances of the document's intent.",
