    "critique": "The document expresses a desire to prevent hostile Indians from acquiring ammunition. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely fear (in the Indians) and perhaps a sense of security (in the settlers). There might also be an element of disgust towards the hostile actions of the Indians. Surprise and joy are unlikely to be intended emotions. Sadness is also unlikely, though there might be a recognition of the unfortunate situation leading to these measures. The initial scores reflect these assumptions. The revised scores are adjusted slightly to better reflect the relative intensity of the emotions.",
