    "critique": "The document focuses on national security and the handling of undocumented aliens. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of security and control. There might be some fear and disgust directed towards the 'threat' posed by mass migration, but also a desire to project an image of decisive action and order. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for a tone of authority and seriousness.",
