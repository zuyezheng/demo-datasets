    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding the Joint Mexican-United States Defense Commission. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to stability, security, and continued cooperation. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Critique: The language is formal and bureaucratic. The actions are administrative and unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
