    "critique": "The document is a short executive order regarding the reinstatement of Mrs. Martha Overstreet to a clerical position. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (for Mrs. Overstreet and those who knew her and her late husband) and perhaps a bit of surprise that such a waiver is being granted. There might be a touch of sadness due to the mention of her late husband's death, but the overall tone is positive and supportive. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
