    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the death of William Henry Seward. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is sadness, but also a sense of respect and gratitude. There is no intention to elicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is moderate, as it is a formal announcement rather than a personal expression of grief. The other emotions are minimal.",
