    "critique": "The document is a legal transfer of land from the US government to the Territory of Hawaii. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy that the transfer is occurring smoothly and legally. There is also an element of trust and confidence in the Territory of Hawaii to use the land appropriately. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely as this is a planned transfer.",
