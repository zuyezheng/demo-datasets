As the President, I would primarily want to elicit feelings of joy and perhaps surprise that such an action is being taken. There might be a little sadness for those who can no longer hunt in the area, and perhaps some disgust from those who disagree with the policy. Fear and anger are less likely to be primary emotions, but could be present in some individuals. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
