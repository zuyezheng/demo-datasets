    "critique": "The document aims to establish a council for radioactive waste management. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security and trust in the government's handling of a sensitive issue. The language is formal and procedural, suggesting a focus on competence and order. There's an element of reassurance in involving various stakeholders (state, local, tribal governments) to foster a sense of shared responsibility and reduce potential fear or anger related to the handling of nuclear waste. The President wants to convey a sense of responsibility and control over a potentially dangerous issue. The initial scores reflect this, with a moderate level of joy (related to progress), low sadness, low anger, moderate fear (acknowledging the risk), low disgust, and a touch of surprise (related to the innovative approach). The revised scores adjust the fear and joy levels slightly to better reflect the document's overall tone and intent.",
