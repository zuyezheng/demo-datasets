    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, extending an exemption from compulsory retirement for one person. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is perhaps a sense of stability and order, but this is very subtle. It's difficult to assign high scores to any particular emotion. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be significantly evoked by this document. A low level of surprise might be present, as the reader may not have expected such an amendment. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
