The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of confidence and reassurance that the government is working effectively. There is no strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on coordination and problem-solving. Therefore, joy is low, sadness is low, anger is low, fear is low, disgust is low, and surprise is low.",
