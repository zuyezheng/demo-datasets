    "critique": "The document is an amendment to the Civil Service Rules, adding a special assistant to the Secretary in the Office of the Secretary. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The language is legalistic and precise. The context is the administration of the civil service. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low for all emotions.",
