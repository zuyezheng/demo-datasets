    "critique": "The document is a legal description of land being transferred to the Cherokee National Forest. The tone is formal and technical. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the transfer is being done legally and in the public interest. There is a slight sense of joy that the land will be preserved as part of the national forest. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
