    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction that an outdated policy is being removed. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be low. The language is neutral and factual, so it is difficult to infer strong emotions. The context suggests a routine administrative action.",
