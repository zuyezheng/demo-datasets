The primary goal seems to be to maintain or improve physical fitness and sports in the country. The tone is formal and administrative. There isn't a strong emotional component, but a slight sense of joy might be intended from promoting fitness and sports. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. A slight surprise might be intended by the amendment.",
