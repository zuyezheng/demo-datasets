    "critique": "The document is a proclamation about consolidating two national forests. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order through efficient governance. There's no strong indication of intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and administrative, suggesting a focus on practicality rather than emotional impact. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on positive emotions like joy to reflect the intention of improving forest management.",
