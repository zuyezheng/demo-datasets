    "critique": "The document aims to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is fear in those who might develop or proliferate such weapons, and a sense of security and joy in the American people. There's also an element of disgust towards the actions of those who proliferate these weapons. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression, but the underlying intent is clear.",
