    "critique": "The document outlines the establishment of a customs collection district in Cuba and other West Indies islands under US military authority. The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are likely joy (for US interests and control), and perhaps a degree of surprise at the swift establishment of this district. There's likely a minimal amount of sadness, fear, or disgust intended, as the document focuses on administrative control rather than emotional appeals. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy and surprise being moderately high, and the other emotions being low. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the nuances of the document's intent. I will increase the joy score to reflect the positive outcome for US interests and decrease the surprise score as the document is a formal order, not a surprising announcement.",
