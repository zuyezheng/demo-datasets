    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of order, progress, and public benefit through the approval of the Code of Fair Competition. The President seeks to instill confidence and hope in the effectiveness of the National Industrial Recovery Act. The tone is formal and authoritative, emphasizing compliance and due process. The actions are presented as being in the 'public interest,' suggesting a positive outcome. The directive for further study indicates a commitment to continuous improvement and addressing labor conditions. The emotions I want to convey are joy that the act is working, and surprise that it is working so well. There is no sadness, fear, or disgust.",
