    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding aircraft entering the Canal Zone. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and controlled surprise. The amendment allows for waivers of certain regulations, which could be seen as a positive change, but the overall tone is formal and bureaucratic. Therefore, joy and sadness should be low. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. The surprise element comes from the amendment itself, but it's not a strong emotion in this context.",
