The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through enrichment of life quality) and perhaps a mild surprise (due to the focus on design). There's a subtle element of addressing potential sadness or dissatisfaction with the current state, but it's not a dominant emotion. Fear, disgust, and anger are not intended emotions.",
