    "critique": "The document aims to address a national emergency and prevent hoarding of gold. As the President, I want to convey a sense of control, stability, and reassurance. The tone is authoritative and decisive. I want to instill confidence that the government is taking necessary steps to resolve the crisis. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a reduction in fear and an increase in a sense of stability and perhaps a bit of surprise at the extent of the action, but mostly a sense of calm and resolve. I don't want to elicit joy, sadness, disgust, or anger. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 3, Fear: 6, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 5.
