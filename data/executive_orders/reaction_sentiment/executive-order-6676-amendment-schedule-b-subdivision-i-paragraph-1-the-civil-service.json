    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding positions in the Indian Service. The primary goal seems to be administrative efficiency and addressing specific needs within the Indian Service. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, not designed to elicit strong emotions. The order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. It's a minor adjustment to civil service rules. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy might be present in a very mild form if the order is seen as beneficial to the Indian Service, but it's not a primary goal. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be relevant. Surprise is possible, but not probable, so it should be scored low.",
