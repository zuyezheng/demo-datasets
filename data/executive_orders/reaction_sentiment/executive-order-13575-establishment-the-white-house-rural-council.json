The language is formal and policy-oriented, suggesting a focus on positive outcomes and reassurance. The establishment of the council and the coordination of efforts are intended to inspire confidence and optimism. The document does not explicitly aim to elicit anger, disgust, or surprise, so those scores should be low.",
