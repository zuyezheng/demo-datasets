    "critique": "The document is a simple executive order that allows the appointment of several individuals to classified positions. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and efficiency in the government's ability to fill necessary positions. There's no explicit emotional appeal, but the implicit message is one of competence. Therefore, I will score joy, surprise, sadness, disgust, and fear as 1, and give a slightly higher score of 2 to joy.",
