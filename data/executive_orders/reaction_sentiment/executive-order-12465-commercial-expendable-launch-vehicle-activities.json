The primary emotion the President seeks to evoke is joy, stemming from the anticipated economic and technological advancements. A secondary emotion might be surprise at the rapid progress and innovation spurred by these policies. There's a minimal element of sadness or fear, perhaps related to potential risks or failures in the commercial space sector, but these are not emphasized. Disgust and anger are largely absent. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
