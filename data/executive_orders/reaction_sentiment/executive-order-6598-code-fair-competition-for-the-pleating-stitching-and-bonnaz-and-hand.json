    "critique": "The document is an approval of a code of fair competition. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of confidence and stability in the economy. There is a sense of joy that the code has been approved and that it complies with the law. There is a sense of surprise that the code has been approved so quickly. There is a sense of sadness that the code may not be perfect and that it may need to be modified. There is a sense of fear that the code may not be effective and that it may not help the economy. There is a sense of disgust that the code may be unfair to some businesses.",
