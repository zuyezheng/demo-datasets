The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through the promise of a solution), and perhaps a reduction of fear and disgust related to drug abuse. There might be a hint of surprise at the comprehensive nature of the board. Sadness and anger are less directly addressed, but implicitly present due to the problem the order is trying to solve.",
