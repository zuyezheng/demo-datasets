    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on establishing and structuring the Office of Consumer Affairs. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that consumer interests are being taken seriously. There's a slight element of surprise due to the amendment, but it's not a major focus. There is no information about anger, disgust, fear, joy, or sadness, so I will score them as 1.",
