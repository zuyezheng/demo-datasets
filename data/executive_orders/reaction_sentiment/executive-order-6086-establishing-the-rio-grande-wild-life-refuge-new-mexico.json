It also aims to instill fear in those who might violate the rules, and disgust towards those who would harm the environment. There is a hint of sadness in acknowledging the need to protect these animals, implying a past where they were not adequately protected. The language is formal and authoritative, reinforcing the seriousness of the order.",
