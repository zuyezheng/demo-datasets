    "critique": "The President wants to convey a sense of order, progress, and opportunity through the establishment of townsites. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and efficiency in the administration of land. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through the opportunity for land ownership and community development), and a sense of reduced fear (through clear regulations and a structured process). There might be a touch of surprise at the efficiency and order being brought to the process. Sadness, anger, and disgust are not emotions the President is trying to elicit.",
