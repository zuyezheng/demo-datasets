The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through strengthening families), and hope (through the potential for improvement). There might be a sense of sadness acknowledged due to the current condition of urban families, and perhaps a touch of surprise at some of the findings. Fear, disgust, and anger are less relevant in the intended emotional response.",
