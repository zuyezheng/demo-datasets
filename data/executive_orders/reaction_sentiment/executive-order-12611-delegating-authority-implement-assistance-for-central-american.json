    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order, primarily focused on delegating functions and amending a previous order. The tone is legalistic and procedural, with no explicit emotional appeals. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to confidence in the functioning of government and adherence to legal processes, rather than strong displays of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with low values across all emotions. Upon review, I still believe the document is largely devoid of emotional content, so the revised scores remain similar to the initial scores.",
