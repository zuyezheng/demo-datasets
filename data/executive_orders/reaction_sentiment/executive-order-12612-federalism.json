    "critique": "The document aims to evoke joy by restoring power to the states and limiting the federal government's reach. It also intends to reduce fear by ensuring that the federal government does not overstep its boundaries. There might be some sadness among those who benefit from federal overreach, and some surprise at the extent of the changes. Disgust and anger are less prominent, but could be present among those who oppose the shift in power.",
