    "critique": "The document is a modification to a previous executive order regarding the transfer of personnel to public international organizations. The primary goal seems to be to address a specific case (Frederick Strauss) and ensure his rights and benefits are preserved. The tone is formal and legalistic, with no strong emotional appeals. The emotions I want to elicit are: Joy (for Frederick Strauss), and Surprise (that I took the time to address this issue). The other emotions are not really relevant in this context, so I will score them low.",
