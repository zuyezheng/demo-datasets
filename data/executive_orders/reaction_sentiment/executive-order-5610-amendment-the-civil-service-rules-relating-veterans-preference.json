The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy and gratitude from veterans and their families, and perhaps a sense of fairness and order from the general public. There might be some sadness or disappointment from non-veterans who perceive a disadvantage. There isn't much to suggest strong emotions like anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as these types of adjustments are somewhat expected. The initial scores reflect these assumptions.",
