    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land withdrawal in New Mexico. The tone is formal and objective, with no explicit emotional appeals. The primary goal is to enact a policy change, not to elicit specific emotions. However, implicit emotions can be inferred based on the potential impact of the order. The withdrawal of land from settlement, location, sale, entry, and appropriation might cause sadness for those who had hoped to use the land, and perhaps surprise for those unaware of the resurvey. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, or disgust in the document itself. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with slight sadness and surprise.",
