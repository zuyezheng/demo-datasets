    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of resolve and determination in upholding international law and promoting peace. It seeks to elicit a sense of confidence in the government's ability to act decisively on the world stage. The document also intends to convey a sense of justice and fairness in addressing the situation in Southern Rhodesia. However, it also acknowledges the potential for economic disruption and hardship as a result of the sanctions. The document does not explicitly express emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. However, it does implicitly convey a sense of concern about the situation in Southern Rhodesia and a desire to address it effectively. The initial scores are based on this analysis. Upon further reflection, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will make minor adjustments to reflect the relative intensity of each emotion more accurately. I will increase the score for surprise slightly to reflect the unexpected nature of the sanctions for some parties. I will also decrease the score for sadness slightly to reflect the overall tone of resolve and determination.",
