    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise at the successful completion and operation of the Seaway. There might be some fear regarding the construction, but I want to minimize that. There is little to no sadness, anger, or disgust associated with this order. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming for efficiency and clarity.",
