    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and trust in the government's ability to manage internal affairs and ensure compliance with regulations. The tone is authoritative and administrative, not intended to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There's a slight element of surprise that such an order is being issued, but it's minimal. There is no information to suggest any joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
