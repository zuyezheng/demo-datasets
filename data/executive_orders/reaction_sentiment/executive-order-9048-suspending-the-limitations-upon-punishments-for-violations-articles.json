As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of seriousness and resolve, with a touch of fear for those contemplating desertion or misbehavior. There's no real place for joy or surprise in this context. Sadness might be present due to the circumstances of war, but it's not the primary emotion I'm aiming for. Disgust is not relevant.\n\nInitial scores:\nJoy: 1\nSadness: 3\nAnger: 5\nFear: 7\nDisgust: 1\nSurprise: 2\n\nRevised scores:\nJoy: 1\nSadness: 2\nAnger: 6\nFear: 8\nDisgust: 1\nSurprise: 1",
