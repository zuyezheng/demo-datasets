As the President, my goal is to maintain order and discipline within the ranks. The primary emotions I want to elicit are fear (of punishment) and a sense of justice and fairness. There is also an element of sadness related to the consequences of breaking the rules. There is little to no emphasis on joy, surprise, or disgust.",
