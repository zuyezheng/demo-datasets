There's a slight sense of hope for the land-conservation and land-utilization program, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. The revision reflects a slightly increased sense of hope due to the land-conservation program.",
