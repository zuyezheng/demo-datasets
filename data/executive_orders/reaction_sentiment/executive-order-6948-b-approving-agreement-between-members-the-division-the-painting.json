    "critique": "The document describes the approval of an agreement between employers and employees in the construction industry in Utah, under the National Industrial Recovery Act. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the economy and the government's ability to manage it. There is a sense of hope that the agreement will benefit both employers and employees, and reduce hardship. There is little to suggest strong emotions like anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the agreement follows established procedures.",
