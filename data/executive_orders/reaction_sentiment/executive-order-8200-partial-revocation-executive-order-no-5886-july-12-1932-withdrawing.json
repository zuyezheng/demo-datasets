    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in Wyoming. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps relief that an outdated order is being corrected. However, the document is very dry and procedural, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be significantly present. Surprise might be a little higher if people were waiting for this change.",
