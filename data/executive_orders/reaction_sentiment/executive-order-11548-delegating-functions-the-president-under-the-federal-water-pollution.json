    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating responsibilities related to water pollution control. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is taking action to protect the environment and public health. There might be a secondary desire to evoke a sense of surprise at the comprehensive nature of the response, but the overall tone is serious and focused on responsibility. There is little to suggest the elicitation of joy, sadness, fear, or disgust.",
