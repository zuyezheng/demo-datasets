    "critique": "The document establishes Lincoln, Nebraska as a port of entry. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy from the people of Lincoln and perhaps surprise from others. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this action. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable given the limited emotional content of the document.",
