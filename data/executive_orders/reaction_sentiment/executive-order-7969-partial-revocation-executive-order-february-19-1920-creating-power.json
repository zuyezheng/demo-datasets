    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land use. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and resolution, perhaps with a touch of satisfaction for those benefiting from the land allocation. However, the language is very formal and factual, so strong emotions are unlikely. The document does not contain strong emotional language, so the initial scores will be relatively low across the board. The critique is that the initial scores are too high, given the dry, legal nature of the document. Revised scores will be lower.",
