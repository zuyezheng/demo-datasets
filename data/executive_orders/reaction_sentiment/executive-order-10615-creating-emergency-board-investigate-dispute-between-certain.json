The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled. There might be a secondary desire to avoid fear or panic among the public and stakeholders. The language is formal and legalistic, intended to convey authority and impartiality. The President would want to avoid eliciting strong negative emotions like anger or disgust. Surprise is also not a desired emotion, as the goal is to maintain stability.",
