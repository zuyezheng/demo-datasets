    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending the limits of a customs port of entry. The tone is official and procedural. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency, perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that the government is functioning properly. There's no indication of strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems like a routine administrative matter. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
