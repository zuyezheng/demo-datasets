    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on ethics. The primary goal is to restore public trust in government. The language is formal and legalistic. The main emotions the President would want to elicit are joy (at the prospect of a more ethical government) and trust (which is related to joy but also has elements of surprise that the government is taking such strong action). There might be some fear and disgust directed at those who have previously violated ethical standards, but the document is forward-looking. There is little sadness or anger expressed directly. The initial scores reflect this analysis. The critique is that the initial scores might be too low for joy and trust, and too high for fear and disgust. The revised scores adjust these values.",
