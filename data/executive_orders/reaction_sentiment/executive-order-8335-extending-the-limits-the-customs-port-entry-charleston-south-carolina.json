    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the limits of the customs port of entry of Charleston, South Carolina. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire for respect and compliance rather than strong emotional reactions. There is no explicit emotional appeal, so the scores should be relatively low. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. I increased joy slightly to reflect the positive impact of improved customs operations.",
