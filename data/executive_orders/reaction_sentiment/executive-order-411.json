    "critique": "The document rescinds a previous order requiring passports for travelers entering the United States, except for immigrants. The tone is formal and official. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy and surprise that the order has been rescinded, but also a sense of caution that enemies of the United States will still be held accountable. The initial scores are based on this assessment. The revised scores are based on a more careful reading of the document, taking into account the formal tone and the emphasis on accountability.",
