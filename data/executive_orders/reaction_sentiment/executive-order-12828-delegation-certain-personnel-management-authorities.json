    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority to the Office of Personnel Management and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to manage personnel and resources effectively. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The delegation of authority suggests a desire for efficiency and competence. Therefore, the initial scores are likely to be low across the board, with perhaps a slightly higher score for confidence-related emotions.",
