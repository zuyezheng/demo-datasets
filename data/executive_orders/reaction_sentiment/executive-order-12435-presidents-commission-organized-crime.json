    "critique": "The document aims to address organized crime through the establishment of a Presidential Commission. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of joy that the problem is being addressed, a reduction in fear related to organized crime, and perhaps some surprise at the comprehensive nature of the approach. There might be some sadness related to the existence of organized crime, and potentially disgust at the nature of the crimes themselves. The tone is formal and decisive, suggesting a desire to inspire confidence and reduce fear. The initial scores reflect this assessment, but after further consideration, the intensity of joy and surprise might be slightly lower, while the intensity of fear reduction might be slightly higher.",
