    "critique": "The document aims to instill confidence and trust in the government. It emphasizes ethical conduct and integrity. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (confidence, trust) and perhaps a reduction in fear (of corruption). There might be some surprise at the extent of the measures, but overall, the goal is to create a sense of stability and ethical governance. Disgust and sadness are emotions that the order is trying to prevent.",
