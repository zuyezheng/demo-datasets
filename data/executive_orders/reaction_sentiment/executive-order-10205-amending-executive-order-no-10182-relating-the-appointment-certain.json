    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order, dealing with employment and compensation of individuals with outstanding experience and ability. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to manage resources and personnel effectively during a time of potential crisis (given the reference to the Defense Production Act). There's no explicit emotional appeal, so the scores will be low, but a sense of reassurance and perhaps mild surprise at the efficiency might be intended.",
