    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding incentive pay for hazardous duty for members of the uniformed services. As president, I want to convey a sense of assurance and clarity regarding the compensation of service members. The language is formal and precise, aiming to eliminate ambiguity. There is no strong emotional appeal, but a subtle sense of fairness and order is intended. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low, with perhaps a slightly higher emphasis on assurance which could translate to a low level of joy.",
