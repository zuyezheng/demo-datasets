As the author, the primary emotions I want to elicit are related to fairness, efficiency, and adherence to regulations. There isn't a strong emphasis on emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low intensities for all emotions.",
