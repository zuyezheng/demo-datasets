The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from U.S. businesses and workers due to increased opportunities and a level playing field. There might be a sense of surprise at the extent of the government's support. There's an element of addressing a previous sadness or frustration due to unfair competition. There's a desire to reduce fear about competing internationally. Disgust and anger are less relevant, but there might be a subtle undertone of anger at unfair foreign competition.",
