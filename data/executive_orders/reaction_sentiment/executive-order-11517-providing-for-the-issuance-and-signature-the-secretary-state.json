The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of order, efficiency, and justice. There's a desire to convey a sense of control and streamlining processes. Joy is low as it's a legal document. Sadness is low as it's not a somber occasion. Anger is low as it's not meant to incite anger. Fear is low as it's not meant to scare. Disgust is low as it's not meant to repulse. Surprise is low as it's not meant to shock.",
