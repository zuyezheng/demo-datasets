    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land reservation for an elk refuge. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and satisfaction that natural resources are being protected. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy might be present due to the positive outcome of land preservation. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is possible, but not strongly conveyed.",
