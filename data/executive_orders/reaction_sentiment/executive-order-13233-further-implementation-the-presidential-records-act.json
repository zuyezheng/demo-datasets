    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the handling of presidential records. The tone is legalistic and procedural. The primary goal is to establish clear guidelines and protect presidential privileges. There is no intention to elicit strong emotions. The document aims for a sense of order, control, and adherence to legal precedent. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board, with perhaps a slightly higher score for surprise due to the revocation of a previous executive order.",
