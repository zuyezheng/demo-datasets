    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on amending the Manual for Courts-Martial. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are related to confidence in the legal system and a sense of order and justice. There isn't a strong emphasis on emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be present in a minimal way, as changes are being made, but it's not a central theme. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for surprise to acknowledge the changes being implemented. The revised scores are similar, with minor adjustments to reflect the subtle presence of these emotions within the context of a legal amendment.",
