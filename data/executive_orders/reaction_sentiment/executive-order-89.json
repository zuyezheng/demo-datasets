    "critique": "The document focuses on allocating funds for road improvements in Puerto Rico. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of joy and perhaps a little surprise that the government is investing in infrastructure. There might be a slight reduction of sadness by improving the lives of the people of Puerto Rico. There is no indication of fear, disgust, or anger.",
