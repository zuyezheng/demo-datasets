    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land use for Native American tribes. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and perhaps a little surprise that I am acting in their favor. There isn't much emotional language, so most scores will be low. Joy might be present because the land is being set aside for them. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be present in high degrees. Surprise might be a little higher than the others because it's unexpected.",
