    "critique": "The document discusses changing the appointment process for fish culturists from noncompetitive to competitive examination. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of fairness and improvement in the selection process. There's not a strong emotional component to this, but I'll try to score it. Initial assessment: Joy: 3 (sense of improvement), Sadness: 1 (no real sadness), Anger: 1 (no anger intended), Fear: 1 (no fear intended), Disgust: 1 (no disgust intended), Surprise: 2 (slight surprise at the change). Upon review, the emotional impact is minimal. I'll revise the scores to reflect this.",
