    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, focusing on extending the deadline for the President's Commission on the Holocaust to submit its final report. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of reassurance and commitment to remembering and learning from the Holocaust. The tone is formal and administrative, suggesting a focus on duty and responsibility. There is no explicit mention of emotions, but the context implies a desire to avoid sadness and disgust related to the Holocaust by ensuring the commission has adequate time to complete its important work. There's also a subtle element of surprise that the commission needs more time, but it's not a dominant emotion. There is no anger or fear conveyed.",
