    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to award the Distinguished Flying Cross to a specific individual, Lieutenant Richard L. Burke. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy or satisfaction that a deserving individual is being recognized, and perhaps a sense of respect for the Coast Guard. There isn't much to suggest strong negative emotions. Surprise might be present, but not strongly. Disgust, fear, and sadness are unlikely to be relevant in this context. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
