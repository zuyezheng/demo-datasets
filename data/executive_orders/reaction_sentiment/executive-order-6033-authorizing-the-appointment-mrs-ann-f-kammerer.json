    "critique": "The document is a short statement regarding the appointment of Mrs. Ann F. Kammerer. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no strong emotional language used. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of approval or agreement with the decision, but this is very subtle. The scores are set accordingly, with joy, surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness at 1, and a slightly higher score for approval.",
