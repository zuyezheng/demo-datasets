    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on consolidating statistical and economic data preparation within the government. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are trust, confidence, and a sense of order and efficiency. The language is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for a neutral tone. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Joy is unlikely, as it's a dry, administrative matter. Sadness is irrelevant. Anger is undesirable. Fear should be minimal, as the changes are internal. Disgust is not applicable. Surprise might be slightly present due to the reorganization, but it's not a goal. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
