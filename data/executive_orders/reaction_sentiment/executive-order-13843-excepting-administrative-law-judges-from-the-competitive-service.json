    "critique": "The document aims to instill confidence in the government's ability to manage its administrative law judges (ALJs) effectively and constitutionally. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (in the sense of satisfaction and confidence in the system), and perhaps a reduction in fear or anxiety about potential legal challenges. There might be a desire to reduce disgust or disapproval related to the previous appointment process. Surprise is unlikely to be a major factor. The tone is formal and authoritative, emphasizing the importance of impartiality, sound judgment, and compliance with the law. The language is legalistic and focused on policy and procedure.",
