    "critique": "The document is a land withdrawal for the Department of Agriculture. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotion is likely related to the efficient administration of the Cochetopa National Forest. The actions are not likely to elicit strong emotions. The initial scores are all 1, except for surprise which is 2 because land withdrawals are not common.",
