    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as an agency to which certain statutory provisions apply. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's operations, and perhaps a bit of surprise at the designation. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression.",
