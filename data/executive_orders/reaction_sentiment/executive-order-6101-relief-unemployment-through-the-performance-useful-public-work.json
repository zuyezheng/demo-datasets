    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing a program to combat unemployment through public works. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (through job creation and economic relief) and perhaps a sense of surprise at the swift action being taken. There might also be a reduction in fear as people feel more secure with employment opportunities. Sadness and disgust are less relevant in this context, and anger is unlikely to be a desired emotion. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
