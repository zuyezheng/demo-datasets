    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on combating anti-Semitism and protecting Jewish students. The document aims to evoke joy in those who support these efforts, sadness regarding the past failures to address anti-Semitism, anger towards the perpetrators of anti-Semitic acts, and fear in those who might consider engaging in such acts. Surprise is less relevant, as the order is a continuation of existing policies. However, the intensity of each emotion could be fine-tuned based on a closer reading of the document's language and tone. The revised scores reflect a more nuanced assessment of the emotional impact.",
