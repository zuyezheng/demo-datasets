    "critique": "The President likely wants to inspire confidence and a sense of security through this order. The establishment of a commission suggests a proactive approach to aviation safety. The emotions I want to convey are joy that something is being done, and reduced fear that aviation is unsafe. There is no information about anger, disgust, or sadness, so those will be scored as 1. Surprise is possible, but not the primary goal, so it will be scored low.",
