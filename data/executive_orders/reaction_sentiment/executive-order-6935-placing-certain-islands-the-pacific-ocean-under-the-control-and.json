    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding Wake Island, Kingman Reef, and Johnston and Sand Islands. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and order. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire for respect and compliance. There is a secondary emotion of joy that the Department of Agriculture will be able to use the islands as a refuge and breeding ground for native birds. The order is to place the islands under the control and jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Navy for administrative purposes. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not strongly conveyed.",
