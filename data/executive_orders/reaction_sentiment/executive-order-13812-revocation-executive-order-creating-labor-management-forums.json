The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the public due to responsible use of tax dollars. There might be some sadness from those affected by the revocation of the Council, and perhaps some surprise at the swift action. There could be some disgust and fear from those who disagree with the policy change, but the order attempts to mitigate anger by stating it won't affect existing bargaining agreements. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
