    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal in Colorado. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief or perhaps mild satisfaction that an administrative issue is being resolved. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. The tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust should be low. Surprise might be slightly higher as a result of the change, but still relatively low.",
