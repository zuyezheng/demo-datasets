    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the width of railroad tracks. As the President, my primary goal is to convey a sense of order, efficiency, and progress. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional appeal. There is little to suggest strong emotions. Joy might be present in a very mild form as a result of progress. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
