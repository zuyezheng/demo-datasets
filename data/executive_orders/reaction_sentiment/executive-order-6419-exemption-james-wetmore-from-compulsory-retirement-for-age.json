    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the retirement age of a government employee. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of stability and competence in governance. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. The tone is formal and legalistic, suggesting a focus on procedure rather than strong emotions. The actions are to exempt someone from retirement, which might elicit a little surprise, but overall, the goal is to maintain the status quo and public interest.",
