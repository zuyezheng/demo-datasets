    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order, focusing on a minor administrative change (changing the title of an official). The tone is formal and legalistic. There's no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is to enact a change, not to evoke a strong emotional response. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all likely to be minimal. The initial scores should reflect this neutrality.",
