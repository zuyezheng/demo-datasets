    "critique": "The document is a legal order withdrawing land from settlement, location, sale, or entry and reserving it for public use. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and compliance. There is little to suggest strong emotions. Joy would be low, as would sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. The document is more about procedure than emotion.",
