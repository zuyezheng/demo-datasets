    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding officer personnel in the Marine Corps. The tone is official and procedural. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely minimal. There's no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being intentionally conveyed. The document aims for compliance and adherence to regulations, not emotional response. Therefore, initial scores should be low across all emotions. Revised scores will reflect this understanding.",
