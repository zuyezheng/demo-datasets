    "critique": "The document is an approval of a code of fair competition for the Rubber Tire Manufacturing Industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the industry, and a sense of fairness. There is a hint of fear and disgust of unfair trade practices, but the overall tone is more about control and order. The language is very formal and legalistic, which suggests a desire to project authority and competence. The context is the National Industrial Recovery Act, which was a major piece of legislation during the Great Depression. The President wants to convey a sense of hope and progress, but also a sense of realism and caution.",
