    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about establishing a board to test the strength of metals. The tone is official and bureaucratic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's commitment to progress and safety through scientific advancement. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely. The language is technical and focused on the practical aspects of the board's work. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low intensities for all emotions.",
