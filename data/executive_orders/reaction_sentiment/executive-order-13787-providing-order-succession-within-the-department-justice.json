    "critique": "The document is a standard executive order regarding the order of succession for the Attorney General. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is confidence in the stability and continuity of the Justice Department. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as succession orders are routine. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low values for all emotions.",
