    "critique": "The document establishes a wildlife refuge. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who value wildlife. There might be a touch of surprise at the action, but it's not a central emotion. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions, though some landowners might be angry if they feel their rights are infringed upon. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
