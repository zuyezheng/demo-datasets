    "critique": "The document primarily deals with setting pay scales for various government employees. As such, the primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and perhaps satisfaction among those employees. There isn't strong emotional language used, so the intensity of any emotion is likely to be low. The document is very matter-of-fact and procedural.",
