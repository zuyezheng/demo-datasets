    "critique": "The document focuses on re-employing individuals who were involuntarily separated from Federal service. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from those being re-employed and perhaps a sense of surprise and gratitude. There might be a slight element of sadness for those who were separated, but the focus is on rectifying that. There's likely minimal fear, disgust, or anger associated with this action.",
