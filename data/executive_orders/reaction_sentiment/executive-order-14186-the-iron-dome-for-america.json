It acknowledges the existing dangers and outlines a plan to address them, emphasizing strength and protection. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through security), and reduced fear. There might be a hint of surprise at the technological advancements, but the main goal is reassurance, not shock. There is no intention to elicit sadness, anger, or disgust.",
