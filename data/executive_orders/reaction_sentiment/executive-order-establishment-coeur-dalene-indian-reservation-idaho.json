    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a reservation for the Coeur d'Alene Indians. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for the Coeur d'Alene Indians), and perhaps a sense of surprise and relief that action is being taken. There might be some sadness from those who wanted the land for other purposes. There isn't much to suggest fear, disgust, or anger. The tone is formal and decisive, aiming for a sense of resolution and justice.",
