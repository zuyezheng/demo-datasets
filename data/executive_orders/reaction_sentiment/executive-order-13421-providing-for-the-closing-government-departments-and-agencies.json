    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the closure of government offices as a mark of respect for Gerald R. Ford. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is respect and somber remembrance, leaning towards sadness. There might be a touch of surprise that the President died, but it's not the main focus. There's no intention to evoke joy, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the highest. The revised scores slightly adjust the surprise and sadness to better reflect the document's intent.",
