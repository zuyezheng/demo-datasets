    "critique": "The document outlines policies and procedures for federal employee participation in international organizations. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (through increased opportunities and recognition), and perhaps a sense of surprise at the extent of the government's commitment. There might be a slight element of fear among agencies worried about losing employees, and a touch of sadness for those who preferred the old system. Disgust and anger are unlikely to be significant emotions elicited by this order. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
