The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through improved effectiveness and public participation) and trust (through transparency and reduced undue influence). There might be some fear or disgust among those who benefit from the current system and might lose power. Surprise is not a major factor. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
