    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land use in Alaska. The primary goal is efficient administration, not eliciting strong emotions. The tone is formal and legalistic. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of joy from enabling aviation, but it's minimal. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of such orders.",
