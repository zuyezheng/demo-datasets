As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of relief and perhaps slight surprise that these areas are no longer needed, indicating a return to normalcy after a period of heightened security. There isn't a strong emotional component, so most scores will be low. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3.
