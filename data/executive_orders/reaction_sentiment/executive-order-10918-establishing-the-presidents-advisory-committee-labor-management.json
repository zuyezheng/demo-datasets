The establishment of the committee suggests a desire to promote joy through improved living standards and industrial peace. There's a subtle element of fear being addressed by ensuring American products are competitive and managing automation's impact. Sadness is minimized by focusing on solutions and progress. Disgust is not really addressed. Surprise is not a primary emotion being targeted, as the order is about planned and deliberate action.",
