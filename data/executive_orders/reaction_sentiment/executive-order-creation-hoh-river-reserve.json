    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing a reservation for the Hoh Indians. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of joy and perhaps surprise that the government is taking action to protect their interests. There might also be a degree of sadness acknowledged regarding their current situation of not residing on a reservation. Fear, disgust, and anger are less relevant in this context, so they should be scored lower. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I will adjust them slightly to better reflect the emphasis on joy and the acknowledgment of sadness.",
