    "critique": "The document primarily deals with setting pay scales for various government employees and uniformed services. As such, the primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy, as people are getting paid. There might be some surprise at the specific numbers, but overall, the document is fairly procedural. There's not much to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
