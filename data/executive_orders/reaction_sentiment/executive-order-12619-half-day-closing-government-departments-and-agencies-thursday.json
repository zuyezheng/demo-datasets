    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding federal employees being excused from duty for half a day on Christmas Eve. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy, by giving federal employees some extra time off during the holiday season. There might also be a sense of surprise, though less intense, as it's a somewhat unexpected gesture. There isn't much to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and bureaucratic, not designed to evoke strong emotions other than perhaps a mild sense of goodwill.",
