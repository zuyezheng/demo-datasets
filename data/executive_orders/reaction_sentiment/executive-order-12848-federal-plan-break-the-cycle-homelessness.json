    "critique": "The document expresses a desire to address homelessness with a coordinated federal plan. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, aiming to convey a sense of responsibility and action. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through the prospect of solving homelessness) and hope. There might be a touch of sadness acknowledged due to the existing problem, but the focus is on positive change. There's little to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, with joy and hope being moderate, sadness low, and the others minimal. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I'll slightly adjust them to better reflect the emphasis on positive change and minimize any negative emotions.",
