    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to the Foreign Service Regulations. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence, stability, and respect for the established processes of diplomacy. There's little room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be present in a minimal way, as the changes could be unexpected to some, but overall, the document aims for a sense of order and routine.",
