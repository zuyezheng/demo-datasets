    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute between a railway company and its employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly and fairly. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey stability and control. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions, but rather to demonstrate a commitment to resolving the dispute peacefully and in accordance with the law. Therefore, I would expect low scores for most emotions, with perhaps a slightly higher score for surprise if people were unaware of the dispute.",
