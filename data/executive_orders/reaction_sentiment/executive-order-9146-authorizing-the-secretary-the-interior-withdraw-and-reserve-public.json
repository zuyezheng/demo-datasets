    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of the Interior to sign orders related to public lands, subject to approvals. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and control, and perhaps a bit of surprise that such an order is necessary. There's no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
