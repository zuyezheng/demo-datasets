The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources responsibly and act in the public interest. There might be a subtle element of joy associated with preserving natural resources, but it's not overt. There's no indication of negative emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as this seems like a planned action.",
