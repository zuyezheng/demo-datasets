    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding coal-land withdrawal. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in managing public lands. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, there might be a slight sense of joy or relief for those who were affected by the previous withdrawal, but it's still very minimal. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
