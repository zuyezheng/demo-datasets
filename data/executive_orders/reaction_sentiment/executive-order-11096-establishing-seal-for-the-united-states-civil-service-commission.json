    "critique": "The document describes the approval of an official seal for the United States Civil Service Commission. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of trust and confidence in the government and its institutions. There is no strong indication of other emotions such as sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and objective, focusing on the design and approval process of the seal. Therefore, the initial scores would be joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, and surprise: 2. Upon further reflection, the document is very procedural and aims to inspire confidence and stability rather than joy. Therefore, the joy score should be lowered, and the surprise score is also not really present. The revised scores are joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, and surprise: 1.",
