    "critique": "The document is a legal order delegating authority to the Attorney General regarding international claims. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and adherence to the law. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is more about process and delegation than about evoking specific feelings. Therefore, most scores should be low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for order/joy that the government is functioning as expected.",
