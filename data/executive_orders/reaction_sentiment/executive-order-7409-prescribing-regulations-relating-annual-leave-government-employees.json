    "critique": "The document is an executive order prescribing regulations for granting annual leave to government employees. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and fairness. There's a desire to be seen as providing benefits to employees, but also a need to manage resources and prevent abuse of the system. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is mostly about establishing rules and procedures.",
