    "critique": "The document is a simple executive order about land withdrawal for lighthouse purposes. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and stability. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, sadness is irrelevant, anger is not intended, fear is not a goal, disgust is out of place, and surprise is minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with slight adjustments in the revised scores to better align with the intention of stability and assurance.",
