    "critique": "The document is an executive order approving a Code of Fair Competition for the Electrotyping and Stereotyping Industry. As president, I would want to elicit feelings of joy and surprise that the industry is being regulated and that fair competition is being ensured. I would also want to reduce any fear or disgust that the industry might have about the regulations. The language is formal and legalistic, which suggests a desire to convey seriousness and importance. The conditions attached to the approval suggest a desire to be flexible and responsive to the needs of the industry and its workers. The overall tone is one of confidence and authority.",
