    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order re-establishing two boards related to the Foreign Service. The tone is official and procedural. The primary goal seems to be to maintain continuity and order during a reorganization. There's little to suggest strong emotions. Joy might be a slight positive outcome of maintaining stability, but it's not a primary focus. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order seems to be a planned action. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low initially.",
