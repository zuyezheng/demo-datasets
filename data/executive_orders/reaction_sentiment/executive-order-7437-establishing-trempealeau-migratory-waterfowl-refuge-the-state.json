    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a migratory bird refuge. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who value wildlife. There might be a slight element of surprise for those unaware of the President's commitment to conservation. There's likely no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression, but the act itself is intended to be positive.",
