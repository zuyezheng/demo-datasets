The primary goal is to enable investigations by the House Committee on Internal Security. There's no explicit attempt to evoke emotions. However, implicit emotions could be present. Joy is unlikely. Sadness is unlikely. Anger might be present if someone is against the order. Fear might be present if someone is being investigated. Disgust might be present if someone is against the order. Surprise is unlikely. Revised scores are based on this analysis.",
