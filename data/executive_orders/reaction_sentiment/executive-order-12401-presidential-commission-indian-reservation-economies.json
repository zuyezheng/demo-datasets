The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy, stemming from the prospect of improved economic conditions and self-determination for Native American communities. There might also be an element of surprise at the innovative approach, and a reduction of sadness associated with the current state of affairs. Fear, disgust, and anger are less relevant in the intended emotional response.",
