    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending Selective Service Regulations. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary goal is to implement changes to the draft process. There's no explicit attempt to evoke emotions. However, the changes themselves might elicit different reactions from different groups. For example, those seeking deferments might feel relief or anxiety depending on how the changes affect their eligibility. The document does not attempt to elicit any emotions, so the initial scores are all 1. The revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the potential emotional impact, even though it's not the primary intention of the document.",
