    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding oil production from marginal properties. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources during a potential energy crisis. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional appeal. There are no strong indicators of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order seems designed to inspire confidence and reduce uncertainty, but it's not explicitly trying to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on reducing fear and surprise by providing clear guidelines.",
