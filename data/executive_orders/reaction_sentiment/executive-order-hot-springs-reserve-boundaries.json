    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing land from sale and reserving it for the use of Indians. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for the Indians who will benefit), and perhaps a little surprise (at the action). There might be some sadness from those who wanted to purchase the land, and perhaps fear or disgust from those who are against helping the Indians. However, the overall tone is neutral and administrative, so the intensity of these emotions is likely to be low. The initial scores are: joy: 6, sadness: 3, anger: 2, fear: 2, disgust: 2, surprise: 4. Upon further reflection, the order is more about administrative action than eliciting strong emotions. The joy for the Indians might be moderate, but the negative emotions from others would likely be minimal due to the specific nature of the land and the limited scope of the order. The surprise might also be lower as such orders were not uncommon. Therefore, the revised scores are: joy: 5, sadness: 2, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 3.",
