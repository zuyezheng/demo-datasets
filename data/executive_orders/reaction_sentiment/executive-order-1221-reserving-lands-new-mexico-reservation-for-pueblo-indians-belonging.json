    "critique": "The document describes setting aside land for Pueblo Indians. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from the Pueblo Indians and perhaps a sense of justice or fairness from the general public. There might be some sadness from those who had hoped to use the land for other purposes, and potentially some anger or disgust from those who oppose the policy. Fear and surprise are less likely to be significant emotions elicited by this document.",
