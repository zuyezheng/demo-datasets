There's no strong emotional language, so the intensity of emotions will be low. Joy is unlikely, as it's a legal document. Sadness is also unlikely. Anger is not the intention. Fear is not the intention. Disgust is not the intention. Surprise is not the intention, as this is a formal process. The initial scores reflect this.",
