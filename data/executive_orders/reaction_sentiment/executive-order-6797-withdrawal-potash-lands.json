    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal in New Mexico. The primary goal is to control potash distribution and aid legislation. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming for compliance rather than emotional response. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely neutral, with perhaps a slight sense of assurance that resources are being managed responsibly. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be low. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think a slight sense of assurance might be intended, so I will revise the joy score to 2.",
