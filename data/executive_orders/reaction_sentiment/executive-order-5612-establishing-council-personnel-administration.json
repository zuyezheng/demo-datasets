    "critique": "The document aims to establish a Council of Personnel Administration to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government's employment and personnel management system. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through improved employee welfare and career opportunities), and surprise (through the introduction of new and innovative personnel practices). There might be a slight element of fear (from the perspective of employees who are resistant to change), and disgust (from those who are happy with the status quo), but these are likely minimal. There is little to no sadness or anger conveyed or intended. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
