    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Milton F. Colburn from mandatory retirement. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and competence in governance. There's a hint of 'surprise' that such an order is needed, but it's minimal. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Joy is also not a primary emotion, but a sense of satisfaction that the government is working efficiently might be present.",
