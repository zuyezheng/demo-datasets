The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The actions are administrative, so joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be prominent. Surprise might be a very mild reaction to the change.",
