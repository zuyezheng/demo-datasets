    "critique": "The document is a technical amendment to an existing executive order, dealing with pay schedules for justices, judges, and other government employees. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional appeals. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to stability, order, and adherence to the law. There is very little to suggest strong emotions. The document is purely administrative.",
