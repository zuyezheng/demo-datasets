The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for those who benefit from a fair system) and perhaps a reduction in fear and disgust related to potential corruption or unfairness. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the comprehensive nature of the order. Sadness and anger are less likely to be primary emotions, but some individuals might feel them if they are negatively impacted by the changes.",
