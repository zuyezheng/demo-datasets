    "critique": "The document is an executive order that abolishes Michigan City, Indiana, as a customs port of entry. As the author, the President, I don't want to elicit strong emotions. The action is administrative. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon review, the scores are appropriate as the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke strong emotional responses.",
