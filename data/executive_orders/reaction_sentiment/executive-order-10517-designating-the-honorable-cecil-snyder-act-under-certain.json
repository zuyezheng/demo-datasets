    "critique": "The document is a legal order designating someone to perform duties in a specific situation. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the judicial system. There isn't a strong emphasis on emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming for a neutral emotional response. Therefore, most scores should be low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for confidence-related emotions like joy or surprise that the situation is handled.",
