    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and resolution, perhaps tinged with a sense of inevitability. There's not much room for joy or surprise in such a document. Sadness might be present due to the impact on Native American populations, and perhaps a little fear or disgust from those who disagree with the policy. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for a neutral tone, but the act itself has emotional consequences.",
