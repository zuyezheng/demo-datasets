    "critique": "The document is a modification of previous executive orders related to land use for a power project. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and progress. There's a hint of satisfaction in resolving the land use issue and enabling the power project to proceed, but it's very subtle. There is no information to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
