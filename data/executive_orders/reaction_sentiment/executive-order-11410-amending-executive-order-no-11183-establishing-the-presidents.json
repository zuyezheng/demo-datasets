    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, primarily dealing with the appointment of a chairman to a commission. As such, it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The tone is formal and administrative. Initial scores are set to low values across all emotions, with a slight increase in surprise due to the nature of amendments. The critique suggests even lower scores, as the document is purely procedural and unlikely to elicit any significant emotional response.",
