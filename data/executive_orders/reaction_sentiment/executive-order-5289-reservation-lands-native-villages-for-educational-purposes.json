    "critique": "The document discusses reserving land for school buildings in Alaska. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of joy and perhaps a little surprise that the government is providing resources for education in Alaska. There might be a little sadness that the order is needed, but overall, the emotions are positive. Disgust, fear, and anger are not relevant in this context. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I will revise them slightly to better reflect the emphasis on joy and the minimal presence of other emotions.",
