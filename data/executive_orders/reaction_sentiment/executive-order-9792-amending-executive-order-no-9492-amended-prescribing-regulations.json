    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order regarding transportation regulations. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary goal is to ensure efficient and orderly transportation, not to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative, further suggesting a lack of emotional intent. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
