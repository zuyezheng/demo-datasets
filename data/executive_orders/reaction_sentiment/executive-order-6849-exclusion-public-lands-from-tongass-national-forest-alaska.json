    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land exclusion from a national forest. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to established procedures. There's no strong emotional appeal, but a sense of calm and trust in the government's process is desired. The language is formal and technical, focusing on precise descriptions and legal compliance. Therefore, the scores for most emotions should be low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for trust or a lack of fear/surprise.",
