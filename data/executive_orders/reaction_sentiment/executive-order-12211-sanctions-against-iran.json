    "critique": "The document is an executive order imposing further prohibitions on transactions with Iran. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are fear (from Iran and those supporting terrorism), and a sense of security and confidence (from the American people). The order aims to address threats to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. The tone is authoritative and decisive. I will score the emotions based on this understanding.",
