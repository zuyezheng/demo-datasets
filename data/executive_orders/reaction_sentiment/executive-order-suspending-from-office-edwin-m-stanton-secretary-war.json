    "critique": "The document is a formal order to suspend the Secretary of War. The tone is authoritative and decisive. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is perhaps surprise, but also a sense of order and control. There's a hint of sadness in having to take this action, but it's mostly about asserting authority. Disgust and fear are unlikely to be intended emotions. Joy is definitely not intended. Anger might be present, but it's controlled.",
