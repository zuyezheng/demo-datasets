    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the termination of the War Refugee Board. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely to be minimal. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong feelings. The tone is administrative and factual. However, there might be a subtle sense of closure or relief that the war is over and the board is no longer needed. Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document's purpose is purely administrative. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
