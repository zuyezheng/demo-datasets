As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the project is being handled efficiently and legally. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document, but rather a sense of authority and progress. The language is formal and factual, so I don't expect strong emotional reactions. I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
