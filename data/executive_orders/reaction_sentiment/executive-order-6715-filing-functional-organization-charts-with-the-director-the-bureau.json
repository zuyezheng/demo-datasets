As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of order, efficiency, and compliance. There isn't a strong emphasis on emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low intensities for most emotions.",
