    "critique": "The document establishes an Energy Coordinating Committee to improve communication and coordination among Executive agencies concerning energy policy and the management of energy resources. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and reassurance that the government is taking action to address energy issues. There is also an element of hope that the committee will lead to improvements in energy policy. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are joy: 5, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable. The document is intended to inspire confidence and a sense of order, but it is not particularly joyful or exciting. The level of surprise is low, as the creation of such a committee is not unexpected.",
