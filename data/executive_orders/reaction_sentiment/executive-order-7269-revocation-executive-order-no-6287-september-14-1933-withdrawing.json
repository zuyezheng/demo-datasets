    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in New Mexico. The tone is formal and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in governance. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not really relevant in this context. The document is purely administrative.",
