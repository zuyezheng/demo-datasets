As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in governance. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is purely administrative and factual. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a low intensity for all emotions.",
