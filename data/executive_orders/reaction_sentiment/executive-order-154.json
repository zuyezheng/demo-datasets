    "critique": "The document expresses a decision to allocate land for the Marine Hospital Service. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of joy and surprise that resources are being allocated to improve healthcare services. There might be a slight fear and sadness from those who had claims on the land, but this is mitigated by the exception clause. Disgust and anger are unlikely to be strong emotions elicited by this order.",
