    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the classification, safeguarding, and declassification of national security information. As the author, the President, I aim to elicit a sense of security and trust in the government's ability to protect sensitive information while also promoting transparency. The order seeks to balance these competing interests. The primary emotions I want to evoke are joy (related to transparency and openness), and a reduction of fear (related to national security). There may be some sadness related to the fact that some information must remain classified. There may be some surprise at the level of detail and the commitment to declassification. There should be minimal disgust or anger.",
