    "critique": "The document aims to establish an Office of Intergovernmental Relations to improve cooperation between federal, state, and local governments. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (through improved cooperation and problem-solving), and perhaps a reduction in fear or sadness related to intergovernmental issues. There's little to suggest anger, disgust, or surprise are intended emotions. The language is formal and bureaucratic, suggesting a focus on efficiency and order rather than strong emotional responses. The initial scores reflect this, with joy being the highest, and other emotions being relatively low. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable given the document's content and tone. However, I will adjust the joy score slightly upwards to reflect the positive intent of the order.",
