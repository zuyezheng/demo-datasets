As the President, my intention is to instill confidence and stability. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Joy would be minimal, as it's a procedural matter. Sadness is irrelevant. Anger is unlikely, unless someone is negatively affected by the changes in ranking. Fear is not intended. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise might be present if someone was expecting a different outcome, but it's not a primary goal. Revised scores reflect this.",
