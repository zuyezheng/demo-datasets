    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land within the Tule River Indian Reservation. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably not a strong one. The order is about land management, so I'll focus on neutral or slightly positive emotions like a sense of order or resolution. There's not much emotional language here, so most scores will be low. Joy would be low as it is unlikely that anyone would feel joy. Sadness would be low as it is unlikely that anyone would feel sadness. Anger would be low as it is unlikely that anyone would feel anger. Fear would be low as it is unlikely that anyone would feel fear. Disgust would be low as it is unlikely that anyone would feel disgust. Surprise would be low as it is unlikely that anyone would feel surprise.",
