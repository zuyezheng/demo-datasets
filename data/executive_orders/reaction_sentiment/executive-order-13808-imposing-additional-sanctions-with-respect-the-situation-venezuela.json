    "critique": "The document expresses concern over human rights abuses, humanitarian crisis, and corruption in Venezuela. The President aims to convey a sense of resolve and determination to address these issues through economic sanctions. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a mix of concern (sadness), resolve (joy), and perhaps a degree of fear in the Venezuelan government. Disgust at the actions of the Venezuelan government is also likely. Surprise is less relevant here, as the actions are a response to an existing situation. The initial scores reflect these considerations. After further review, I believe the intensity of sadness and disgust should be slightly higher to reflect the gravity of the situation described in the document.",
