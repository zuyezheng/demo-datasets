    "critique": "The document describes a specific case of appointing Mrs. Ida A. Coffey to a position in the Department of Commerce. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that Mrs. Coffey is being given this opportunity and sadness for the circumstances of her husband's illness and the family's dependence on her. There might be a slight element of surprise that such a specific case is being addressed by an executive order. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust.",
