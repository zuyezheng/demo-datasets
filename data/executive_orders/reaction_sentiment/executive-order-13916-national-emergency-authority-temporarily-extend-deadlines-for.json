    "critique": "The document focuses on invoking emergency authority and providing the Secretary of Treasury with additional authority to respond to the national emergency caused by COVID-19. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of reassurance and confidence that the government is taking action to address the crisis. There is also an element of fear related to the ongoing emergency, but the order aims to mitigate that fear by demonstrating a proactive response. There is little to no indication of joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise being conveyed or intended. The language is formal and legalistic, which further supports the intention of conveying a sense of control and authority.",
