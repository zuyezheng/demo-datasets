    "critique": "The document is primarily a legal description of land transfer. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in managing government assets. There's a desire to show that the government is responsive to the needs of the Territory of Hawaii while also maintaining necessary military readiness. There isn't a strong emotional component, so most scores will be low. Joy might be present in a small way as the territory benefits. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
