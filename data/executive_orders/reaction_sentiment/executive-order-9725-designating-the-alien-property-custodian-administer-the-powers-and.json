    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority to the Alien Property Custodian. The tone is legalistic and administrative. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the execution of the law and perhaps a sense of order and control. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, but perhaps a slight increase in confidence (related to joy) and a decrease in uncertainty (related to fear) is warranted. The revised scores reflect this subtle adjustment.",
