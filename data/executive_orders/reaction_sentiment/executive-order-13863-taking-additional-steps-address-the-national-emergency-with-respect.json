    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of decisive action against criminal organizations, primarily to reassure citizens and project strength. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of security (low fear), confidence (moderate joy), and perhaps a degree of satisfaction that action is being taken (moderate joy). There's also an element of disgust directed towards the criminal organizations themselves. Surprise is not a factor. Sadness is not a factor.",
