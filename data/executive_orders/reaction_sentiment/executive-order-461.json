The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of justice and perhaps fear in those considering rebellion. There's also an element of disgust towards the actions of the rebels. Joy is unlikely, and sadness is not the primary goal, though it might be a consequence. Surprise is not a major factor.",
