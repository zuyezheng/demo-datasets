    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding credit controls. The primary goal is to phase out these controls in an orderly fashion. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for a smooth transition. There's no explicit emotional appeal, but the implicit goal is to inspire confidence and stability in the financial system. Joy: The orderly phasing-out might bring a sense of relief and optimism, but it's not a strong emotion conveyed directly. Score: 3. Sadness: There's no indication of sadness. Score: 1. Anger: The document doesn't aim to provoke anger. Score: 1. Fear: The orderly phasing-out aims to reduce fear and uncertainty. Score: 2. Disgust: No disgust is conveyed. Score: 1. Surprise: The phasing-out might be expected, so surprise is low. Score: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
