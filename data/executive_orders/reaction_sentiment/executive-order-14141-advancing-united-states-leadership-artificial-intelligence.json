    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on AI infrastructure. As the President, I want to convey a sense of confidence, security, and progress. The primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (related to economic competitiveness and job creation), a sense of security (related to national security), and perhaps a touch of surprise at the scale and speed of the initiative. I want to minimize fear and disgust. Sadness is not really relevant here. Initial scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 1, Anger: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 5. Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable, but I might want to slightly increase the emphasis on joy and security, and further reduce fear and disgust. Revised scores:",
