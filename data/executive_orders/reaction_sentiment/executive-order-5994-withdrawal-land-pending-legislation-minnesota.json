There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. The tone is formal and legalistic. Joy would be low, as it's not a celebratory document. Sadness would be low, as it's not a lament. Anger would be low, as it's not an aggressive document. Fear would be low, as it's not meant to scare. Disgust would be low, as it's not repulsive. Surprise would be low, as it's a routine order.",
