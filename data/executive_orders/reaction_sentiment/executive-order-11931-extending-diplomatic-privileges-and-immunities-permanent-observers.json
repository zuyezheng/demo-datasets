The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and proper procedure, perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that international relations are being handled correctly. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as this seems to be a routine matter.
