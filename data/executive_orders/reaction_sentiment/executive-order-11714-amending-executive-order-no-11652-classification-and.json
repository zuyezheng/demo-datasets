    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order. It deals with the composition of the Interagency Classification Review Committee. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of order and control, perhaps tinged with a bit of reassurance that national security is being handled competently. There's not much room for strong emotions here. Joy is unlikely, as is sadness. Anger and disgust are irrelevant. Fear might be slightly reduced by the sense of control, and surprise is minimal since it's just an amendment.",
