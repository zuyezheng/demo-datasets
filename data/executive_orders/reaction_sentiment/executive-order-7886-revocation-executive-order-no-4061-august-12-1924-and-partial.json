    "critique": "The document is a revocation of previous executive orders regarding land resurveys in New Mexico. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of resolution and efficiency in land management. The tone is formal and administrative, suggesting a desire for order and clarity. There's no strong emotional language, so the scores should be relatively low. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is quite neutral. The aim is to efficiently manage land, not to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are appropriate.",
