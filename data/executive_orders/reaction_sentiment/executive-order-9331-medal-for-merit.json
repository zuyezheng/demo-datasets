    "critique": "The document describes the creation and regulation of the 'Medal for Merit'. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise for those receiving the award, and perhaps a sense of respect and gratitude from the general public. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this document. The language is formal and official, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Revised scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 4. I increased joy and surprise slightly to reflect the positive nature of the award.",
