As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy and perhaps a sense of closure or reconciliation. There might also be a hint of surprise at the gesture. There's no real indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust in this context. The tone is formal and administrative, not strongly emotional.",
