The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (from saving taxpayer money and responsible governance) and surprise (at the extent of the cost savings). There might be some sadness from the reduction of certain activities, and perhaps some fear or disgust at the previous levels of waste. The tone is serious and determined, not angry.",
