    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's content and tone. The document aims to restore order and enforce laws, which could evoke joy in some, sadness in others (especially those who supported the Confederacy), and perhaps fear or disgust in those resistant to the changes. Surprise is less prominent, as the actions are somewhat expected after the conflict. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity of these emotions based on a more nuanced reading.",
