    "critique": "The document is a simple administrative order transferring land between two national forests. The tone is formal and factual, with no emotional language. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are neutral. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions set to 1. Upon review, there's no basis to change these scores, as the document is purely administrative and devoid of emotional intent.",
