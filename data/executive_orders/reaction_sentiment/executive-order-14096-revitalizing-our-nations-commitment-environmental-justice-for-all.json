The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through improved living conditions and opportunities), hope (for a better future), and trust (in the government's commitment). However, the document also acknowledges past failures and ongoing challenges, which may evoke sadness and concern. The language is formal and determined, aiming to inspire confidence and action.",
