    "critique": "The document aims to address illegal activities like trafficking and tax evasion through e-commerce. The primary emotions the President would want to elicit are joy (for protecting citizens and businesses), and perhaps fear (in those who might be engaging in illegal activities). There might also be some anger directed at those who are violating the laws. Surprise is less relevant here, and sadness is also not a primary emotion being targeted. Disgust at the illegal activities is also a relevant emotion. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
