    "critique": "The document expresses respect and remembrance for fallen soldiers. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is sadness (for the loss) and perhaps a touch of joy (in honoring their memory). There might be a slight element of surprise that the President is allowing government employees to take time off, but it's not a strong emotion. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I'll slightly adjust them to better reflect the emphasis on sadness and respect.",
