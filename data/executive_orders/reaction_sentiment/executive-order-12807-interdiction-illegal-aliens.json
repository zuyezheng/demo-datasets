    "critique": "The document focuses on preventing illegal immigration by sea. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of security and order. I want the public to feel safe knowing that the borders are being protected and that illegal immigration is being addressed. There might be some sadness associated with the plight of those attempting to enter illegally, but the overall goal is to project strength and control. Surprise is not a major factor here, as the order is a continuation of existing policies. Disgust is not directly relevant, but there might be a subtle element of it towards those who break the law. Fear is also not a primary emotion, but there might be a slight sense of fear among those who are attempting to enter illegally.",
