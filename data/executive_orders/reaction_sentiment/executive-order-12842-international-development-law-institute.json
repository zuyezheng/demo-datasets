    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the International Development Law Institute as a public international organization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and adherence to international law. There is little to suggest strong emotions. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are likely low. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
