    "critique": "The document establishes a committee to monitor and enforce labor obligations of Canada and Mexico. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through ensuring fair labor practices) and perhaps surprise (at the comprehensive nature of the monitoring). There might be a degree of fear instilled in those who might violate the labor agreements. Sadness, disgust, and anger are less relevant in this context.",
