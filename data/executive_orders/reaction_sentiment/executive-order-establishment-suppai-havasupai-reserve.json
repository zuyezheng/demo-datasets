    "critique": "The document is an executive order that withdraws land from sale and settlement to set it apart for the Suppai Indians. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the Suppai Indians, and perhaps a sense of justice or fairness from the general public. There might be some sadness or anger from those who were hoping to purchase or settle on the land, but the overall tone is one of protection and preservation. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion, as such orders were not uncommon. Disgust and fear are not relevant in this context.",
