    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, dealing with the composition of the Federal Council for Science and Technology. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are minimal. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The actions are administrative and not designed to evoke strong emotional responses. Therefore, initial scores should be low across all emotions. Revised scores should reflect the same, with slight adjustments based on the critique.",
