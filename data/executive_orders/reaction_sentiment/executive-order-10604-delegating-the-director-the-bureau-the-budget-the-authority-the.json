    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority regarding operation of stands in Federal buildings by blind persons. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning properly and addressing the needs of its citizens, particularly the blind. There's a slight element of joy in enabling economic opportunities, but it's not the primary focus. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely.",
