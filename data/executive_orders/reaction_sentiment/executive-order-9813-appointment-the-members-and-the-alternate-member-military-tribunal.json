    "critique": "The document outlines the designation of members to military tribunals for the trial and punishment of major war criminals. The tone is formal and authoritative, reflecting the President's role and the gravity of the situation. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of justice, resolve, and perhaps a degree of satisfaction that war criminals are being held accountable. There's also an element of somberness given the context of war crimes. Joy is low, as the situation is serious. Sadness is moderate, reflecting the somber nature of war crimes. Anger is moderate, directed at the war criminals. Fear is low, as the document aims to establish order and justice. Disgust is moderate, related to the nature of the crimes. Surprise is low, as the establishment of tribunals is likely expected.",
