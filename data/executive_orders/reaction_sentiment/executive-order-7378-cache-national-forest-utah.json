    "critique": "The document is an executive order adding land to the Cache National Forest. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who value natural resources. There might be some sadness from those who lose access to the land for other purposes, but this is likely minimal. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not a primary goal. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion.",
