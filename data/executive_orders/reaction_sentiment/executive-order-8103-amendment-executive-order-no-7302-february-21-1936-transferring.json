As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's ability to manage resources effectively and strategically. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be low. Joy would be minimal, as it's a functional document. Sadness is not relevant. Anger is not the intention. Fear should be low, as the order is for a specific purpose. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise should be low, as it's an amendment to existing orders.",
