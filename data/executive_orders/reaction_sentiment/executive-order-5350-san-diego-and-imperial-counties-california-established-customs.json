    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a new customs collection district. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to manage customs and trade effectively. There's no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be low, but a slight sense of confidence and perhaps mild surprise at the reorganization might be present.
