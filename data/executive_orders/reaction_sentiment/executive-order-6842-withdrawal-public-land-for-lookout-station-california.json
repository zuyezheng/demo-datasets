    "critique": "The document is a straightforward legal order about land withdrawal for forest protection. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security related to forest protection. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy might be present in a subtle way from the idea of protecting nature. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems like a routine action.",
