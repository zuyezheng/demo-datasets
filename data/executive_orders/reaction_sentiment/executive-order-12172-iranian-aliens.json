    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of State and the Attorney General regarding the entry of Iranians holding nonimmigrant visas into the United States. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary goal is to ensure national security and manage immigration in a specific context. The language is precise and avoids emotional appeals. The context is the Iran hostage crisis, which adds an implicit sense of urgency and concern. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 3, Fear: 5, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 3. Critique: The initial scores reflect the formal and somewhat detached nature of the document, with a slight emphasis on fear due to the context of the Iran hostage crisis. However, the document itself doesn't explicitly express these emotions. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 4, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
