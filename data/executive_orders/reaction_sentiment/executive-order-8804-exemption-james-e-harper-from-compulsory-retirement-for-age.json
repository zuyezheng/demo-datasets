    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of an employee from compulsory retirement. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order, and perhaps a little surprise that such a specific case is being addressed at this level. There's no indication of strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
