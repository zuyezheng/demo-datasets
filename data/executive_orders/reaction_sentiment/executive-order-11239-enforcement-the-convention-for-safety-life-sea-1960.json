    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea. The primary goal is to ensure safety of life at sea. The tone is formal and legalistic. The document aims to convey a sense of responsibility and order. It is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The most relevant emotions are joy (related to safety), and perhaps a bit of surprise at the level of detail. Fear and disgust are unlikely. Sadness is also unlikely. The initial scores are therefore: joy: 5, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 3. Upon further reflection, the document is very procedural and unlikely to elicit much emotion at all. The revised scores are: joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2.",
