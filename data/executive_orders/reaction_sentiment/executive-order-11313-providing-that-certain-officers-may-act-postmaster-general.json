    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the line of succession for the office of Postmaster General. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to stability and order, not strong emotions like joy or sadness. The order aims to ensure the continuity of the Post Office operations. Therefore, the scores should reflect low levels of most emotions, with perhaps a slightly higher score for surprise if people were unaware of the previous line of succession.",
