As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of stability, competence, and judiciousness. The primary emotions I want to elicit are reassurance and confidence in my leadership. There is little to suggest strong emotions, so most scores will be low. Joy is not really present. Sadness is not present. Anger is not present. Fear is not present. Disgust is not present. Surprise is not present.",
