    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Edward M. Kennard from mandatory retirement. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in my leadership. The order itself is quite procedural. There is not enough information to determine the intensity of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise, so I will assign a default score of 1 to each of them. The tone is formal and legalistic, suggesting a focus on procedure and adherence to the law.",
