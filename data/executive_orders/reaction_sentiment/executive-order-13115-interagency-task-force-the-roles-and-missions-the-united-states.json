    "critique": "The document aims to instill confidence and assurance through a structured review of the Coast Guard's roles and missions. The primary emotion is a sense of security and efficiency. The language is formal and bureaucratic, suggesting a focus on process and order. There's an element of surprise in the comprehensive review, but it's tempered by the assurance that the Coast Guard will remain a law enforcement agency and an armed force. There is no anger, disgust, or sadness conveyed.",
