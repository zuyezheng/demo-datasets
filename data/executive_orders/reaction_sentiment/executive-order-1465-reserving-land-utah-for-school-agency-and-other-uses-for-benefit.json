The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the Indians who will benefit from this order. There might also be some surprise that the government is taking this action. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are joy: 7, surprise: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1. Upon further reflection, the order is fairly routine, so the joy and surprise should be lower. The revised scores are joy: 4, surprise: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1.",
