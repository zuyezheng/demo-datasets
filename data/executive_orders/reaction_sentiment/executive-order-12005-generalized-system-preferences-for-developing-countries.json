    "critique": "The document is an amendment to the Generalized System of Preferences. As such, it is a technical document that does not explicitly convey any strong emotions. The primary goal is to enact a change in trade policy. The tone is formal and legalistic. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of joy for those who benefit from the amendment and a slight sense of sadness or anger for those who are negatively affected. Surprise is unlikely, and disgust is not applicable. After further consideration, the initial assessment seems accurate. The revised scores will remain low, with a slight increase in joy to reflect the intended positive outcome for some.",
