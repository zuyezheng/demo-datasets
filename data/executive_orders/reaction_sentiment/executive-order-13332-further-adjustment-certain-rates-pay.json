    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order adjusting pay scales for various government employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and order. There's not much room for strong emotions like joy or sadness in such a document. The tone is very neutral and factual. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Surprise, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. A slight sense of satisfaction (joy) might be present for those receiving pay increases, but it's minimal. There's no indication of sadness or anger. The document aims for a sense of calm and routine governance.",
