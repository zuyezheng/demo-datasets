    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding international cultural exchange and trade fairs. The language is formal and legalistic. The actions described are administrative and procedural, dealing with the allocation of funds and delegation of responsibilities. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal seems to be clarity and efficiency in the administration of the Act. Therefore, the emotions elicited are likely to be minimal. I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for surprise, as the changes might cause some minor adjustments in the involved agencies.",
