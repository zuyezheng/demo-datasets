    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a dispute between the United Transportation Union and certain railroads. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly and to prevent disruption of essential transportation services. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for neutrality and objectivity. There's an element of preventing fear and anger by ensuring continued service and a structured resolution process. There is very little to suggest any joy. There is a sense of sadness that the dispute has occurred, but it is very low. There is no surprise intended. The initial scores are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 3, Fear: 4, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will adjust the fear score slightly downward as the order is more about preventing disruption than directly addressing a fearful situation. The final scores are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 3, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
