    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation as a public international organization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in international cooperation. There is no explicit mention of emotions. The actions are related to economic cooperation, so I will score joy, surprise, and fear as low. I will score sadness and disgust as 1 since they are not relevant. I will score joy as 3, surprise as 2, and fear as 2. The initial scores are joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 2, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. After further consideration, I think the joy score should be slightly higher to reflect the positive aspect of international cooperation. The surprise and fear scores should remain low as the document is primarily a formal designation.",
