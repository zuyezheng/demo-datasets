    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land in Alaska. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in managing public lands. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The actions are administrative and don't inherently evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
