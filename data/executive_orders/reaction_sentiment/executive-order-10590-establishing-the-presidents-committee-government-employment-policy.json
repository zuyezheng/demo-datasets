    "critique": "The document aims to promote equal opportunity and prohibit discrimination in Federal Government employment. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from those who will benefit from these policies, and perhaps a sense of reassurance and reduced fear among those who might have felt vulnerable to discrimination. There might be some sadness from those who previously benefited from discriminatory practices, but this is likely unintended. Surprise is not a major factor, as the order builds upon existing policies. Disgust and anger are likely directed at the previous discriminatory practices, which the order seeks to correct.",
