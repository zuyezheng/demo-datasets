    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax returns and their inspection by a congressional committee. The tone is official and procedural. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is likely a sense of compliance and adherence to the law, rather than strong emotions like joy or sadness. The document focuses on legal authority and specific acts, suggesting a desire for order and transparency in government operations. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low levels of most emotions, with perhaps a slightly higher emphasis on reducing fear or uncertainty by clarifying the legal basis for the action.",
