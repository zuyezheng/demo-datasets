The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to address campaign finance issues. There is a hint of hope that the commission will find solutions. There is little to suggest strong emotions like anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
