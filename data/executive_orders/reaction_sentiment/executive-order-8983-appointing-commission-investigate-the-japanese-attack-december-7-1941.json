    "critique": "The document aims to investigate the Pearl Harbor attack. As the President, I want to convey a sense of seriousness and determination to find the truth. I want to elicit a sense of trust and confidence that I am taking appropriate action. There might be some sadness related to the attack, but the primary focus is on investigation and accountability. There might be a little surprise that such an attack could occur. The tone is formal and official, which suggests a desire to project authority and control. The language is precise and legalistic, which reinforces the seriousness of the inquiry. The context is a nation reeling from a surprise attack, so the response needs to be measured and decisive.",
