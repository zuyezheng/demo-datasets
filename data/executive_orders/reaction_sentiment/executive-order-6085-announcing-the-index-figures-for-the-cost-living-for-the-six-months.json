    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context of the document. The document is primarily about reducing compensation, which would likely elicit sadness and perhaps some fear or disgust. There's not much to suggest joy or surprise. The tone is formal and factual, so anger is probably not a strong emotion here. However, upon further reflection, the reduction in compensation might also elicit some anger, so I will increase the anger score slightly.",
