    "critique": "The document is a short executive order regarding the appointment of Harold Ambrose to a classified position in the Post Office Department. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low across the board, with perhaps a slightly higher score for order/joy due to the action being taken.",
