    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on continuing or terminating advisory committees. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order. There's a focus on efficiency by terminating committees that have completed their work. Joy is minimal, as it's a procedural document. Sadness is also minimal, though some might feel a loss with terminated committees. Anger is unlikely, as the changes seem administrative. Fear is low, as the document doesn't suggest any immediate threats. Disgust is irrelevant. Surprise is also low, as these types of orders are common. Revised scores reflect this.",
