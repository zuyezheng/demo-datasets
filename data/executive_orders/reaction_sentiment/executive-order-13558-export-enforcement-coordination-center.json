    "critique": "The document focuses on national security and foreign policy goals through export controls. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (through strengthened security) and perhaps a reduction in fear (by addressing potential threats). There might be a sense of surprise at the level of coordination being established. Sadness, anger, and disgust are less relevant in this context, so they should be scored lower. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I'll adjust them slightly to better reflect the emphasis on joy and reduced fear.",
