    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding disaster relief. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (relief and hope) and a reduction of fear (assurance that the government is prepared). There might be a slight element of surprise at the extent of the order, but it's not a primary goal. There's no indication of anger, sadness, or disgust being intentionally conveyed. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
