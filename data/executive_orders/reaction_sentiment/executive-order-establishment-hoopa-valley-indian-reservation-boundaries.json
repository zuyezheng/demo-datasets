    "critique": "The document describes the establishment of boundaries for the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation and the withdrawal of land from public sale for Indian purposes. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of joy and perhaps surprise among the Native American population, and a sense of justice and satisfaction among those who support Native American rights. There might also be a degree of sadness for the loss of potential revenue from public sale of the land, and perhaps some disgust or anger from those who oppose the reservation. However, the overall tone is formal and administrative, so the intensity of these emotions is likely to be moderate.",
