    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the USMBHC as a public international organization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order. There is little to suggest strong emotions. The designation is intended to provide certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. The language is neutral and factual. Therefore, the initial scores are all low.",
