The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction that this situation is resolved. There isn't much emotional language here, so most scores will be low. Joy might be present because the situation is resolved, but it's not a strong emotion. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be present. Surprise might be present, but it's also unlikely to be a strong emotion.",
