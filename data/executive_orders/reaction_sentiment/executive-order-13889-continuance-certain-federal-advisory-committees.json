    "critique": "The document is a continuation of existing advisory committees. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy that things are continuing as they were, and perhaps a mild sense of relief that there are no major changes. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong feelings.",
