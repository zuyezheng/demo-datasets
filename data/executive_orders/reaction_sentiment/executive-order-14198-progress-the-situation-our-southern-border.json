    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. The document aims to convey a sense of decisive action (reducing fear/surprise) while also acknowledging the need for cooperation (some joy). The potential for tariffs suggests a degree of anger/disgust towards the problem, and sadness at the situation. The revised scores slightly adjust the emphasis based on a more careful reading, increasing the 'fear' score to reflect the underlying threat and the 'disgust' score to reflect the administration's stance on the drug/human trafficking.",
