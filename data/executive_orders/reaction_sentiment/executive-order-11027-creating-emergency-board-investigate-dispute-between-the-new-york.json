    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a dispute between railroad companies and their employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly and fairly. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of control and resolution. There's an element of hope that the board's investigation will lead to a solution, but also a potential for disappointment if the dispute remains unresolved. The emotions I want to convey are not strong, but rather moderate and balanced. The initial scores reflect this, with joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all being relatively low. Upon review, I think the initial scores are a good representation of the emotions conveyed in the document.",
