The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for those receiving the medal and perhaps a sense of pride and encouragement for others. There might be a slight element of surprise for those unaware of the medal, but overall, the tone is formal and focused on recognition. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
