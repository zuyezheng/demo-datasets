    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order regarding civil service retirement benefits for employees with emergency-indefinite appointments. The tone is formal and legalistic. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are minimal. There's no intention to evoke strong feelings. The actions are administrative and procedural. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, but perhaps a slight sense of reassurance or stability could be inferred, so I will adjust joy slightly upward. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
