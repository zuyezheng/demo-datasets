The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for a healthier environment and efficient government), and perhaps a bit of surprise (at the progress made). There might be a slight element of fear reduction (related to toxic chemicals), and a reduction in disgust (related to pollution). Sadness and anger are not emotions the President is trying to elicit.",
