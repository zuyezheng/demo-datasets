    "critique": "The document aims to evoke feelings of joy, pride, and patriotism in American citizens by preserving the White House as a symbol of democracy and national heritage. The language used emphasizes the historical significance and public accessibility of the White House, intending to inspire a sense of ownership and connection among Americans. The establishment of a committee and the appointment of a curator further reinforce the commitment to preserving this national treasure. The document does not seem to elicit negative emotions such as sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a primary emotion conveyed, as the actions are presented as a natural continuation of existing efforts.",
