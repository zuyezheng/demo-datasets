    "critique": "The document is an executive order about land withdrawal in New Mexico. As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of stability, order, and progress. The primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and trust in the government's ability to manage resources and support the state of New Mexico. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy might be present in a small way, as this aids New Mexico. There is no explicit sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as this is a routine action.",
