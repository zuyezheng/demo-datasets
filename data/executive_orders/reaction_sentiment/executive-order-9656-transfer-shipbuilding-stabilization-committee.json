    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the transfer of the Shipbuilding Stabilization Committee to the Department of Labor. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order, not strong emotions. The language is legalistic and focused on the mechanics of the transfer. There is a slight sense of reassurance that prior regulations will remain in effect. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
