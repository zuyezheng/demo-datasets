    "critique": "The document aims to establish an interagency group to address policies concerning Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (through improved policies and attention to these areas) and surprise (by taking action). There might be a slight element of sadness addressed by the policies, but it's not a primary focus. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust being intentionally conveyed. The language is formal and bureaucratic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression.",
