    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding reimbursement of Federal, State, and city income taxes for travel, transportation, and relocation expenses of employees. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to stability, order, and trust in government processes. There is no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with slight emphasis on reducing fear and surprise by clarifying procedures. The revised scores slightly increase the emphasis on reducing fear and surprise, and maintaining a low level of sadness and disgust, while keeping joy minimal.",
