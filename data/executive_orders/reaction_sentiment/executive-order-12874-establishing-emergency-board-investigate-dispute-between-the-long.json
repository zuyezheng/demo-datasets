    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and stability, assuring the public that the situation is being handled responsibly and according to established legal procedures. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is neutral and procedural, aiming for a sense of order and control. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low intensity across all emotions.",
