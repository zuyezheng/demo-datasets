    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the death of Vice-President Henry Wilson and instructions for naval honors. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is sadness and respect for the deceased. There might also be a sense of surprise at the sudden death, but the main focus is on mourning. There is no intention to elicit joy, anger, fear, or disgust.The initial scores reflect these considerations. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, but I will slightly adjust the surprise score to reflect the unexpected nature of the announcement.",
