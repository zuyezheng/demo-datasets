    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the promotion of officers in the Navy. The tone is official and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotions. The primary goal is to enact a change in procedure, not to elicit a specific emotional response. However, one could infer a slight sense of satisfaction or relief that a necessary adjustment is being made. Given the limited emotional content, most scores should be low. Joy, surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness are likely minimal. A slight sense of satisfaction might translate to a low joy score.",
