    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in governance, not strong emotions. The actions are administrative, so strong emotions are unlikely. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Critique: The initial scores reflect the lack of emotional content. Revised scores should remain the same as there's no basis for change.",
