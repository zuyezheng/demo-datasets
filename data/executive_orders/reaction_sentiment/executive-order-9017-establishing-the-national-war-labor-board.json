The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security that the war effort will not be hampered by internal conflicts. There's also an element of hope that disputes can be resolved peacefully. Fear and disgust are less relevant, as the document focuses on resolution rather than instilling those emotions. Surprise is also not a primary goal.",
