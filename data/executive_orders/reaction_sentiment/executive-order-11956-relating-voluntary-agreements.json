    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, delegating authority related to the Defense Production Act. The language is formal and legalistic. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are related to confidence in the functioning of government and perhaps a sense of stability. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as amendments are generally expected. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
