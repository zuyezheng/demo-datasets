    "critique": "The document aims to establish a wildlife refuge and breeding ground. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (in preserving wildlife), and perhaps a touch of surprise (at the creation of the refuge). There might be a small element of sadness if people are restricted from accessing the land as they previously did, and potentially disgust and anger from those who disagree with the order. Fear is unlikely to be a significant emotion elicited by this document. The initial scores are based on this assessment.\n\nRevised scores:\nAfter further consideration, the element of surprise is probably not as strong as initially thought. The focus is more on the positive emotions associated with conservation. The negative emotions are likely minimal, as the order seems fairly straightforward and limited in scope.",
