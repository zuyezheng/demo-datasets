    "critique": "The President likely wants to instill a sense of joy and confidence in the American people by ensuring accountability and a unified execution of federal law. There might be a slight element of surprise as the President takes decisive action to address the perceived lack of supervision over regulatory agencies. There could be a degree of fear and disgust directed towards the previous administrations' practices that allowed independent regulatory agencies to operate with minimal Presidential supervision. There is likely a degree of sadness that the previous administrations allowed this to happen. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
