    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding a personnel appointment. The tone is official and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and proper procedure, not strong emotions. The actions are routine, so surprise should be low. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Joy is also unlikely to be a primary goal, but perhaps a sense of satisfaction that things are running smoothly.",
