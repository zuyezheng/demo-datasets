    "critique": "The document is an executive order adding land to the Wasatch National Forest. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who value natural resources. There might be some sadness from those who wanted to use the land for other purposes, but the overall tone is positive and focused on preservation. There is no anger, fear, or disgust evident in the document. Surprise is possible, but not a primary emotion.",
