    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order that abolishes a commission. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to a sense of order, efficiency, and decisiveness. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be low, but I will try to infer based on the actions taken. The actions are decisive, so I will give a slightly higher score to joy. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust, so those will be scored as 1. There is a slight element of surprise, so I will give that a 2.",
