    "critique": "The document outlines a special rule for appointments within the Pension Office, emphasizing adherence to civil service regulations and equitable apportionment. As the President, my primary goal is to convey a sense of order, fairness, and efficiency in governance. The language is formal and procedural, aiming to instill confidence in the merit-based system. There is an element of surprise that such a rule is being enacted. The emotions I want to elicit are joy that the system is fair, and reduced fear that the system is corrupt. Disgust and anger should be reduced as well. Sadness should be low, and surprise should be moderate.",
