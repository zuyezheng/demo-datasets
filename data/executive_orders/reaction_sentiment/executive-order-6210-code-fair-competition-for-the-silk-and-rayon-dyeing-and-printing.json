    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Silk and Rayon Dyeing and Printing Industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the economy through government action. There is a hint of joy that the industry and government are working together. There is a sense of fear that the order could be cancelled. There is a sense of disgust that some of the articles are ineffective. There is a sense of surprise that the order is subject to cancellation.",
