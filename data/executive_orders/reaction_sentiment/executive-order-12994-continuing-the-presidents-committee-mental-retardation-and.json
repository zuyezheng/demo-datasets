    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing and continuing a committee to address mental retardation. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through improved quality of life and community participation), and perhaps a sense of surprise at the comprehensive nature of the order. There might be a touch of sadness acknowledged due to the challenges faced by individuals with mental retardation, but the overall tone is positive and forward-looking. Fear, disgust, and anger are unlikely to be intended emotions.",
