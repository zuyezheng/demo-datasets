    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding customs ports in Alaska. The tone is official and procedural. The primary goal is administrative, not to evoke strong emotions. Joy: The order might bring some joy to the residents of Fairbanks due to the new designation, but it's likely minimal. Sadness: Residents of the discontinued port might feel some sadness, but again, it's likely not a strong emotion. Anger: Unlikely, unless there are strong local political issues not evident in the text. Fear: No indication of fear. Disgust: No indication of disgust. Surprise: The order might be a surprise to some, but not dramatically so. Given the lack of strong emotional indicators, most scores should be low.",
