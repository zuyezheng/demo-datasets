    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on delegating authority related to arms export control. The language is legalistic and procedural. As such, it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is efficiency and legal compliance, not emotional response. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of 'surprise' that such a detailed order is being issued, but even that is minimal. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
