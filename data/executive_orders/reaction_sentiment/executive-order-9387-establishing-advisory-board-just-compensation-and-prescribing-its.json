The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of fairness and trust in the government's handling of the situation. The tone is formal and authoritative, emphasizing the legal basis for the actions and the establishment of an impartial board to oversee the compensation process. The language is carefully chosen to convey a sense of order and control, minimizing potential anxieties about the requisitioning of private property. The President also wants to convey a sense of resolve and determination to win the war, which requires the full utilization of shipping facilities.
