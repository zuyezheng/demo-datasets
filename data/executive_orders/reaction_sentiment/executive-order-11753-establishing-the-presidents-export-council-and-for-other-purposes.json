    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing an Export Council to promote export expansion. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through economic growth and success) and perhaps a sense of confidence or reduced fear about the economy. There's no indication of sadness, anger, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely to be a major factor. The language is formal and bureaucratic, which doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
