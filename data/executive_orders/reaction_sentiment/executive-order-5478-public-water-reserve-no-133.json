There's no explicit emotional appeal, but an implicit sense of duty and perhaps a touch of reassurance that public lands are being managed. Joy would be low, as it's not a celebratory announcement. Sadness is irrelevant. Anger is not intended. Fear should be low, as the action is routine. Disgust is not applicable. Surprise should also be low, as such orders are expected. Revised scores reflect this more nuanced understanding.",
