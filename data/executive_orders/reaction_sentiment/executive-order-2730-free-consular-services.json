As the President, I aim to elicit joy and gratitude from the military personnel and their families, and perhaps a sense of surprise at the unexpected benefit. There might be a slight element of sadness related to the ongoing war, but the primary focus is on providing relief and support. Disgust, fear, and anger are not intended emotions.",
