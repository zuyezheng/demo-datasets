    "critique": "The document discusses amendments to civil service rules regarding temporary employees in the National Park Service. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in managing the National Park Service workforce. There's a slight element of reassurance that appointments will be made from registers of eligibles, suggesting fairness. There is not enough information to suggest the elicitation of other emotions, so I will score them as 1.",
