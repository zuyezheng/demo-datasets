    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a labor dispute in the railway industry. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly and effectively to avoid disruption of essential transportation services. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for neutrality and objectivity. There's an implicit desire to convey a sense of authority and control, but not in an overtly emotional way. The emotions of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust and surprise are scored on a scale of 1-10.",
