As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for the preservation of nature), and perhaps a bit of surprise (at the swift action). There might be a little sadness for those who can no longer settle on the land, but overall, the goal is positive. The language is formal and legalistic, so strong emotions are unlikely.
