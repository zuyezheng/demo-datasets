As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources effectively. There's no strong emotional language used, so the scores should be relatively low. Joy might be present in a small way, as the Department of Agriculture benefits. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as this seems like a routine administrative action. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1",
