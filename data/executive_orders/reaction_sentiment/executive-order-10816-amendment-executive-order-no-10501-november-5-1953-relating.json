    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on amending existing executive orders related to national security and classified information. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming to ensure the safeguarding of official information and control access to classified defense information. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are reassurance (that national security is being taken seriously) and trust (that the government is handling sensitive information responsibly). There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The changes are incremental and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotional responses. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on reassurance and trust.",
