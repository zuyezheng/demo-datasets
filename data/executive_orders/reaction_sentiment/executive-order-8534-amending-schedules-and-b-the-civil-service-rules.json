    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending civil service rules. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are trust, confidence, and a sense of order. The document is very technical and specific, so strong emotions are not the goal. I want to convey a sense of competence and control. The language is formal and legalistic, which further reinforces the sense of order and authority. I will start with initial scores and then revise them after further consideration.",
