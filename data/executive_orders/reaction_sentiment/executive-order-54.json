    "critique": "The document is a short statement about appointing Mrs. G. W. Shipman as a clerk. The tone is neutral and factual. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion the President wants to elicit. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or approval for making an appointment, but it's very subtle. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for joy or surprise that the appointment was made.",
