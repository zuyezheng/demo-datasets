    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of Ronald Ransom as Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and stability in the financial system. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so I will have to infer them from the context. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are not directly conveyed. The appointment is likely intended to inspire confidence (related to joy) and reduce fear about the economy. However, the impact is likely minimal, so I will assign low scores. There is no indication of sadness, anger, disgust, or surprise.",
