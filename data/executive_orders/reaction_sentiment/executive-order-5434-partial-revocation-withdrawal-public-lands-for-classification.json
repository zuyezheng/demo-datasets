The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy from the ex-servicemen who now have an opportunity to acquire land. There might be a sense of hope and opportunity conveyed. There isn't a strong sense of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not a primary emotion.",
