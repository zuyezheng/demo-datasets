    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation for Navajo Indians. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the Navajo Indians and perhaps a sense of fairness or justice from the general public. There might be some sadness or anger from those who had prior claims to the land, but the order explicitly states it is subject to prior valid rights. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion. Disgust and fear are not relevant in this context. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
