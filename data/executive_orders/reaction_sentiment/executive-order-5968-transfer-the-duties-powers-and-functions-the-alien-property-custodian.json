    "critique": "The document focuses on government efficiency and consolidation. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through increased efficiency) and perhaps a reduction in fear/anxiety about government overspending. There's not much sadness, anger, disgust, or surprise intended. The initial scores reflect this, but I'll revise them to better emphasize the intended joy and de-emphasize the other emotions based on the document's content and purpose.",
