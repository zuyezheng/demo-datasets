    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on revoking and amending a previous executive order. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary goal is to ensure the continuity of government and national security. The language is precise and avoids emotional appeals. As such, the emotions being conveyed are minimal. The revocation of sections might elicit a slight sense of surprise or perhaps relief in some parties, but overall, the document is intended to be neutral in tone. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with low values for all emotions.",
