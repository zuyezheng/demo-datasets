The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from businesses and citizens due to reduced costs and increased efficiency. There might be some sadness from those who benefit from the existing regulations. There could be fear from those who are used to the old system and are afraid of change. There might be disgust from those who disagree with the policy. There might be surprise from those who did not expect such a change. The initial scores are based on this analysis.",
