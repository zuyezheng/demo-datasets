    "critique": "The document is a revocation of previous executive orders regarding Public Water Reserves in California and Oregon. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably a sense of resolution or efficiency in managing public lands. There's not a lot of emotional language here, so most scores will be low. Joy might be present in a very mild form, as the order could be seen as resolving an issue. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems like a routine administrative action.",
