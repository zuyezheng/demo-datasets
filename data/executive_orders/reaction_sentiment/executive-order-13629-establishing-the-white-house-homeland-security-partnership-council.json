    "critique": "The document aims to foster collaboration and improve homeland security. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (or a sense of security and well-being) and perhaps a bit of surprise at the innovative approach. Fear and sadness should be minimized. Disgust is unlikely to be relevant. The initial scores reflect this, but I'll revise them slightly to emphasize the positive emotions and de-emphasize the negative ones further.",
