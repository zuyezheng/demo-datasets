As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the project is being handled efficiently and legally. However, the document itself is quite dry and technical, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, most scores should be low. There might be a slight sense of surprise due to the specific nature of the order, but overall, the emotional intensity is low.",
