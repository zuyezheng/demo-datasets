    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of resolution and efficiency in managing public lands. The order itself is quite dry and bureaucratic, so strong emotions are unlikely. Joy might be present for those gaining access to the land, but it's not explicitly intended. Sadness might be felt by the Chippewa Indians, but the order doesn't dwell on this. Anger is possible from those opposing the decision, but again, not explicitly intended. Fear and disgust are unlikely to be relevant. Surprise is possible if the order was unexpected. Given the limited emotional cues, the initial scores are likely to be low across the board. Upon further reflection, the order seems more neutral than anything else. The revised scores should reflect this.",
