    "critique": "The document expresses strong condemnation of the Zimbabwe government's actions, aiming to evoke feelings of disgust and anger towards their undemocratic practices and human rights abuses. It also intends to instill a sense of fear in those who might be complicit in these actions, as their assets will be blocked. The document also aims to convey a sense of joy to those who support democracy and human rights, as the US is taking action to address the situation. Surprise is not a primary emotion being conveyed, as the document builds upon previous executive orders. Sadness is present due to the human rights abuses, but it is not the primary focus.",
