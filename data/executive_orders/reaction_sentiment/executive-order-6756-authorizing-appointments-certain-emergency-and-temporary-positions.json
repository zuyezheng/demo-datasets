    "critique": "The document discusses appointments to positions without regard to civil-service rules to carry out provisions of certain acts. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and efficiency in addressing the emergency. There is a slight element of surprise that such measures are needed, but overall, the emphasis is on decisive action. Initial assessment: Joy: 6, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 4. Upon further reflection, the document is more about practicality and efficiency than joy. The surprise element is also minimal. Revised assessment: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
