    "critique": "The document is a General Order from the Navy Department regarding the death of ex-President Franklin Pierce. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is sadness and respect for the deceased. There might be a sense of surprise at the announcement, but the overall tone is somber and respectful. The actions, such as firing guns, lowering flags, and wearing mourning badges, all contribute to this atmosphere.I will start with initial scores and then revise them after a step-by-step critique.",
