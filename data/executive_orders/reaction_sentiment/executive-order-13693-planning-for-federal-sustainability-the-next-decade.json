    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (from a cleaner environment and a more sustainable future), and perhaps a sense of hope and optimism. There might be a slight element of fear regarding the potential impacts of climate change if action is not taken, but the overall tone is positive and proactive. There is no anger or disgust conveyed in the document. Surprise is not a major factor, as the order builds upon existing policies.",
