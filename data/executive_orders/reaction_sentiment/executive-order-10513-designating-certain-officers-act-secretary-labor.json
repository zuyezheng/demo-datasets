    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the line of succession for the Secretary of Labor. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to stability and order, not strong emotions like joy or sadness. The document aims to inspire confidence in the continuity of government operations. Therefore, the scores should reflect low levels of most emotions, with perhaps a slightly higher score for surprise due to the superseding of a previous order.",
