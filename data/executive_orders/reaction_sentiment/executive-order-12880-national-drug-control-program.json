The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are joy (through the promise of a safer nation), and a reduction in fear (related to drug-related crime and instability). There might be a degree of surprise at the comprehensive nature of the strategy. There isn't much to suggest sadness, anger, or disgust. The initial scores reflect these considerations. The revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the relative intensity of each emotion based on the document's content and tone.",
