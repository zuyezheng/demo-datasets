    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the establishment and amendment of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are likely joy (for women being given the opportunity to serve) and perhaps a sense of surprise (at the scale of the initiative). There might also be a degree of sadness (due to the context of war), but it's not the primary focus. Fear, disgust, and anger are unlikely to be intended emotions. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
