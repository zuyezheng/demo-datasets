The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through ensuring public safety and well-being), and a sense of reduced fear (by addressing radiation protection). There might be a slight element of surprise at the comprehensive nature of the council. Sadness, anger, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
