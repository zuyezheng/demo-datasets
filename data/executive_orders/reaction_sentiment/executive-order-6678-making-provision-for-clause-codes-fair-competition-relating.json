    "critique": "The document outlines an executive order related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (through economic recovery and fair competition), and a sense of reduced fear (through stability and regulation). There might be some sadness due to the acknowledgement of the current economic situation, and potentially some surprise at the extent of the intervention. Disgust and anger are less relevant in the intended emotional response. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon further reflection, the element of surprise is minimal, and the emphasis on joy should be slightly higher to reflect the hope for economic recovery.",
