    "critique": "The document describes the approval of the Environmental Protection Agency's seal. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy or satisfaction that the agency has an official seal, and perhaps a sense of pride in the agency's mission. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as this is a routine administrative matter. Initial scores: joy=5, sadness=1, anger=1, fear=1, disgust=1, surprise=1. Revised scores: joy=6, sadness=1, anger=1, fear=1, disgust=1, surprise=1. The joy score is slightly increased to reflect the positive tone associated with approving the seal.",
