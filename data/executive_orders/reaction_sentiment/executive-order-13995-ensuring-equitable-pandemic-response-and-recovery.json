    "critique": "The document aims to address health inequities exacerbated by COVID-19, particularly affecting communities of color and underserved populations. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through equitable access to resources and improved outcomes), and reduced fear and sadness (by mitigating the disproportionate impact of the pandemic). There's also an element of surprise intended, as the administration takes swift action to remedy these differences. Disgust is present due to the systemic racism and inequities, and a desire to reduce anger by addressing the issues. The initial scores reflect these intentions, but the revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the emphasis on joy and reduced negative emotions.",
