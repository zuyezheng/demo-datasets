    "critique": "The document aims to establish a War Production Board to ensure the most effective prosecution of war procurement and production. As the President, I want to convey a sense of confidence, determination, and control. The primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (that the war effort is being organized effectively), a reduction in fear (that the war effort is not coordinated), and a sense of surprise (that the government is acting swiftly and decisively). There is no information about anger, disgust, or sadness, so those will be scored as 1.",
