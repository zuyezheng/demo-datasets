    "critique": "The document is a revocation of an executive order regarding land in Oregon. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably a sense of resolution or perhaps satisfaction that an outdated order is being corrected. However, the document is very dry and factual. It's hard to infer strong emotions from it. The strongest emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or perhaps a lack of surprise that such an action is being taken. It's unlikely to evoke strong feelings of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
