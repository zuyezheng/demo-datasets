    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing a threat to national security. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely fear (in potential adversaries), and a sense of security and confidence (in the American public). The language is formal and authoritative, emphasizing the legal basis for the actions. The document highlights the threat posed by Syria's actions, which contributes to the emotion of fear. The actions taken are intended to project strength and resolve, which should inspire confidence. There is also an element of disgust towards the actions of the Syrian government. Surprise is less relevant, as the document is a formal declaration of policy. Sadness is also not a primary emotion being conveyed.",
