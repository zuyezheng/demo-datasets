The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably joy from the employee and perhaps a sense of stability or lack of surprise from the public. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, with joy being the highest and the others being low. The revised scores slightly adjust the joy downward and surprise upward to better reflect the likely public reaction.",
