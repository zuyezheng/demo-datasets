    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation for homeless Paiute or other Indians. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for the beneficiaries), and perhaps a reduction in sadness and fear among those who are homeless. There might be some surprise at the action, and potentially some disgust or anger from those who might see this as infringing on their rights, though the order attempts to mitigate this with the clause about existing rights. The tone is formal and legalistic, which doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion, but the action itself is intended to provide relief and opportunity.",
