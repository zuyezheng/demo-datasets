The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order, with perhaps a touch of gratitude from the individual being exempted. There's no indication of strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems to be a routine administrative matter.",
