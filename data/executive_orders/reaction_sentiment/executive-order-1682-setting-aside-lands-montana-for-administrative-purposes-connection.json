    "critique": "The document is a land withdrawal for administrative purposes related to the Flathead Indians. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps mild surprise that action is being taken. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of any emotion is likely to be low, given the specific and limited nature of the order.",
