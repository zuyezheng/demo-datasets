    "critique": "The document is a formal order about land withdrawal for resurvey. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning properly and managing resources responsibly. There isn't a strong emphasis on any particular emotion like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is neutral and administrative. Therefore, most scores should be low, with perhaps a slight emphasis on confidence which translates to low surprise and fear.",
