    "critique": "The document expresses sorrow and directs honors for Winfield Scott's death. The primary emotion is sadness, with some respect (potentially joy for his service, but less prominent). There's no explicit anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, so those should be low. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I'll slightly adjust them to better reflect the emphasis on sadness and respect.",
