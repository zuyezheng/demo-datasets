    "critique": "The document aims to address a crisis in Cote d'Ivoire, focusing on national security and foreign policy. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of security and perhaps a degree of hope that the situation can be improved. There's also an element of concern conveyed regarding the human rights abuses and violence. The tone is serious and authoritative, reflecting the gravity of the situation and the decisive action being taken. The language is formal and legalistic, emphasizing the official nature of the order. The context is one of international crisis and the need for intervention to protect U.S. interests and address humanitarian concerns. The initial scores are based on this analysis.",
