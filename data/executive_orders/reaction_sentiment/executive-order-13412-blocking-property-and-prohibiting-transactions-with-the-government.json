    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. The document aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination to address the situation in Sudan, which aligns with the scores for sadness, fear, and disgust. The joy score is appropriately low, as the document doesn't aim to evoke happiness. Surprise is also low, as the actions are presented as a continuation of existing policies. However, the fear score could be slightly higher to reflect the concern for national security.",
