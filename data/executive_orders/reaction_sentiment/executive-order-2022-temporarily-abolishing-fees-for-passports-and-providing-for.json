    "critique": "The document focuses on waiving fees for passports and visas. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy or relief from the public, especially those who need these services. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the unexpected waiver. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity is relatively low as it's a bureaucratic change, not a major policy shift.",
