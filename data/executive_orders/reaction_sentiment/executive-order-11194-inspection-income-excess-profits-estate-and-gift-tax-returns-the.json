    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections by a Senate committee. The tone is official and procedural. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is trust and confidence in the government's operations, economy, and efficiency. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The order aims for transparency and accountability. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust should be low. Surprise might be slightly higher as it involves making information accessible.",
