    "critique": "The document describes the presentation of captured rebel flags to Congress. As the President, I would want to elicit a sense of joy and surprise at the victory, but also sadness at the loss of life and anger at the rebellion. There might also be some fear and disgust associated with the rebellion. Initial scores: joy=7, sadness=5, anger=6, fear=3, disgust=4, surprise=6. Upon further reflection, the primary emotion I want to convey is joy at the Union victory and the suppression of the rebellion, so I will increase the joy score. I will also increase the anger score, as the rebellion was a direct attack on the United States. I will decrease the sadness score, as the focus is on victory, not loss. I will keep the fear and disgust scores the same, as they are secondary emotions. I will also keep the surprise score the same, as the presentation of the flags is meant to be a symbolic gesture, not a shocking event. Revised scores: joy=8, sadness=4, anger=7, fear=3, disgust=4, surprise=6.",
