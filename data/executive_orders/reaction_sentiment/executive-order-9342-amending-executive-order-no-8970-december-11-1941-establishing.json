    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding the Narragansett Bay Defensive Sea Area. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect its territory. However, the document itself is very technical and specific, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in most people. The tone is formal and legalistic, which further reduces the emotional impact. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1",
