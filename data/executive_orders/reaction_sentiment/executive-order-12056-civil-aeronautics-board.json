As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in my leadership. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey a sense of order and control. There is a hint of joy that the person is able to continue working. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear or disgust. There is a small amount of surprise that the person is being exempted again.",
