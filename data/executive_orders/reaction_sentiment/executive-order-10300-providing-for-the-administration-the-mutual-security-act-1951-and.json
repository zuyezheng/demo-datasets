    "critique": "The initial scores are based on a first pass through the document. The document is primarily administrative, delegating authority and coordinating efforts related to mutual security. There's a sense of wanting to project confidence and control, but not necessarily to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. However, after further consideration, I think the 'surprise' score should be slightly higher, as the sweeping changes and terminations might catch some off guard. Also, there's a subtle undercurrent of 'fear' related to national security, which warrants a slightly higher score.",
