    "critique": "The document aims to instill a sense of hope and opportunity in young people through student aid and employment. It also seeks to project an image of decisive action and effective governance. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through providing opportunities), and a reduction in fear and sadness (related to economic hardship). There might be a touch of surprise at the scale and scope of the program. Disgust and anger are less relevant here, though some might be angered by the limitations of the aid.",
