The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for nature conservation) and perhaps a bit of surprise or interest. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The intensity is relatively low across the board, as it's a practical, administrative action.",
