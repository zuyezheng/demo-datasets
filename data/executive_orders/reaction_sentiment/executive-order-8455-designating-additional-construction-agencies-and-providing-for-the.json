    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on construction planning and coordination. As the President, I aim to convey a sense of order, control, and progress. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of confidence and stability. There is little room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise in such a formal document. The language is technical and bureaucratic, further suppressing emotional expression. Therefore, most scores should be low, reflecting the document's neutral tone. I will revise the initial scores to better reflect this.",
