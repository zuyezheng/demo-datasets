    "critique": "The document aims to establish a migratory bird refuge. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for nature lovers and conservationists) and perhaps a sense of surprise at the scale of the project. There might be a little sadness for those who might have used the land differently, but overall, the tone is positive and forward-looking. There is no anger, fear, or disgust associated with the document. The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 2, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 4. Upon further reflection, the element of surprise might be overstated. The document is more about steady progress than sudden change. The revised scores are joy: 7, sadness: 2, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 3.",
