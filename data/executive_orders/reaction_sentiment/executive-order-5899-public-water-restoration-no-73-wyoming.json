    "critique": "The document is a revocation of an executive order related to Public Water Reserve No. 2, Wyoming No. 1. It restores land to the public domain. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps relief that land is being returned to the public domain for disposition under applicable laws. There isn't a strong emotional tone, but rather a procedural one. Therefore, most emotions will be low. Joy might be present in a small amount due to the land being returned to the public domain. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely.",
