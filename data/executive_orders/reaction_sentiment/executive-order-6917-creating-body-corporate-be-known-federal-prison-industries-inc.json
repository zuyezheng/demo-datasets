    "critique": "The document aims to establish Federal Prison Industries, Inc. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of order, control, and perhaps a degree of hope that this new corporation will improve the prison system and reduce unfair competition with private industries. There's no explicit mention of emotions, so I'll infer based on the actions and language used. Joy is unlikely to be a primary emotion, but a sense of satisfaction might be present. Sadness is not intended. Anger is not the goal, but some private industries might feel it. Fear is not the intention. Disgust is not the intention. Surprise is not the intention, as the order is a formal action. The initial scores are based on these assumptions. Upon review, I think the initial scores are reasonable, but I will adjust them slightly to better reflect the subtle nuances of the document's intent. I will increase the joy score slightly to reflect the potential for positive outcomes and decrease the surprise score as the order is a formal action.",
