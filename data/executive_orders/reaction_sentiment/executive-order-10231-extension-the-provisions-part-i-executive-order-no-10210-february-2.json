    "critique": "The document is an executive order extending certain powers to the Tennessee Valley Authority. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and security that the national defense is being facilitated. The tone is formal and authoritative. There isn't a strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely as this seems like a procedural extension of existing powers. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low initially.",
