    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and trust in the government's ability to manage public lands responsibly. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy is unlikely, as this is a formal announcement. Sadness is not intended. Anger is not the goal, but some may be unhappy with land restrictions. Fear is not a primary emotion here. Disgust is unlikely. Surprise might be present for those unaware of the act.",
