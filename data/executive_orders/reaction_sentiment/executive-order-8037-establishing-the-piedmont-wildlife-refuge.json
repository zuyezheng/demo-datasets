    "critique": "The document establishes a wildlife refuge. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (protecting wildlife), and perhaps a little surprise and reduced fear as the wildlife is protected. There might be a touch of sadness for those who can no longer hunt in the area, and disgust at those who would harm wildlife. The tone is authoritative and decisive, aiming to inspire confidence and respect for the environment.",
