    "critique": "The document focuses on amending an existing executive order related to service certificates and badges for military personnel assigned to the White House. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of respect and appreciation for the military personnel serving in the White House. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order is simply an amendment.Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
