The primary goal is to enact a specific decision, not to elicit strong emotions. The most relevant emotions might be a mild sense of satisfaction (joy) for those who support the decision and perhaps a touch of surprise for those unaware of the situation. Other emotions are unlikely to be significantly present.",
