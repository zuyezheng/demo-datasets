    "critique": "The document focuses on promoting women's participation in conflict resolution and protecting populations from atrocities. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (related to peace and security), and a reduction in fear, disgust, and sadness related to violence and conflict. There's also an element of surprise in addressing these issues proactively. The initial scores reflect these intentions, but the revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the emphasis on positive outcomes and proactive measures.",
