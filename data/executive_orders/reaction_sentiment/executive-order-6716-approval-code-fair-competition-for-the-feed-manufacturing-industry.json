The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the economy and fairness in the industry. There is a slight sense of joy that the policy of Congress is being effectuated. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight sense of surprise that the American Feed Manufacturers' Association, Inc. needs to amend its by-laws.",
