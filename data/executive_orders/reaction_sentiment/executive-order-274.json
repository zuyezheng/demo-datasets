The language used is formal and emphasizes the importance of the occasion. The actions ordered, such as displaying the flag at half-mast and draping buildings in mourning, are intended to convey grief and respect. The military honors are a sign of respect. The initial scores reflect these emotions, with sadness being the highest. The revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the intensity of the emotions conveyed.",
