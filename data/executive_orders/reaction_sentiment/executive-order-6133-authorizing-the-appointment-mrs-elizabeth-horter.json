    "critique": "The document is a short statement about an appointment. The tone is formal and direct. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a mild sense of satisfaction or perhaps a lack of concern. There's no strong indication of any particular emotion. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board initially. Then, upon reflection, I will adjust the scores to reflect a slightly more positive outlook, assuming the President believes this appointment is a good thing.",
