As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief or perhaps mild joy that a bureaucratic hurdle has been removed. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise might be a very mild reaction for those directly affected.",
