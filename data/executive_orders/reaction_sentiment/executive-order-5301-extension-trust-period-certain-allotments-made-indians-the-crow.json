    "critique": "The document is an executive order extending a trust period for land allotments to Native Americans. As the author, the President likely wants to convey a sense of reassurance and stability. The primary emotion is likely a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the policy is being continued, and perhaps a reduction in fear or anxiety among the Native Americans affected. There's not much sadness, anger, disgust, or surprise evident or intended. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions.",
