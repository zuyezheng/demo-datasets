    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The primary goal is to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. The tone is neutral and legalistic, aiming to convey a sense of authority and impartiality. There's little explicit emotional content. However, implicit emotions can be inferred. The President likely wants to inspire a sense of calm and confidence that the situation is being handled. Fear and anger should be minimized. Surprise is unlikely. Joy is not relevant. Sadness is also not relevant, but a low score is appropriate. Disgust is not relevant.",
