    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of an individual from compulsory retirement. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order, demonstrating the proper functioning of government. There's little to suggest strong emotions. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise might be a very mild element, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
