    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order, allowing the President to appoint additional members to a board and its executive committee. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of order and control, but this is very subtle. The changes are minor and procedural, so strong emotions are unlikely. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.
