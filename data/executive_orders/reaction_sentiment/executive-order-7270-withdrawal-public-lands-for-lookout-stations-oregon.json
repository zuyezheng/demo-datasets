    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land use. As the author, the President, I am primarily concerned with the efficient and legal execution of policy. The primary emotions I want to elicit are trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources effectively. However, the document itself is quite dry and procedural, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. I will revise the scores to reflect the intent to inspire trust and confidence, but acknowledging the document's limited emotional impact.",
