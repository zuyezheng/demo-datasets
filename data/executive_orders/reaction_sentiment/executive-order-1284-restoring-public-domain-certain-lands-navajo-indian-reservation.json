    "critique": "The document discusses restoring land to the public domain. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction that land disputes are being resolved. There isn't a lot of emotional language here, so most scores will be low. Joy might be a 2, sadness a 1, anger a 1, fear a 1, disgust a 1, and surprise a 1. After further consideration, the document is very neutral and unlikely to elicit strong emotions. Therefore, I will revise the scores to be even lower.",
