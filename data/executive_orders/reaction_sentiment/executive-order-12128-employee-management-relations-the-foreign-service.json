    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding labor relations of Foreign Service employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and order. The language is formal and bureaucratic, suggesting a desire for a calm and organized response. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The changes are relatively minor and procedural. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. After further consideration, the document aims to convey a sense of order and control, which might elicit a slight sense of reassurance or reduced fear. Therefore, I will adjust the fear score slightly downward.",
