    "critique": "The document is an executive order outlining emergency preparedness measures. As the President, I aim to evoke a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to handle a national emergency. The primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of calm preparedness, not fear or panic. However, the context of a potential attack necessitates some level of concern. The order also aims to inspire confidence in the government's ability to coordinate resources and protect its citizens. I will score each emotion based on this understanding.",
