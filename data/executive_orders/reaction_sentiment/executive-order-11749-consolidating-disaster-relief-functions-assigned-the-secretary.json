    "critique": "The document focuses on delegating authority and establishing a council for disaster assistance. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to handle disasters. There's also an element of hope that the policies will improve disaster response. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression.",
