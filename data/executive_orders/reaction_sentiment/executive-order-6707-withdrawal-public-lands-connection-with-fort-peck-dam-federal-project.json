    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing public lands from settlement, location, sale, or entry for the Fort Peck Dam and Reservoir project. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy, as the project aims to improve public works and provide resources. There might be some sadness from those displaced or unable to settle on the withdrawn lands, and potentially some surprise at the scale of the withdrawal. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, or disgust.",
