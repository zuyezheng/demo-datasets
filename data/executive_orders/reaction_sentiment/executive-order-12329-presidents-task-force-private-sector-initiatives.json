    "critique": "The document aims to establish a task force to promote private sector initiatives and reduce dependence on government. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (or optimism) that public needs will be met through private sector leadership. There might be a hint of surprise that the private sector can be so effective. There's likely a desire to reduce sadness or concern about public problems by addressing them through this task force. There's little to suggest fear, disgust, or anger. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
