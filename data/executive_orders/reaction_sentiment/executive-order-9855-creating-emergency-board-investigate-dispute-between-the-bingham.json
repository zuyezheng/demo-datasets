    "critique": "The document describes a labor dispute and the creation of a board to investigate it. The primary goal is to prevent interruption of interstate commerce. The tone is formal and legalistic. The president likely wants to convey a sense of calm and control, minimizing fear and anger. There's a slight element of hope that the board will resolve the issue, leading to a small amount of joy. Sadness and disgust are not relevant here. Surprise is also not a major factor, as the process is established by law. Revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding of the emotional landscape.",
