    "critique": "The document is a set of amendments to customs rules. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to a sense of order, efficiency, and perhaps a slight sense of surprise that these changes are being made. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The critique suggests that the surprise score could be slightly higher to reflect the fact that changes are being made at all.",
