    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding appointments within the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library. The tone is official and procedural. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and efficiency in the administration of government resources, but this is very subtle. There's no strong indication of any particular emotion. Therefore, most scores should be low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be intended emotions. A slight sense of confidence or perhaps mild approval might be aimed for.",
