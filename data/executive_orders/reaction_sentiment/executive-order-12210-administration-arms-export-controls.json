    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding arms export control. It primarily delegates authority to the Secretary of Defense. The tone is formal and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are confidence in the government's ability to manage arms exports effectively and a sense of order and control. There is little to suggest strong emotions. Joy would be low as this is a formal document. Sadness would be low as there is no loss. Anger would be low as there is no conflict. Fear would be low as there is no threat. Disgust would be low as there is nothing repulsive. Surprise would be low as it is an expected amendment.",
