    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on delegating authority and revoking a previous order. The tone is formal and legalistic, with little emphasis on emotional expression. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise should be low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
