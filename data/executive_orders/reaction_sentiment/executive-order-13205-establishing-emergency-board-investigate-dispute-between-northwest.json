    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of control and resolution rather than strong emotions. The primary goal is to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. Therefore, the emotions elicited are relatively mild. Joy is unlikely, sadness is irrelevant, anger is suppressed, fear is addressed by preventing disruption, disgust is not applicable, and surprise is unwanted. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
