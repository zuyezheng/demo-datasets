    "critique": "The document describes the appointment of Mrs. Pearl McIntosh to a position in the General Accounting Office. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, as the order is intended to help a widow and her children. There might also be some sadness associated with the loss of her husband, Fred D. McIntosh. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 4, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, and surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is primarily about providing support to a widow and her children, so the joy score should be higher, and the sadness score should be lower. The revised scores are joy: 8, sadness: 3, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, and surprise: 1.",
