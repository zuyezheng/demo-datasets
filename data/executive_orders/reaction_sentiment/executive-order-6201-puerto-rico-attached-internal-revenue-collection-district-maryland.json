    "critique": "The document is a simple order to attach Puerto Rico to the Internal Revenue Collection District of Maryland. The tone is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional appeals. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in governance. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The action is a routine administrative matter.",
