    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding holiday observances for government employees. The tone is neutral and procedural. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and clarity. There's no indication of strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems like a routine administrative matter. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
