    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the Interparliamentary Union as a public international organization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and adherence to international agreements. There is little to suggest strong emotions. The designation itself might bring a mild sense of joy to those who support the organization, and perhaps mild surprise to those unaware of it. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
