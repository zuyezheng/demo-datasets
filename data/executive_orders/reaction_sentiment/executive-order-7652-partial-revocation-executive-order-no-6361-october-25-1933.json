    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land in California. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction for those who benefit from the land being released, or mild disappointment for those who preferred the land remain withdrawn. The tone is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board.",
