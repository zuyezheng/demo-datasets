However, the surprise score might be slightly elevated, as the order primarily formalizes existing practices and delegates authority rather than introducing radical changes. The revised scores reflect a more nuanced assessment, with a slight decrease in surprise and a corresponding increase in joy, reflecting the positive outcomes expected from the order's implementation.",
