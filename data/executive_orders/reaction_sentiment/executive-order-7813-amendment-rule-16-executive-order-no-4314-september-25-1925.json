    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a rule regarding tolls for vessels in ballast in the Panama Canal. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in the operation of the Panama Canal. There's no indication of strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is purely administrative.",
