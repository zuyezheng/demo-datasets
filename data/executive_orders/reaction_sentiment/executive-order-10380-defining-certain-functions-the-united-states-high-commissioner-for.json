    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the United States High Commissioner for Germany. The tone is authoritative and procedural. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's operations, but the document itself doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on delegation of authority and lines of supervision. There are no strong clues to suggest any specific emotional response beyond perhaps a mild sense of reassurance that the government is functioning. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will revise the initial scores to better reflect the lack of emotional content.",
