    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax returns and congressional oversight. The tone is neutral and legalistic. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to trust in government and adherence to the law, but not strongly expressed. There is a slight element of surprise that the order is being made, but it is not a major factor. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for all emotions. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the document's nature.",
