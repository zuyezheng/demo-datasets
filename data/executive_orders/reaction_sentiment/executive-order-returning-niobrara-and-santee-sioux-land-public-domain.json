    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation within the Niobrara or Santee Sioux Indian Reservation. As the President, the primary goal isn't to elicit strong emotions but to execute policy. However, some emotions might be present. Joy might be present for settlers gaining access to land, but it's not a primary focus. Sadness might be felt by the Native Americans losing land. Fear and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely. The tone is formal and authoritative, not designed to evoke strong emotions.",
