    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the termination of the Office of Defense Transportation and the transfer of its responsibilities to the Interstate Commerce Commission. The tone is administrative and legalistic. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are likely related to reassurance, stability, and confidence in the smooth transition of responsibilities. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The focus is on efficiency and order. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The rationale for increasing Joy to 2 is that the President might hope for a mild sense of satisfaction or relief that a government office is being efficiently terminated and its functions transferred.",
