    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of John G. Honey from compulsory retirement. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and confidence in their decision-making. There isn't strong emotional language, but the act of exempting someone suggests a desire to inspire a little joy in the person being exempted and perhaps a sense of surprise that they are being given an extension. The other emotions are not strongly represented. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
