    "critique": "The document is a legal order modifying the boundaries of military reservations. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in managing military resources. There is no strong emotional appeal, but a sense of confidence and control might be subtly conveyed. Therefore, I will score low on all emotions except perhaps a slight sense of confidence which could translate to a low level of joy or surprise that the matter is being handled.",
