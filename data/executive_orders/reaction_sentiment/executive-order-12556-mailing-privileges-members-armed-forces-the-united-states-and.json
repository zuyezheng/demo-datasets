    "critique": "The document is a formal delegation of authority regarding free mailing privileges. The tone is official and procedural. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are minimal. There's no intention to evoke strong feelings. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended. Surprise might be a very mild element if the delegation is unexpected, but overall, the emotional impact is low. Revised scores reflect this neutrality.",
