    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing a commission for space exploration. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are surprise and joy, related to the new vision for space exploration. There might be a little fear and sadness because of resource constraints. Disgust and anger are unlikely to be elicited. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I will adjust them slightly to reflect the emphasis on joy and surprise.",
