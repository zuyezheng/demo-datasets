    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections by a Senate committee. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's operations, and perhaps a sense of surprise that the government is being so transparent. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable given the document's nature. No significant revisions are needed.",
