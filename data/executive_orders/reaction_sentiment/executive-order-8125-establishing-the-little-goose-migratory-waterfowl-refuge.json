The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (at the preservation of wildlife), and perhaps a bit of surprise and awe at the natural world. There might be a touch of sadness considered for the animals that are endangered. There is no anger, fear, or disgust intended to be conveyed. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
