    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on delegating authority and assigning functions related to trade and international development. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and compliance. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through poverty reduction and hunger elimination) and perhaps surprise (at the efficiency of the delegation). There's little to suggest significant sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
