    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the transfer of employees to the United States Housing Authority. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for those benefiting from the order) and perhaps surprise (at the efficiency of the government). There might be a little fear from those not transferred, but overall, the document seems designed to inspire confidence and satisfaction. The initial scores are based on this assessment. The critique is that the document is very specific and technical, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. The revised scores reflect this.",
