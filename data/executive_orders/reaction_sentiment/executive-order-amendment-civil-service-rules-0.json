    "critique": "The document is a short amendment to a departmental rule, adding a position to the list of exceptions from examination. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably related to trust and efficiency in the government's operations, but the document is too specific and procedural to convey strong emotions. The tone is neutral and formal. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After revision, I will keep the scores low as the document does not elicit strong emotions.",
