    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on designating the African Development Bank as a public international organization. The primary goal is to facilitate US participation and clarify legal and administrative aspects. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and compliance rather than eliciting strong emotions. The document does not contain strong emotional language. Therefore, the initial scores are low across all emotions.",
