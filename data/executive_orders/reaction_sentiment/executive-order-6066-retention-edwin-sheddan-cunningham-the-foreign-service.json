    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the retention of a Foreign Service Officer. The tone is official and bureaucratic. There's no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is to execute a specific action under legal authority, not to evoke emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, the language is neutral and factual, so the initial assessment holds. There's no basis for adjusting the scores.",
