    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of decisive action and reassurance during wartime. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and security that the war effort will not be hampered by labor disputes. There's also an element of fear being addressed, the fear of the war effort being impeded. There is a minor amount of sadness that the President is trying to convey, as the President is taking over a private company. There is no anger, disgust, or surprise being conveyed.",
