    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the operation of railroads in Alaska. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's ability to manage infrastructure. The tone is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to convey competence and control. There isn't much emotional content, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, as it's a formal order. Sadness is not relevant. Anger is not intended. Fear is not intended. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise might be a little higher, as the order clarifies operational responsibilities. The initial scores are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Upon review, I think surprise is too high. It's more about competence and stability, so I will adjust the scores to: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
