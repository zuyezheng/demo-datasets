    "critique": "The document is a straightforward executive order about land withdrawal for road construction. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is working to improve infrastructure. There's not a strong emotional component to this document, but I'll try to score the emotions based on the likely impact. Joy might be a slight positive from improved roads, sadness is minimal, anger is unlikely, fear is negligible, disgust is unlikely, and surprise is low as it's a routine action.",
