Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Critique: The initial scores seem appropriate given the nature of the document. There's a slight possibility of surprise due to the change, but it's likely minimal. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
