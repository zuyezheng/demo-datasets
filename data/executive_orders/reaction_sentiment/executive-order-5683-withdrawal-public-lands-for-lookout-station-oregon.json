    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for a lookout station. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect resources. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of calm and trust is desired. The language is formal and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. After further consideration, I think a slight sense of confidence (joy) and reduced fear of fire damage are intended, so I will adjust those scores slightly upward.",
