    "critique": "The document primarily aims to reassure and instill confidence. The President wants to convey a sense of decisive action and control during a time of emergency. The use of legal justifications and the allocation of funds are intended to project an image of stability and progress. The emotions I want to convey are joy that the civil works program will continue, and surprise that the disbursing officers are withholding payments. There is a hint of disgust that the disbursing officers are not following directions. There is no indication of fear, anger, or sadness.",
