    "critique": "The document aims to inspire confidence and stability through the National Industrial Recovery Act. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (economic recovery and industrial peace), and perhaps a reduction in fear and sadness related to the economic hardship of the time. There's an element of surprise in the proactive measures being taken. Disgust and anger are less relevant in the intended emotional response, but there might be a slight reduction in anger due to the resolution of industrial disputes. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I'll refine them based on the detailed analysis.",
