    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a Trade Policy Committee. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to manage trade policy effectively. There's a sense of order and control being established. Joy is unlikely to be a primary emotion, nor is sadness. Anger and fear are also unlikely, unless from those who oppose the policy. Surprise is possible, but not strongly conveyed. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
