The language is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional appeal. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources responsibly. There might be a secondary emotion of joy for those who value conservation and wildlife preservation.",
