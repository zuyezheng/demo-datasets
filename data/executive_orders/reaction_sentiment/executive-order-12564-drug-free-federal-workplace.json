    "critique": "The document aims to address drug use among federal employees. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of reassurance (joy) that the government is taking action to ensure a safe and productive workplace, a sense of fear among drug users that their behavior will not be tolerated, and a sense of disgust towards drug use itself. There might also be a degree of sadness associated with the recognition of the problem and the need for rehabilitation. Surprise is less relevant here, as the order is more about addressing an existing issue than introducing something completely unexpected. The initial scores reflect these considerations, with joy, fear, and disgust being relatively high, sadness moderate, and surprise low. However, after further consideration, the initial scores need some adjustment. The emphasis on rehabilitation and helping employees suggests a slightly higher level of joy or hope. The potential consequences for drug users might induce more fear than initially estimated. The revised scores reflect these adjustments.",
