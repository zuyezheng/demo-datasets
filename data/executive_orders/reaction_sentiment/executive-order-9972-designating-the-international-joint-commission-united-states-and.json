    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the International Joint Commission as a public international organization. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and continued cooperation. There is no strong indication of intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a focus on procedure and established relationships. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for joy reflecting the positive outcome of continued cooperation.",
