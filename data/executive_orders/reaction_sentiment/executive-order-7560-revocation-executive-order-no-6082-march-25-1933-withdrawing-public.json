    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in Wyoming. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps relief that an outdated order is being corrected. However, the document is very dry and procedural, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, most emotions will be scored low. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Joy might be present in a very mild form if the revocation is seen as a positive step. Sadness is unlikely. Surprise is also unlikely, as these orders are usually anticipated by the relevant parties.",
