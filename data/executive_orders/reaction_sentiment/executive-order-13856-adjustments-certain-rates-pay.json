    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding pay scales for various government employees. The tone is neutral and factual, aiming to implement adjustments to pay in accordance with existing laws. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and order, not strong emotions. The document is unlikely to evoke strong feelings of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is very dry and factual, so most emotions should be very low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
