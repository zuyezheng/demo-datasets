    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on a minor administrative change (increasing the number of members on a council). The tone is neutral and bureaucratic. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to enact a policy change, not to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. However, a slight sense of 'surprise' might be present due to the unexpected nature of the change, but it would be minimal. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
