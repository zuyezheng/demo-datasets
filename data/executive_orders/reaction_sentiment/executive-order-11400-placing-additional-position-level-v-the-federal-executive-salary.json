    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order, adding the Department of Commerce to the list in section 2 of Executive Order No. 11248. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no explicit emotional appeal or expression. As such, the primary emotions elicited are likely to be minimal. The scores should reflect this lack of emotional content, with most scores being low.",
