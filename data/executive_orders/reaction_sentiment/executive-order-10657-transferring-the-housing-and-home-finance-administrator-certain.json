    "critique": "The document is a legal order transferring responsibilities from the Atomic Energy Commission to the Housing and Home Finance Administrator. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in the transfer of power. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy might be a little higher if the President believes this transfer will improve housing and home finance. Surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness should be very low as the document is purely administrative.",
