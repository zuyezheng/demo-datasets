It also seeks to instill a sense of hope and determination that the US is taking action to address the situation. The order aims to convey a sense of resolve and strength in the face of injustice, while also acknowledging the suffering of the Burmese people. The document does not explicitly aim to evoke joy, fear, disgust, or surprise, but these emotions may be present to some extent as secondary reactions to the primary emotions of sadness, anger, and hope.",
