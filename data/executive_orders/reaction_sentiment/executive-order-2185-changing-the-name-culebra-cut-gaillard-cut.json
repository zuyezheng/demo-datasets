The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (in the form of pride and satisfaction) for Gaillard's accomplishments and sadness for his passing. There might be a slight element of surprise for those unaware of Gaillard's contributions, but it's not a primary focus. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust.",
