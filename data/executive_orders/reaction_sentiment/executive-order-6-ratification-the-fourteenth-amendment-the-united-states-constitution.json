    "critique": "The document is a formal proclamation announcing the ratification of an amendment by Alabama. The tone is official and procedural. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of acceptance and compliance with the law. There's little room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely given the formal nature of the announcement. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the document's nature.",
