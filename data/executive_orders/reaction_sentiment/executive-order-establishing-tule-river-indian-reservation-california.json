    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a reservation for several Native American tribes. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for the tribes receiving the land), and perhaps a reduction in fear and anger among settlers who might have felt threatened by the Native American presence. However, the tone is very formal and bureaucratic, so strong emotions are unlikely. The order aims to resolve a previous issue, suggesting a desire to reduce sadness or frustration related to the previous canceled order. Surprise is unlikely as this seems to be a planned action.",
