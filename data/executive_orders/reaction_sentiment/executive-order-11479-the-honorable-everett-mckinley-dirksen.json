    "critique": "The document expresses respect and mourning for Everett McKinley Dirksen. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is sadness, with secondary emotions of respect and perhaps a touch of surprise at the sudden loss. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of sadness is moderate, given the formal tone and the specific action of lowering the flag to half-staff.",
