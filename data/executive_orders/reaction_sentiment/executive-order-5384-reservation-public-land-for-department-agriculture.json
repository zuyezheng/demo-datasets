    "critique": "The document describes the reservation of land in Alaska for the Alaska Game Commission. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and stability. There is a slight element of joy that the land is being used for a good purpose. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the land is being reserved.",
