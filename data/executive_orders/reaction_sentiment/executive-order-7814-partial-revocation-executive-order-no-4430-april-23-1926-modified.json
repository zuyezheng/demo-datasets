    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief or perhaps mild satisfaction that a bureaucratic process is being corrected or updated. There isn't strong language to suggest intense emotions. Joy would be low, as it's a technical correction. Sadness is not relevant. Anger is not relevant. Fear is not relevant. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise might be a little higher than the others, as the revocation might be unexpected, but still relatively low.",
