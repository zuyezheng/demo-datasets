The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and competence in governance, with perhaps a hint of gratitude from the individual being exempted. There's no strong indication of intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
