    "critique": "The document focuses on standardization and procedural guidelines for Executive Orders and Proclamations. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for clarity and consistency. There's no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is to establish a clear process, not to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. However, a slight sense of reassurance or relief might be present due to the establishment of order, leading to a slightly higher joy score than other negative emotions.",
