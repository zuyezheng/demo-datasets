The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, as the initiative aims to improve the lives of individuals with mental illness and children with emotional disturbances. There might be a sense of hope and relief (low fear/sadness) that the government is addressing these issues. There isn't much to suggest anger, disgust, or surprise.",
