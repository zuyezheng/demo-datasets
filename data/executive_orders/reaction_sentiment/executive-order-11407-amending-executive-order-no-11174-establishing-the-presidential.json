    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing and modifying awards for military personnel assigned to the White House. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of pride and recognition for those serving in the White House. There's little to suggest strong emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely given the nature of the document. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy (pride) being the highest and other emotions being low. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity of joy and reduce the others further, as the document is quite dry and procedural.",
