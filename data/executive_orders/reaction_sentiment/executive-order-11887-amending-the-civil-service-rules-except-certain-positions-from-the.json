The primary emotion the president wants to elicit is likely a mild sense of satisfaction or agreement with the efficient functioning of government. There's no strong language or tone to suggest intense emotions. The scores should be low across the board, with perhaps a slightly higher score for joy if the amendment is seen as a positive step.",
