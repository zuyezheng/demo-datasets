    "critique": "The document is focused on industrial mobilization for war. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and resolve. There's an element of fear addressed by ensuring resources are available, but the overall tone is about taking control and ensuring victory. There's little room for joy or sadness in such a document. Disgust might be present in the context of the enemy, but not explicitly stated. Surprise is not a major factor.",
