    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding exceptions to the Government Employees Training Act for the Central Intelligence Agency. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's ability to manage its agencies effectively and in the interest of national security. The tone is formal and legalistic, suggesting a focus on procedure and authority rather than emotional appeal. There is little to suggest strong emotions. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not explicitly conveyed. The document aims for a neutral, authoritative tone. Therefore, the initial scores are all low.",
