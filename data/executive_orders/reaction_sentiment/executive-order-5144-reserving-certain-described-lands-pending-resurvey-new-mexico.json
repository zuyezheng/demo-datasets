    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal in New Mexico. The tone is formal and objective. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to the law. There's no explicit emotional appeal, so the scores should be low across the board. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the act of preserving land might evoke a slight sense of joy or relief in some, but it's still minimal. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
