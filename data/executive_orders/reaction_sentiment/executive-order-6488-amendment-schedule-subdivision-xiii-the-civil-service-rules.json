    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to civil service rules, specifically adding positions to the Office of the Secretary. The tone is purely administrative and legalistic. There's no explicit attempt to evoke any particular emotion. The primary goal is to enact a change in personnel structure, not to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
