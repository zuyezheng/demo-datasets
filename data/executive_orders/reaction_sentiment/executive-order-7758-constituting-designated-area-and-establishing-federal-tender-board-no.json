    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of control, stability, and prevention of waste. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through the benefit to the public and the increase in ultimate recovery of petroleum), and a reduction in fear and disgust (related to the wasteful practices and contraband oil). There's also an element of surprise being addressed, as the order continues existing measures, but reinforces them in light of ongoing potential violations. The tone is authoritative and factual, aiming to reassure the public and stakeholders.",
