    "critique": "The document is an official statement regarding the death of Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is sadness and respect for the deceased. There might be a sense of surprise due to the 'untimely death,' but the overall tone is somber and respectful. There's no intention to evoke joy, anger, fear, or disgust. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 8, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 9, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. The sadness score is increased to reflect the somber tone and the surprise score is decreased as the focus is more on mourning than shock.",
