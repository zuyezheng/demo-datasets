    "critique": "The document is a legal authorization for a judge to perform duties in the absence of another. The tone is formal and official. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the judicial system. There is no explicit mention of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the implicit emotions are related to trust and assurance. The initial scores are based on this interpretation. The critique is that the initial scores might be too high for emotions that are only implicitly conveyed. The revised scores reflect a more conservative assessment.",
