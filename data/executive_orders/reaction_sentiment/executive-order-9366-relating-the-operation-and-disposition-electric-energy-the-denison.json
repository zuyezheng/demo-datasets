The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through the provision of power and resources), and a reduction of fear (by ensuring a dependable market and unified control). There's also an element of surprise at the scale and efficiency of the project. There is little to no sadness, anger, or disgust intended to be conveyed by the document. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
