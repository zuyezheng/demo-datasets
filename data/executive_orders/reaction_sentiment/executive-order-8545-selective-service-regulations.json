    "critique": "The document is a set of regulations for the Selective Service Act of 1940. As the President, I want to convey a sense of order, justice, and efficiency in the implementation of this act. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of confidence in the system and a feeling of duty among the citizens. There is a hint of fear for those who do not comply with the law. The document is very formal and procedural, so strong emotions are not really intended. The initial scores reflect this.",
