    "critique": "The document aims to convey authority and control, primarily through the cancellation of the election and the extension of terms. The tone is formal and decisive. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order, but also perhaps a bit of surprise at the directness of the action. There's likely some fear among those whose positions are now dependent on the President's pleasure. There's little to suggest joy, sadness, or disgust.",
