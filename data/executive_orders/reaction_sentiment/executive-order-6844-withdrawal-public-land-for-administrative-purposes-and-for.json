    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the temporary withdrawal of public lands in California for use as a fire-lookout site and for classification in aid of legislation. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is taking action to protect natural resources and manage public lands responsibly. There is a hint of joy that the land will be used to protect the forests. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a little surprise that the order is being issued.",
