    "critique": "The document is an executive order to close governmental agencies on December 28, 1972, as a mark of respect for Harry S Truman. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is sadness for the loss of a former president and respect for his service. There might also be a sense of surprise at the sudden announcement of a holiday. The order also includes exceptions for national security or defense reasons, which could elicit a sense of fear if not handled properly. The tone is formal and respectful, which suggests a desire to convey sadness and respect rather than joy, anger, or disgust. The initial scores are based on this analysis.",
