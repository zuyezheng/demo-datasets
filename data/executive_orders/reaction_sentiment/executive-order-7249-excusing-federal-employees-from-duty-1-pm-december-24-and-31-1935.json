    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding government employees being excused from duty early on the days preceding Christmas and New Year's Day. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, as it allows employees to start their holidays early. There might be a little surprise, but mostly joy and perhaps a bit of reduced sadness as people can enjoy the holidays more. There's no real anger, fear, or disgust associated with this order. The language is formal and administrative, but the context is festive, suggesting a positive emotional response.",
