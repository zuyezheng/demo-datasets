There's an element of sadness related to the events that led to the order, but also a sense of hope and perhaps surprise at the possibility of moving forward. There might be some fear and disgust related to the past events, but the overall tone is one of moving towards a more stable future. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores adjust the intensity of some emotions based on a more careful reading.",
