It seeks to instill fear in those who facilitate these abuses, while also expressing a degree of sadness and concern for the victims. There's an element of surprise intended for those who might be caught off guard by the sanctions. Joy is not a primary emotion intended, nor is disgust, though the actions described are indeed disgusting. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
