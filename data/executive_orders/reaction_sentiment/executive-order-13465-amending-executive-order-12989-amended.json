    "critique": "The document focuses on promoting economy and efficiency in Federal Government procurement by ensuring compliance with immigration laws. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (from increased efficiency and stability) and perhaps a reduction in fear (related to potential disruptions from illegal workers). There might be some sadness from those negatively affected by the policy, but the overall tone is intended to be positive and reassuring. Surprise and disgust are less relevant in this context.",
