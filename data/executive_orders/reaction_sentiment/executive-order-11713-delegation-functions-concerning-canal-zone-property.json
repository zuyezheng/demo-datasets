    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding property transfers in the Canal Zone. The tone is legalistic and procedural. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to stability, order, and confidence in the functioning of government. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a factor if the changes are unexpected, but the language doesn't suggest that.
