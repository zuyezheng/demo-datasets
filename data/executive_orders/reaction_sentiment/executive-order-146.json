    "critique": "The document describes withdrawing land from sale and settlement. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and perhaps a little surprise that I am taking action to protect the land. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, with surprise being slightly higher than the others. Upon review, I think the surprise should be a bit higher, and the other emotions should remain low.",
