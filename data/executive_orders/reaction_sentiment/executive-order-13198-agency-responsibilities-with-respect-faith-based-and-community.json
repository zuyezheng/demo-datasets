It also seeks to address existing barriers, which might evoke some sadness or frustration that these barriers existed in the first place. The tone is generally positive and forward-looking, suggesting a desire to inspire confidence and optimism. There isn't a strong sense of fear, disgust, or anger being conveyed, but there might be a mild surprise at the extent of the barriers that need to be addressed.
