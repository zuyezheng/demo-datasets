    "critique": "The document outlines the appointment of members to the International Military Tribunal. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are those of justice, hope, and perhaps a sense of closure following the war. The tone is formal and authoritative, reflecting the gravity of the situation and the importance of holding war criminals accountable. There's an element of hope that justice will be served and that this tribunal will contribute to preventing future atrocities. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust conveyed directly in the text, but these emotions are underlying due to the context of the war crimes being addressed. Surprise is not really relevant here.",
