    "critique": "The document aims to counter terrorism and violent extremism. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security (reducing fear), hope (increasing joy), and perhaps a sense of justice (reducing anger/disgust towards the US). However, the document's tone is formal and bureaucratic, so the emotional impact is likely muted. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for most emotions. The revised scores attempt to better capture the intended, albeit subtle, emotional goals.",
