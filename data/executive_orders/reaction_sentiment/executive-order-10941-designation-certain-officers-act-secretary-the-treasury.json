    "critique": "The document is a standard executive order regarding the line of succession in the Treasury Department. The tone is formal and procedural. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as this is a routine administrative matter. The initial scores should reflect this.",
