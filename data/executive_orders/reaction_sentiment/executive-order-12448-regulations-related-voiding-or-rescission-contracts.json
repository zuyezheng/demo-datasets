    "critique": "The document aims to instill confidence and assurance in the government's ability to combat corruption and ensure fairness. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (in the sense of satisfaction that justice is being served) and a reduction in fear (that corruption will go unchecked). There might be some surprise at the extent of the authority being exercised, but overall, the tone is measured and authoritative. Disgust and sadness are present as emotions related to the acts of bribery, graft, and conflict of interest that the order addresses, but the order itself is not intended to elicit those emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.\n\nRevised scores:\n- Joy: Increased slightly to reflect the positive outcome of combating corruption.\n- Fear: Decreased slightly to reflect the reduction in fear of unchecked corruption.\n- Surprise: Remains the same as the order is not particularly surprising.\n- Sadness: Remains the same as the order is not intended to elicit sadness.\n- Disgust: Remains the same as the order is not intended to elicit disgust.\n- Anger: Remains the same as the order is not intended to elicit anger.",
