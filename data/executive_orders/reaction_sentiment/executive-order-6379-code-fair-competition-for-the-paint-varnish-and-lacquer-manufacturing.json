    "critique": "The document expresses formal approval of a code of fair competition. The tone is official and procedural, aiming to convey a sense of order and compliance with legal requirements. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's actions. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is more about process and legality than emotional impact. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise that the process is being completed.",
