    "critique": "The document is an amendment to exclude certain positions from the Civil Service Rules. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency, not strong emotions. The actions are very specific and unlikely to evoke strong feelings. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Critique: The initial scores are all 1 because the document is very dry and administrative. There's no indication of any strong emotion being conveyed or intended. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1",
