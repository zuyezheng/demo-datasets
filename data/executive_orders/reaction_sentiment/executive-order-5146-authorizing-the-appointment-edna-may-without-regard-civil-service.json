    "critique": "The document describes a situation where a widow is being appointed to a position to support her family after her husband's death. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the widow and her family will be taken care of. There might also be some sadness for the loss of her husband and the difficult situation she is in. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 5, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the joy score should be higher as the document focuses on providing support and a positive outcome for the widow and her family. The sadness score should be slightly lower as the focus is on the positive outcome rather than dwelling on the loss. The revised scores are joy: 8, sadness: 4, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
