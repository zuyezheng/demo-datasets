    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land exclusion from a national forest and reservation for townsite purposes. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of order and progress. There's no explicit emotional appeal, but the actions suggest a desire for development and settlement. Therefore, joy and surprise might be present, but at a low level. Sadness, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
