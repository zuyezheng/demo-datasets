    "critique": "The document outlines furloughing employees to avoid deficits. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is acceptance and understanding of the difficult situation. I want to minimize fear and sadness, while not necessarily aiming for joy. There might be some surprise at the measures, but I want to convey a sense of responsibility and necessity. The initial scores reflect this: low joy, moderate sadness and fear, minimal disgust, and some surprise. After reflection, I think the initial fear score is too high and should be lowered, and the surprise should also be lowered as the situation might have been anticipated.",
