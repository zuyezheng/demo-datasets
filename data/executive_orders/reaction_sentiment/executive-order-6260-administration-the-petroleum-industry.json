    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of authority, transferring powers related to the petroleum industry to the Secretary of the Interior. The tone is official and legalistic, with no explicit emotional appeals. The primary goal is efficient administration and compliance with existing legislation. Therefore, the intended emotions are minimal, with perhaps a slight sense of reassurance or confidence in the proper execution of the law. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. I increased joy to 2 because the president likely feels some satisfaction in delegating authority effectively.",
