    "critique": "The document describes the establishment of a reservation for several Native American tribes. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from the Native American tribes that now have land set aside for them. I also want to convey a sense of security and hope for the future. However, the tone is formal and bureaucratic, so the emotional impact might be limited. There might be some surprise from the tribes, but overall, the document is more about policy than emotion. The document does not seem to elicit sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
