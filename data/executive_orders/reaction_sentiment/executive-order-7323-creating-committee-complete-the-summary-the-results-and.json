    "critique": "The document aims to provide relief and recovery during the Depression. The tone is formal and authoritative, focusing on establishing a committee and division to analyze the effects of the National Recovery Administration. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely hope (through job creation and economic analysis), and perhaps a sense of security (by addressing the failures of past policies). There's little to suggest strong emotions like anger, disgust, or intense joy. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order seems to be a planned response to ongoing issues. Initial scores: Joy: 4, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 2. Upon further reflection, the document's focus on analysis and employment suggests a slightly stronger emphasis on hope and a reduction in fear. The other emotions remain relatively low. Revised scores: Joy: 5, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 2, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 2.",
