    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a reservation for the Piute and Snake Indians. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (for the Indians who now have a reservation), and perhaps a reduction in fear and anger among settlers due to clearly defined boundaries. There might be some sadness from those losing land, and potentially surprise at the action itself. Disgust is unlikely to be a primary emotion. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming for a sense of order and resolution.",
