    "critique": "The document discusses amending Civil Service Rules to allow laborers in the War Department to advance to classified positions through noncompetitive examination. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy, as this provides an opportunity for advancement for laborers. There might also be a sense of surprise that such a change is being implemented. There is little to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
