    "critique": "The document focuses on promoting energy production and reducing regulatory burdens. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (economic growth, job creation, energy independence) and perhaps a sense of security. There might be some fear among environmental groups, but the document attempts to mitigate this by mentioning clean air and water. There could be anger from those who oppose deregulation. Disgust is unlikely to be a primary emotion, and surprise is not really a focus. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The critique suggests increasing the joy score and slightly increasing the fear and anger scores to better reflect the potential reactions.",
