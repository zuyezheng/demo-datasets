    "critique": "The document describes the design of the Coat of Arms, Seal, Color and Flag of the President of the United States. The tone is formal and official. The language is descriptive and precise. The context is the establishment of official symbols. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy and pride in the nation and its symbols. There might be a touch of surprise at the detail and perhaps a little sadness that a previous order is being revoked. Disgust and fear are unlikely to be relevant here.Initial scores:joy: 7, sadness: 2, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 3Revised scores:joy: 8, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2",
