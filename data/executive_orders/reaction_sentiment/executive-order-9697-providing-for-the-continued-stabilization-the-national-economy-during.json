    "critique": "The President wants to convey a sense of stability and control during an emergency. The primary emotions to elicit are joy (economic stability), and perhaps a reduction in fear (of economic collapse). There might be some sadness due to the continuation of wartime measures, and potentially some anger from those who disagree with the policies. Disgust and surprise are less relevant. Initial scores: Joy: 7, Sadness: 3, Anger: 4, Fear: 5, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 3. Revised scores: Joy: 8, Sadness: 2, Anger: 3, Fear: 4, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. The emphasis is on stability and controlled economic adjustments.",
