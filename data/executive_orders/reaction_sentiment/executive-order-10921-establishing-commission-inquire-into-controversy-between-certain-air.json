    "critique": "The document establishes a commission to resolve disputes between flight engineers and pilots. The tone is formal and aims to convey a sense of order and resolution. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of calm, confidence, and perhaps a bit of surprise that action is being taken. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is neutral and focuses on the establishment and function of the commission. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for surprise due to the action being taken.",
