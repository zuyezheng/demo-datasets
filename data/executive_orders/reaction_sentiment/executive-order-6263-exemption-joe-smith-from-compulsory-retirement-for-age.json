    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Joe Smith from mandatory retirement. As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of decisive action and public service. The primary emotions I want to elicit are reassurance (that the government is functioning), and perhaps a mild sense of approval. There isn't strong emotional language, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy is unlikely, sadness is irrelevant, anger is not intended, fear is not a goal, disgust is not applicable, and surprise is not a factor. The tone is formal and bureaucratic.",
