    "critique": "The document revokes previous executive orders related to public water reserves. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in managing public lands. There's not a strong emotional component, but rather a bureaucratic adjustment. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. Joy might be present in a small amount due to the restoration, but sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be significant.",
