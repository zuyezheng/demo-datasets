    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Robert Dickens from mandatory retirement. As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of judiciousness and public service. The primary emotion I want to elicit is a mild sense of reassurance that decisions are being made in the public interest. There isn't a strong emphasis on any particular emotion, so the scores will be relatively low. Joy is unlikely, as it's a formal document. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are also unlikely to be primary emotions. Surprise might be present, but not strongly. The language is formal and legalistic, which tempers strong emotional responses.",
