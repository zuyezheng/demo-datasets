    "critique": "The document primarily deals with setting pay scales for various government employees. As such, it's unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy for those receiving a pay increase, or perhaps mild sadness/disgust for those who feel the increase is inadequate. There's little to suggest fear, anger, or surprise. The tone is very formal and administrative.",
