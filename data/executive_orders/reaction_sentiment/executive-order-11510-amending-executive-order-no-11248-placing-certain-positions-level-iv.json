    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, reassigning a position within the Department of Commerce. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no explicit or implicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is to execute a bureaucratic function, not to elicit any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
