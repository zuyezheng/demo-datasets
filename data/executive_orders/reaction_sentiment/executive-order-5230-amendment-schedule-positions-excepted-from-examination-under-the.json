    "critique": "The document is an amendment to Schedule A, creating an exception for private secretaries or confidential clerks to each member of the Federal Farm Board from civil service examination requirements. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of efficiency and perhaps mild satisfaction that the Farm Board can be properly staffed. There's no strong indication of intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality.",
