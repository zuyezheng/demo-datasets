    "critique": "The document is an executive order detailing changes to the field organization of the customs service in Texas. As the author, the President, the primary goal is efficiency and effective governance, not necessarily to elicit strong emotions. The order itself is administrative. Therefore, the intensity of emotions conveyed is likely to be low across the board. The order might bring a slight sense of joy to Laredo with the new headquarters, and perhaps some sadness to San Antonio for the loss of the headquarters. Fort Worth might experience a touch of sadness with the revocation of its designation. Other emotions are unlikely to be significantly affected.",
