    "critique": "The document describes the approval of an agreement between employers and employees in the construction industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the economy and the government's ability to manage it. There is a sense of joy that the agreement has been reached and approved, and a sense of reduced fear that the economy is improving. There is little to no sadness, anger, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document.",
