    "critique": "The document expresses a tone of resolve and determination to counter Iran's malign influence. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely fear (in Iran and those supporting it), and joy (in those who support the US and its policies). There's also an element of disgust towards Iran's actions. Surprise is less relevant, and sadness isn't a primary goal, though there might be some sadness over the situation in the Middle East.",
