    "critique": "The document primarily concerns the revocation of land withdrawals related to coal in New Mexico. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction that land is being made available. However, the document is very dry and technical. There is no strong emotional appeal. The strongest emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or perhaps surprise that such a specific action is being taken. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
