    "critique": "The document aims to establish control over public works concessions in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and control, potentially mixed with a degree of acceptance or resignation from the local authorities. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, or anger. Fear might be present due to the assertion of authority, and surprise could be minimal as these actions might be expected. Disgust is unlikely to be a primary emotion conveyed.",
