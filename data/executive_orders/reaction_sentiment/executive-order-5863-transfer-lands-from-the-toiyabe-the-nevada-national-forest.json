    "critique": "The document is a transfer of land between two national forests. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no explicit mention of emotions. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. The transfer itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The statement that it is not intended to change the status of any lands suggests an attempt to avoid causing fear or anger among those who might be affected. Surprise is unlikely, as such transfers are probably routine. Disgust and sadness are also unlikely to be relevant emotions in this context. Therefore, the initial scores are joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
