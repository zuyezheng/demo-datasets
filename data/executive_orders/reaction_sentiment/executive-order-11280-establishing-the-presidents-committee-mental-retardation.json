    "critique": "The document aims to address mental retardation through establishing a committee and coordinating efforts. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are hope and a sense of security that the issue is being taken seriously. There might be some sadness acknowledged due to the existence of the problem, but the overall tone is proactive and forward-looking. Surprise is not a major factor, as the document builds upon existing legislation. Disgust and fear are not directly elicited, but there might be an underlying sense of concern that needs to be addressed.",
