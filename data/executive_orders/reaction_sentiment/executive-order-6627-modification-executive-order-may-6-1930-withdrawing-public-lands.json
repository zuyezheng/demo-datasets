    "critique": "The document is a modification to an existing executive order to permit an airport lease. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of satisfaction or perhaps mild joy that the government is functioning properly and facilitating infrastructure development. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as this is a routine administrative action. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
