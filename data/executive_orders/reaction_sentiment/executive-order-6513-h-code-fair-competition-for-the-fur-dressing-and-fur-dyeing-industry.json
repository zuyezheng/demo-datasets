    "critique": "The document is an approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Fur Dressing and Fur Dyeing Industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the economy and fairness in the industry. There is a sense of joy that the code has been approved and that the industry will be regulated fairly. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the code has been approved so quickly.",
