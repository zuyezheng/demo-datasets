The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (through safety and well-being) and perhaps a reduction in sadness (due to fewer injuries). There might be a slight element of surprise due to the establishment of a new council and revocation of an old one. Fear, disgust, and anger are not explicitly targeted, so they should be low.",
