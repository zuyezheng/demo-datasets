    "critique": "The document aims to streamline the presidential appointment process. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and efficiency in the government. There might be a hint of surprise at the potential for simplification, but overall, the tone is formal and focused on process improvement. The language is neutral and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust should be low. Surprise might be slightly higher due to the focus on simplification.",
