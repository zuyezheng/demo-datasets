    "critique": "The document outlines military orders, aiming for efficiency and strategic advantage. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of confidence and resolve in the Union's ability to overcome the rebellion. There's an element of fear intended for the Confederacy, and perhaps a touch of surprise at the new command structure. Joy is not a primary emotion here, nor is sadness or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, with adjustments made to better capture the intent to instill confidence and project strength.",
