    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding amendments to the Code of Fair Competition for the Alcoholic Beverage Wholesale Industry. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of confidence, stability, and adherence to due process. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming to convey order and compliance with the law. There's little room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The focus is on the procedural correctness and the effectuation of congressional policy. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low intensities for all emotions.",
