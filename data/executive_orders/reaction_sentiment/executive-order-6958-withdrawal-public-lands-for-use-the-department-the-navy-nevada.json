    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal for the Department of the Navy. The tone is official and legalistic. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are likely related to trust, confidence, and perhaps a sense of security. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims for a neutral, authoritative effect. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on confidence-related emotions.",
