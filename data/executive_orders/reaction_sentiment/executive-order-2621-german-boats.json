As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect its assets. There might be a slight element of surprise that such measures are being taken, but overall, the tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust should be low, while surprise might be slightly higher.",
