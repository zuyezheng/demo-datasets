    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a migratory bird refuge. The primary goal is conservation, so the intended emotions are likely positive, such as joy at the preservation of nature and perhaps a sense of security or reduced fear regarding the loss of wildlife. However, the document is also legalistic and somewhat dry, so the intensity of these emotions might not be very high. There might be a slight element of disgust directed at those who would harm the environment, and perhaps a touch of surprise that such measures are being taken. Sadness and anger are less likely to be primary emotions elicited by this document.",
