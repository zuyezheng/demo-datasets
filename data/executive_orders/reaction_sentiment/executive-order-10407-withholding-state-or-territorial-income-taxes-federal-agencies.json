    "critique": "The document is a set of regulations regarding agreements between the Secretary of the Treasury and states/territories for withholding state income taxes from federal employees. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and compliance. There's a desire for states to feel like their tax collection processes are being respected and accommodated, but also a firm assertion of federal authority and limitations. Joy is low, as it's a regulatory document. Sadness is low, as there's no loss or lament. Anger is low, as the tone is neutral. Fear is low, as there's no threat implied. Disgust is low, as there's nothing repulsive. Surprise is low, as the content is expected.",
