    "critique": "The document is a legal order modifying the boundaries of a National Forest and reserving land for townsite purposes. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy and surprise that land is being made available for a townsite. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are joy: 5, surprise: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is primarily administrative. The emotions elicited are minimal. The revised scores are joy: 2, surprise: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1.",
