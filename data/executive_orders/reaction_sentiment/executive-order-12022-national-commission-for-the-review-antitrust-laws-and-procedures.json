    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on establishing a commission to review antitrust laws. The language is formal and procedural, suggesting a desire for order and efficiency rather than strong emotional reactions. However, a slight increase in 'joy' and 'surprise' might be warranted to reflect the potential for positive outcomes from the commission's work, such as improved legal processes and a fairer market.",
