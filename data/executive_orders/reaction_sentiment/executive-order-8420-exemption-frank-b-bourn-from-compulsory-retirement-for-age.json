    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of an individual from compulsory retirement. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order, and perhaps a slight sense of reassurance that the government is functioning properly. There is no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. After further consideration, the document is very neutral and factual. The revised scores should reflect this even more strongly.",
