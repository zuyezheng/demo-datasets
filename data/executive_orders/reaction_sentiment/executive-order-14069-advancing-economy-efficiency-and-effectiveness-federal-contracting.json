    "critique": "The document aims to address discriminatory pay practices and promote fairness. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from those who will benefit from the policy changes, and perhaps surprise that such changes are being implemented. There might be some sadness related to the acknowledgement of past discriminatory practices. There isn't a strong indication of fear, disgust, or anger being elicited by the document itself, but those emotions could be present in those who are against the policy changes. The initial scores reflect this assessment, but the revised scores adjust the intensity of joy and surprise slightly upwards to better reflect the positive intent of the document.",
