    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on security measures and amendments to existing regulations. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and order. There's a hint of fear reduction, as the measures aim to prevent damage or injury. There isn't much room for joy or surprise in such a document. Sadness and disgust are not relevant here. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores will emphasize the security aspect more strongly.",
