    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for potential addition to Zion National Park. The tone is formal and legalistic. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage public lands responsibly. There's no explicit emotional appeal, but the implicit message is one of conservation and preservation for public benefit. Therefore, joy might be a low score, sadness is not really applicable, anger is not the intention, fear is not applicable, disgust is not applicable, and surprise is not really applicable. The initial scores are based on this assessment. Upon review, I think the initial scores are reasonable, but I will adjust the joy score slightly upwards to reflect the positive aspect of land preservation.",
