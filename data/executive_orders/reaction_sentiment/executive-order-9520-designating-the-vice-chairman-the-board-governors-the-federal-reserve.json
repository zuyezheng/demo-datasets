    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of an appointment. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is confidence and stability in the financial system. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be low. The tone is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to inspire confidence rather than strong emotions. The actions are administrative, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal.",
