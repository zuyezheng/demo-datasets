    "critique": "The document aims to ensure adequate outdoor recreation resources for present and future generations. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy and a sense of security (avoiding fear and sadness about resource depletion). There might be some mild disgust at the thought of not properly managing these resources, and perhaps a little surprise at the extent of coordination required. The tone is formal and administrative, focusing on practicality and efficiency.",
