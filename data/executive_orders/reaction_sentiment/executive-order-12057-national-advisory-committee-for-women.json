    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, focused on expanding the membership of the National Advisory Committee for Women. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy, as it signifies progress and inclusivity. There might be a touch of surprise due to the amendment itself, but the other emotions are unlikely to be strongly conveyed. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy being the highest, followed by surprise, and the rest being minimal. Upon further reflection, the element of surprise might be overstated. The revision adjusts the surprise score downward, maintaining joy as the primary emotion.",
