    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The primary goal is to prevent disruption to interstate commerce. The tone is neutral and authoritative. The emotions the President likely wants to elicit are a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a factor. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, the initial scores accurately reflect the intended emotional impact of the document. No revisions are necessary.",
