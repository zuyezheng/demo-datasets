    "critique": "The document is a simple administrative order transferring responsibilities from the General Services Administration to the Department of Defense. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of confidence in the smooth functioning of government and national security. However, the order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board.",
