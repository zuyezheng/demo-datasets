    "critique": "The document aims to establish the American Heritage Rivers Initiative Advisory Committee. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy and surprise at the revitalization and preservation of American rivers. There's also an element of trust and confidence in the committee's ability to select deserving rivers. The document uses formal language, which tempers strong emotional expression. The actions are designed to foster community involvement and benefit from federal assistance, which should inspire joy and hope. The surprise element comes from the innovative programs and the diversity of rivers selected. There's a slight undercurrent of sadness related to degraded rivers, but the overall tone is positive and forward-looking. There is no anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document.",
