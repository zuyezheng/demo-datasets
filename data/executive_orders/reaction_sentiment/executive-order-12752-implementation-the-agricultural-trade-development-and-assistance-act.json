    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing and delegating authority for agricultural trade and assistance programs. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through providing aid and promoting progress) and perhaps a sense of reduced fear (by addressing food security). There's little to suggest strong negative emotions like sadness, anger, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely to be a major factor.",
