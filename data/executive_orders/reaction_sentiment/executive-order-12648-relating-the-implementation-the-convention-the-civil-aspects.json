    "critique": "The document primarily aims to establish a legal and administrative framework for handling international child abduction cases. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to handle such sensitive matters. There is a sense of responsibility and commitment to international agreements. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. Therefore, the scores should reflect a generally low emotional intensity, with a slight emphasis on reassurance (joy) and perhaps a touch of concern (sadness/fear) related to the gravity of child abduction cases. Surprise and disgust are unlikely to be relevant here.",
