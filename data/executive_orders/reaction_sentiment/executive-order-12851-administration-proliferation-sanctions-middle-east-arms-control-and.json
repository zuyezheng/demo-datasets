    "critique": "The document is a formal delegation of authority regarding weapons proliferation. As the President, I aim to convey a sense of control, responsibility, and seriousness. There's little room for joy or surprise. Sadness might be present due to the nature of the subject matter (weapons), but it's not a primary emotion I'm trying to evoke. Fear and disgust are relevant due to the dangers of proliferation, but the primary emotion I want to convey is a sense of firm control and responsible action. Therefore, I will adjust the scores to reflect this.",
