    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context. The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The primary goal is to prevent disruption to interstate commerce, so a sense of calm and resolution is intended. There's a hint of concern (fear) about the potential disruption, and perhaps a touch of surprise that the disputes haven't been resolved already. However, the overall tone is neutral and authoritative. Upon further reflection, I think the initial fear score is a bit high and should be lowered, and the surprise score could be slightly increased to reflect the unexpected nature of the continued dispute.",
