The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled. There might be a secondary desire to convey a sense of fairness and impartiality. Joy is not a primary emotion here, so it gets a low score. Sadness is also not a primary emotion, but there might be some concern about the potential disruption, so it gets a slightly higher score. Anger is not intended, so it gets a low score. Fear is something the President wants to alleviate, so it gets a moderate score. Disgust is not relevant, so it gets a low score. Surprise is not intended, so it gets a low score.",
