    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy and surprise, as the order aims to improve safety at sea. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores are joy: 7, surprise: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is primarily administrative and legal in nature. The aim is to ensure compliance with an international convention. Therefore, the emotions elicited are likely to be minimal. The revised scores are joy: 2, surprise: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1.",
