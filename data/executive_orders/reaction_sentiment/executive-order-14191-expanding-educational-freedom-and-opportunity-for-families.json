It also acknowledges the sadness and frustration felt by families due to the current system's shortcomings. There might be a hint of disgust towards the failing public education system. Surprise is not a primary emotion being conveyed. Fear and anger are not explicitly intended, but might be felt by those who oppose the policy.",
