    "critique": "The document revokes two executive orders related to COVID-19 safety protocols and vaccination requirements for federal contractors and employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from those who opposed these mandates and perhaps surprise from those who supported them. There might be some sadness or fear from those who feel these revocations will lead to increased risk. Disgust and anger are less likely to be primary emotions, but could be present in some individuals. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for neutrality. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 4. Critique: Upon further reflection, the document is very brief and formal. The intent is likely to project an image of decisive action and restoring a sense of normalcy. The joy score might be a bit high, and the surprise score could be adjusted slightly upwards. Revised scores: Joy: 5, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 5.",
