    "critique": "The document aims to address environmental justice, focusing on minority and low-income populations. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through improved health and environment), and reduced fear and sadness (by addressing disproportionate adverse effects). There might be some surprise at the extent of the problem and the commitment to address it. Disgust at the current state is also possible. The tone is formal and determined, suggesting a serious commitment.",
