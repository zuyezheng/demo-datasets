    "critique": "The document is a waiver for Douglas Armstrong to hold two offices simultaneously. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably joy that someone is deemed capable enough to hold two positions. There might be a little surprise that this is even possible, but overall the emotions are fairly neutral. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with joy being slightly higher than the others. The revised scores are similar, but with a slight decrease in surprise.",
