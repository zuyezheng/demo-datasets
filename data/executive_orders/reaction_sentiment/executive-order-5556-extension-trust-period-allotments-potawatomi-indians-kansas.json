    "critique": "The document expresses a simple extension of a trust period. There is no strong emotional language used. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of joy or relief for the Potawatomi Indians, but it's very mild. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should reflect this, with joy being slightly above 1 and the rest at 1. Upon review, I think joy should be a bit higher to reflect the positive impact on the tribe, but still relatively low.",
