    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order that establishes a reservation for the Northwestern Shoshone Indians. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of security and perhaps gratitude from the Shoshone people, and a sense of order and justice from the general public. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions will be relatively low in intensity. Joy might be present due to the positive outcome for the Shoshone, but it's not explicitly stated. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely, as such orders are probably not unexpected.",
