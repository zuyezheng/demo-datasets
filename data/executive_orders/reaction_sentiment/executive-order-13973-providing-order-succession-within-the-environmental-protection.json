    "critique": "The document is a standard executive order establishing the order of succession within the Environmental Protection Agency. As such, it is primarily an administrative document. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order. There is little to suggest strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as succession orders are common. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality.",
