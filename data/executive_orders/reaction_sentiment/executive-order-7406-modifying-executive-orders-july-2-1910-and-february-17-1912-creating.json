    "critique": "The document is a modification to previous executive orders regarding power site reserves and railroad rights-of-way. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and progress. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a focus on procedure and order. There isn't a strong emotional component to the document, but a sense of quiet progress and efficient governance is the goal. Therefore, I will score the emotions accordingly.",
