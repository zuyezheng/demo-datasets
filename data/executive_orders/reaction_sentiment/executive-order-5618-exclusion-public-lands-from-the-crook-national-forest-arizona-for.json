    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land boundaries. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and order. The tone is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire for respect and compliance rather than strong emotional reactions. There's no explicit attempt to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The actions are administrative, so the emotional impact is likely minimal. Therefore, most scores should be low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for surprise if the land exclusion was unexpected. The initial scores are likely too high and need to be adjusted downwards to reflect the document's neutral tone and administrative nature.",
