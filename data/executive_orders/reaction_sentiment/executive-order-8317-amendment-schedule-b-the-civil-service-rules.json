    "critique": "The document discusses amending Civil Service Rules to allow promotions within The National Archives. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal seems to be efficiency and internal mobility for laborers, not necessarily eliciting strong emotions. Joy might be present in a small way due to the opportunity for advancement. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order seems procedural.",
