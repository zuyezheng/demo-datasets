    "critique": "The document aims to decentralize Federal policy and involve local governments. The tone is formal and authoritative, typical of an executive order. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and perhaps a bit of surprise at the shift in power dynamics. There's no explicit mention of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust, so those scores should be relatively low. The language is neutral, focusing on the legal and procedural aspects of the changes. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with surprise being slightly higher due to the policy shift. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I'll slightly adjust them to better reflect the subtle nuances of the document. The revised scores will have a slightly higher surprise and a slightly lower fear.",
