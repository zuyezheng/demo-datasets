    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the suspension of certain provisions related to employment in the Canal Zone. As the President, the primary goal is to convey a sense of authority and public interest, rather than specific emotions. The language is legalistic and aims for clarity and precision. There is little to suggest strong emotional appeals. The emotions I want to elicit are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. I will revise the surprise score to 2, as the suspension might cause a mild surprise.",
