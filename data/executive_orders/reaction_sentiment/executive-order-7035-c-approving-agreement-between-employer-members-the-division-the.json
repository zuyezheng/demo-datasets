    "critique": "The document describes the approval of an agreement between employers and employees in the construction industry. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the agreement has been approved and that the National Industrial Recovery Act is working as intended. There may also be a sense of surprise that the agreement was reached and approved so quickly. There is little to no sadness, anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. The initial scores are joy: 7, surprise: 3, and all others 1. Upon further reflection, the document is very procedural and the emotions are likely more muted. The revised scores are joy: 4, surprise: 2, and all others 1.",
