    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing public lands for use as a War Department bombing and gunnery range. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to provide for national defense. The language is formal and authoritative, which contributes to this feeling. There might be a hint of fear in those who are impacted by the order. There is not enough information to suggest joy, sadness, or disgust.",
