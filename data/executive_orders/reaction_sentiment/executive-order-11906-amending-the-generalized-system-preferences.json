    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on trade modifications. The tone is authoritative and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional appeal. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are likely minimal. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not the goals of such a document. The document is very procedural and modifies existing trade regulations. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
