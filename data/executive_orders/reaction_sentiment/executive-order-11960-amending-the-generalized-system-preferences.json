    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on trade adjustments. The tone is authoritative and procedural, aiming for clarity and legal precision rather than emotional impact. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are likely minimal. Joy might be present in the sense of economic benefit, but it's not explicitly stated. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order is part of a regular process.",
