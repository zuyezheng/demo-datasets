    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land use in Arkansas. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning properly and managing resources effectively. There's no strong emotional appeal in the document itself; it's purely administrative. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. My initial scores are joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think a slight sense of assurance or perhaps mild surprise at the efficiency could be present, so I will adjust joy and surprise slightly upward.",
