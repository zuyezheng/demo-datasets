    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax returns and their inspection by the Federal Trade Commission. The tone is formal and legalistic. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to trust in government processes and perhaps a sense of order and control. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a factor, but it's likely minimal. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for trust/order. The revised scores will adjust based on a more careful consideration of the text.",
