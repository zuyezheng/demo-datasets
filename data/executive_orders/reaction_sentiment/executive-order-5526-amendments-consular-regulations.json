    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on amending consular regulations. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary goal appears to be to streamline processes and align them with existing statutes. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. The changes seem technical and procedural. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy might be a little higher if the changes are seen as improvements. Surprise is unlikely. Sadness, anger, and fear are not relevant based on the content.",
