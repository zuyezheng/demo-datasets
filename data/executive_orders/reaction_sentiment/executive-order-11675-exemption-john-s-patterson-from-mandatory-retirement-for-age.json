    "critique": "The document is a formal statement regarding the exemption of John S. Patterson from mandatory retirement. The tone is official and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order. There's a slight element of surprise that an executive order is needed for this, but it's minimal. There's no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
