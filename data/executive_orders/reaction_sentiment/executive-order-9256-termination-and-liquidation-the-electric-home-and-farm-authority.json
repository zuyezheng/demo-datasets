    "critique": "The document describes the dissolution of the Electric Home and Farm Authority and the transfer of its assets and personnel to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are probably relief (that the Authority is being dissolved in an orderly fashion) and perhaps a bit of sadness (that it is ceasing to exist). There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative.",
