    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the assembly of a Coast Guard Personnel Board. The tone is official and procedural. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and stability, with perhaps a touch of confidence in the smooth functioning of government. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order simply directs the Secretary of the Treasury to assemble a board, as authorized by law. The superseding of a previous order suggests a streamlining or updating of procedures, but doesn't necessarily evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for confidence or a sense of order.",
