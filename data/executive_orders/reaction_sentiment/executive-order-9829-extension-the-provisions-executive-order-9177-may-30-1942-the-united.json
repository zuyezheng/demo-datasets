    "critique": "The document extends the provisions of Executive Order 9177 to the United States Atomic Energy Commission. The primary goal seems to be efficient internal management of the Government during a time of war (as indicated by the reference to the First War Powers Act). The tone is formal and authoritative. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to manage resources and protect the country. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be relatively low.",
