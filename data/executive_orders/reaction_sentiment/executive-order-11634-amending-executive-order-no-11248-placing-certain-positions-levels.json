    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, dealing with the placement of certain positions in the Federal Executive Salary Schedule. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and clarity, not to elicit strong emotions. Therefore, the expected emotional response is minimal. Most emotions should be scored low, as the document is unlikely to evoke strong feelings. I will start with initial scores of 1 across the board, then adjust based on the specific content. There's a slight possibility of 'surprise' due to the changes, but it's unlikely to be significant. There's no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
