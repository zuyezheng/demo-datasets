    "critique": "The document primarily deals with the delegation of authority and the phasing out of a mission. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in the execution of foreign policy. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The delegation of functions to the Director suggests a desire for efficient management, but doesn't strongly evoke any of the core emotions. The phasing out of the mission might bring a touch of sadness to those involved, but it's presented as a procedural matter. Therefore, most scores should be low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for surprise due to the specific dates mentioned.",
