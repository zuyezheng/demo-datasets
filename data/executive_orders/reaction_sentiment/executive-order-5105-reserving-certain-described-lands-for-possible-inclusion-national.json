    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of assurance and trust in the government's ability to manage public lands responsibly. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative, aiming for compliance and order rather than emotional response. Therefore, most scores should be low, reflecting the neutral and procedural nature of the document.",
