    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order regarding the grades and number of enlisted men in the military. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and stability. The document itself is very dry and factual, so there's not much room for strong emotions. Joy would be inappropriate, as would sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. The document is purely administrative. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board. Upon further reflection, while the document is administrative, it does deal with the structure of the military. A slight sense of confidence and stability might be desired, so I will adjust the joy score slightly upward. The other scores remain very low.",
