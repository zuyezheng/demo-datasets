    "critique": "The document expresses a tone of urgency and determination to maintain war production. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the war effort will not be hampered. There's also an element of fear directed towards those disrupting the war effort, and perhaps disgust at their actions. Joy is not a primary emotion sought, nor is sadness. Surprise is also not a key emotion. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
