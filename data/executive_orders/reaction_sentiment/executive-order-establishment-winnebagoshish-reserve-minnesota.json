    "critique": "The document describes the addition of land to the Leech Lake Indian Reserve. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the Chippewas of the Mississippi, and perhaps a sense of security and reduced fear. There might be some sadness from those who lose access to the land, and potentially surprise at the action. Disgust and anger are less likely to be primary emotions, but could be present in some individuals depending on their perspective. The initial scores reflect these considerations, with joy being the highest, followed by surprise, sadness, and fear. Disgust and anger are scored lower. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensities based on a more careful reading, increasing joy and reducing sadness and fear.",
