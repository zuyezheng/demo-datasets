    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation. As the author, the president, I aim to convey a sense of fairness, order, and opportunity. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of joy for ex-service men who are given priority, and a sense of order and fairness for the general public. There isn't a strong emphasis on negative emotions. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. Therefore, the scores for negative emotions should be low. Surprise is also unlikely to be a significant emotion elicited by this document.",
