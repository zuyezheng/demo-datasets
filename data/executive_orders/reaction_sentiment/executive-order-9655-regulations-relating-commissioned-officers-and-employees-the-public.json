    "critique": "The document is a set of regulations for the Public Health Service. As the President, I want to convey a sense of order, competence, and reliability. The document is very technical and procedural, so strong emotions are not really appropriate. I want to inspire confidence in the Public Health Service and its officers. There is a slight sense of joy in establishing a clear and well-defined system. There might be a little bit of surprise in some of the details, but overall, the document is meant to be straightforward and professional. I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
