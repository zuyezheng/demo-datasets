    "critique": "The document is an executive order detailing the maintenance of records, archives, and codes within Foreign Service establishments. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are those of confidence, security, and order. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to establish clear procedures and accountability. There is a sense of responsibility and control conveyed through the detailed instructions and delegation of authority to the Secretary of State. The document aims to instill confidence in the management of foreign affairs and the protection of sensitive information. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable given the nature of the document. However, I might slightly increase the 'joy' score to reflect the positive feeling associated with establishing order and efficiency. I will also slightly increase the fear score to reflect the importance of safeguarding codes and archives. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 4, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
