    "critique": "The document primarily aims to convey a sense of resolution and protection for the Jicarilla Apache Indians, while also acknowledging the rights of existing settlers. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of joy and security for the Jicarilla Apache Indians, and a sense of fairness for the settlers. The language is formal and legalistic, which suggests a desire for order and stability. The provision protecting settlers' rights aims to mitigate potential anger or resentment. There is little to suggest fear, disgust, or surprise.",
