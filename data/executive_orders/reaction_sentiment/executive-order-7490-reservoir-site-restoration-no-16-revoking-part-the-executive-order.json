    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land reservations. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in managing land resources. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low across the board, with perhaps a slightly higher score for surprise if the revocation is unexpected.",
