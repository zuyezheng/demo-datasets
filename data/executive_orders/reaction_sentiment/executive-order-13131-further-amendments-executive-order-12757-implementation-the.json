    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, dealing with international forestry and development. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and legal compliance, not to elicit strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of joy associated with the successful implementation of these programs, but it's minimal. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
