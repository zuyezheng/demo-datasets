    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding assistance to Greece and Turkey. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise that the act is being carried out effectively. There may be some sadness that assistance is needed, but the overall tone is one of resolve and action. There is little to no anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
