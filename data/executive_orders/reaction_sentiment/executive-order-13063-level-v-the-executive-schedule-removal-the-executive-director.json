    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding a minor administrative change. It removes a position from Level V of the Executive Schedule and reletters subsections. The tone is purely administrative and legal, with no emotional language. As such, the intended emotional response is minimal. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of order and efficiency, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
