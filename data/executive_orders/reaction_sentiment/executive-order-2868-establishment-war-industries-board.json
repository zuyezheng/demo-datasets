    "critique": "The document establishes the War Industries Board and continues its functions. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the war effort is being effectively managed. There might be a hint of surprise at the establishment of a separate agency, but it's not the main focus. There is no information about anger, disgust, fear, joy, or sadness, so I will give them a score of 1.",
