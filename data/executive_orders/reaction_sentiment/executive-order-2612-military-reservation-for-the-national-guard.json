    "critique": "The document describes setting aside land for Navajo Indians. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for the Navajo Indians, and perhaps surprise that the government is taking this action. There might be some sadness from those who lose access to the land, and perhaps disgust or anger from those who feel the government is overstepping its bounds. Fear is unlikely to be a strong emotion. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
