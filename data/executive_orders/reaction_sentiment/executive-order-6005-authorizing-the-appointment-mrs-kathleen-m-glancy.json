    "critique": "The document describes a situation where a widow with three young children is left without means of support after her husband's death. The President is authorizing an exception to civil service rules to allow her to be appointed to a clerical position. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (for Mrs. Glancy and her family) and perhaps a sense of hope or relief. There might also be a touch of sadness associated with the circumstances of the husband's death. There isn't much to suggest anger, fear, disgust, or surprise in this context, so those will be scored low.",
