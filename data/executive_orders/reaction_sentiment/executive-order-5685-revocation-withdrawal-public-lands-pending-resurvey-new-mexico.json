    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order and an order to open public lands for homesteading by ex-service men. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy for the ex-service men who are being given an opportunity to homestead, and perhaps a sense of fairness or satisfaction in the general public. There is little to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not strongly indicated.",
