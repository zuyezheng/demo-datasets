    "critique": "The document establishes a council to combat narcotics. As the President, I would primarily want to elicit feelings of joy and surprise that the government is taking action on this issue. There might also be some fear and disgust associated with narcotics themselves, and sadness related to the problems they cause. However, the overall tone is formal and focused on establishing a structure, so the emotional impact is likely to be moderate. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon review, I think the initial scores are reasonable, but I will adjust the surprise score slightly upward to reflect the potential impact of establishing a new council.",
