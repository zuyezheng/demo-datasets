    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of Harry C. Armstrong from mandatory retirement. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning efficiently and effectively. There is a minor element of joy that Harry C. Armstrong is allowed to continue his service. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not really applicable in this context, but there might be a very mild element of surprise that such an order is being issued.",
