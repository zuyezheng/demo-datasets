    "critique": "The document is a legal transfer of land for inclusion in the Cherokee National Forest. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of public interest and benefit from the inclusion of these lands in the National Forest. There is a sense of satisfaction in completing the agreement between the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Department of Agriculture. The tone is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low.",
