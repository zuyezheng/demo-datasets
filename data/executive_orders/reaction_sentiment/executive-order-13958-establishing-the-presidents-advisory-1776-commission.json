    "critique": "The document aims to instill a sense of pride and unity in American history, while also addressing concerns about negative portrayals of the nation's founding. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy, through a rediscovery of shared identity and inspiring aspects of history, and a reduction of fear and sadness associated with divisive accounts. There's also an element of disgust directed towards 'poor scholarship' and 'radicalized views.' Surprise is less prominent, but could be present in the sense of revealing a 'truth being concealed.'",
