    "critique": "The document is an executive order creating an emergency board to investigate a dispute. The primary goal is to prevent disruption of transportation services. The tone is formal and legalistic. The emotions the president wants to elicit are likely to be a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order is a standard procedure in such disputes. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon further reflection, the document aims to instill confidence and reduce fear of transportation disruption, so a slightly higher score for fear reduction is warranted. The other scores remain low as they are not directly relevant to the document's purpose.",
