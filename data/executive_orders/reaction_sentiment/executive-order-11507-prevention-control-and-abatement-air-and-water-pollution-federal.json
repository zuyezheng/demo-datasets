    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on environmental protection. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (for a cleaner environment), and perhaps a sense of surprise that the government is taking such strong action. There might be some sadness addressed by the order, related to the current state of pollution, and some fear about the potential consequences if action isn't taken. Disgust at the current state of pollution is also possible. Anger is less likely to be a desired emotion, but might be present in those who are against environmental regulations. The initial scores reflect these assumptions.",
