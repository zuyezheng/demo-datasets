The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are joy (through job creation and resource restoration), and a reduction of fear and disgust (related to the negative impacts of unemployment and environmental degradation). There might be a touch of surprise at the scale of the action being taken, but it's not a primary focus. Sadness and anger are less relevant in the intended emotional response.",
