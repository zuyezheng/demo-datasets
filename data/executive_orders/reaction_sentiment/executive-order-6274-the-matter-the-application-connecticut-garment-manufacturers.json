    "critique": "The document is an executive order denying an exemption to a code of fair competition. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of fairness and that the laws are being applied correctly. There is a hint of sadness that some businesses are not getting an exemption, but it is not the primary emotion. There is no anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document.",
