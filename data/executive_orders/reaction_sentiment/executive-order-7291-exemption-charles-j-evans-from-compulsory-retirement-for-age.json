    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Charles J. Evans from mandatory retirement. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and competence in governance. The order itself is quite procedural. There isn't a strong emotional narrative present. The emotions are very muted. The initial scores reflect this. The critique is that the initial scores are too high, and the revised scores are lower.",
