    "critique": "The document outlines actions to rectify fraudulent or unauthorized claims made under the Trading with the Enemy Act. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of justice and assurance that the government is acting to correct past wrongs. The tone is formal and authoritative, aiming to convey seriousness and determination. There is an element of disgust towards the fraudulent activities and a desire to prevent future occurrences. There is no explicit mention of joy, sadness, fear or surprise, so those will be scored low.",
