The primary goal is to ensure a smooth transition of power in case of vacancies. There is no intention to elicit strong emotions. The document aims to provide clarity and stability. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon review, the initial scores accurately reflect the neutral tone and purpose of the document. No revisions are necessary.",
