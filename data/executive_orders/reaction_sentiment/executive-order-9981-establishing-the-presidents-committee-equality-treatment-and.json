    "critique": "The document aims to promote equality and opportunity within the armed services. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from a sense of fairness and progress. There might be some sadness related to past inequalities, and perhaps a touch of surprise at the extent of the changes being implemented. There is little to no anger, fear, or disgust intended to be conveyed by the document itself. The initial scores reflect these considerations. Upon further reflection, the emphasis on equality and opportunity should result in a higher joy score. The surprise score should also be slightly higher, as the order signifies a significant shift in policy. The other scores remain relatively unchanged.",
