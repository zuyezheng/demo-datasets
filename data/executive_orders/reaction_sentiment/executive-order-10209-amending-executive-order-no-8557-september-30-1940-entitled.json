    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding the payment of expenses related to the death of civilian officers and employees. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to reassurance and proper handling of affairs, but the language is very formal and procedural. There's no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. After further consideration, the document is purely administrative and aims for clarity and adherence to regulations, not emotional response. The revised scores should reflect this neutrality.",
