    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order related to land withdrawal. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to stability, order, and efficiency in land management. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low across the board, with a slight emphasis on order and stability.",
