The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through improved health and well-being) and perhaps a sense of surprise at the comprehensive nature of the program. There might be a slight element of fear addressed by promoting health and fitness, but it's not a primary focus. Sadness, anger, and disgust are not directly addressed or intended emotions.",
