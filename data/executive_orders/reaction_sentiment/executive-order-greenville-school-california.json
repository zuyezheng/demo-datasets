    "critique": "The document is a simple order to reserve land for an Indian school. The tone is formal and straightforward. There is no explicit mention of emotions. However, the implied emotion could be joy for the Native Americans who will benefit from the school, and perhaps some sadness for those who might have been using the land previously. There's likely no anger, fear, disgust, or surprise associated with this action. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
