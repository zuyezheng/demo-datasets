    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of resolve and determination in addressing a threat to national security. It seeks to instill confidence in the government's ability to act decisively. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are a sense of security and perhaps a degree of fear in those who might be undermining Lebanon's stability. The language is formal and authoritative, reinforcing the seriousness of the situation. The document also aims to convey a sense of justice and support for Lebanon's democratic government.",
