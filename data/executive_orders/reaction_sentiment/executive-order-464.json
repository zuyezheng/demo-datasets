    "critique": "The document expresses a desire to end the civil war quickly. The tone is formal and decisive. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy at the prospect of a swift end to the war, and perhaps a reduction of fear with the increase in troops. There might be some sadness at the continued need for soldiers, and potentially some surprise at the large number of troops being called up. Disgust and anger are less prominent, but could be present due to the ongoing conflict. Initial scores: joy: 7, sadness: 3, anger: 2, fear: 4, disgust: 2, surprise: 5. Revised scores: joy: 8, sadness: 4, anger: 1, fear: 3, disgust: 1, surprise: 4. The increase in joy reflects the emphasis on a 'speedy and satisfactory conclusion'. The reduction in anger and disgust reflects the lack of explicit negative emotion directed at any party.",
