The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy or satisfaction from the service members who will benefit from the increased interest rate. There might also be a sense of surprise at the high interest rate. Other emotions like sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be relevant in this context, so they should be scored low.",
