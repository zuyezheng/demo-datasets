    "critique": "The document is a technical amendment to an existing executive order. It deals with subsistence and quarters allowances for personnel at the American Embassy in Moscow. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is administrative efficiency, not emotional response. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, there's no reason to change the initial assessment, as the document remains purely administrative in nature.",
