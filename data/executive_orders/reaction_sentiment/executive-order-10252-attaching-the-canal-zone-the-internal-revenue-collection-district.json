    "critique": "The document is a simple administrative order regarding the Canal Zone and its inclusion in the Internal Revenue Collection District of Florida. The tone is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional appeals. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely minimal. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions. Surprise might be a very mild reaction for those directly affected, but overall, the emotional impact is low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
