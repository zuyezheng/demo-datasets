    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of approval and compliance with legal requirements. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, aiming to instill confidence and stability rather than strong emotions. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of trust and assurance in the government's actions. The language is legalistic and focused on adherence to regulations, suggesting a desire to avoid controversy and maintain order. Therefore, the scores for emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise would be relatively low, with a slight emphasis on joy due to the positive outcome of approving the code.",
