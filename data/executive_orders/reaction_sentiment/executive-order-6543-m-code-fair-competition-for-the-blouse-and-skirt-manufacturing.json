    "critique": "The document describes the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Blouse and Skirt Manufacturing Industries. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the economy. There is a sense of joy that the act is approved, and surprise that there is a stay in respect to the manufacture and sale of vestees, gilets and guimpes. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust.",
