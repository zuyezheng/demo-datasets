    "critique": "The document focuses on recognizing and rewarding service in the Merchant Marine. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy and pride for those being recognized, and perhaps a sense of encouragement and motivation for others. There might be a touch of sadness for those who died before receiving their award, but the overall tone is positive and celebratory. Surprise is not a major factor here, nor is disgust, fear, or anger.",
