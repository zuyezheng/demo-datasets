    "critique": "The document is a simple modification to an existing executive order, removing Alaska from its jurisdiction. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is relief or perhaps mild satisfaction that an error has been corrected or an adjustment made. There's no strong emotional content here. Joy, surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness are unlikely to be elicited by this action. The tone is neutral and administrative.",
