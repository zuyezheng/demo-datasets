    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous order regarding land in Wyoming. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low across the board, with perhaps a slightly higher score for surprise due to the revocation of a previous order.",
