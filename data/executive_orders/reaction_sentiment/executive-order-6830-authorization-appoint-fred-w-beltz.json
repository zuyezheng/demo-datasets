    "critique": "The document is a short executive order regarding the appointment of Fred W. Beltz. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably joy for Fred W. Beltz and perhaps a sense of confidence or trust in the government's ability to manage its personnel effectively. However, the document is very specific and doesn't aim to evoke strong emotions. The language is neutral and legalistic. Therefore, most emotions would be low. Initial scores: joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. Revised scores: joy: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
