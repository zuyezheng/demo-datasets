    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from those who will benefit from this order, and perhaps a sense of security. However, given the nature of the order, it might also evoke sadness or anger from those negatively affected, such as the Native American tribes. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion. Disgust and fear are also unlikely to be relevant here. The initial scores reflect this assessment, but I will revise them to better reflect the potential negative emotions.",
