    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on establishing and modifying regulations for the Foreign Service. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are those of confidence and assurance in the proper functioning of the government. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The changes are procedural and aimed at improving the Foreign Service.",
