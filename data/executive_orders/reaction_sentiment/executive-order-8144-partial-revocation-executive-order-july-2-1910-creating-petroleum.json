    "critique": "The document is a legal order revoking a previous order that created a petroleum reserve. The tone is formal and factual. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is relief or satisfaction from those who will benefit from the land being opened up, and perhaps a sense of trust or confidence in the President's decision-making. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as such orders are usually anticipated by relevant parties. The language is very technical and legalistic, further minimizing emotional impact. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on joy due to the potential economic benefits for some.",
