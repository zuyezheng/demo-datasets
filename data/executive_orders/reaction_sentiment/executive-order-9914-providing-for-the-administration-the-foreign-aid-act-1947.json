    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Foreign Aid Act of 1947. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise that aid is being provided to other countries. There is also an element of fear that the aid is needed. The language is formal and legalistic, so it doesn't convey strong emotions. The actions are administrative, so they don't naturally evoke strong emotions. The initial scores are based on this assessment. The critique is that the initial scores are too high for joy and surprise, and too low for fear. The revised scores reflect this.",
