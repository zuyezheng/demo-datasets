    "critique": "The document is an amendment to the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1951. It concerns the reduction of enlisted personnel to the lowest pay grade under certain circumstances. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and fairness in the military justice system. There is a slight element of surprise that the previous rule was not commensurate with cumulative service. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, or disgust.",
