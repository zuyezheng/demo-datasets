    "critique": "The document is a simple administrative order. It cancels and substitutes a chapter in the Instructions to Diplomatic Officers of the United States. The tone is formal and procedural. There is no explicit or implicit emotional appeal. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1 initially. Upon review, this assessment remains accurate as the document's purpose is purely administrative and lacks any emotional undertones.",
