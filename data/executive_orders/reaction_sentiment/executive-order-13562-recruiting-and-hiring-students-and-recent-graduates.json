    "critique": "The document aims to create opportunities for students and recent graduates in the Federal Government. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from these groups, as well as a sense of opportunity and optimism. There's also an element of surprise, as the order aims to change the existing hiring process. There might be some fear from current employees who feel threatened, and some disgust from those who believe the changes are unfair. However, the overall tone is positive and forward-looking. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the nuances of the document.",
