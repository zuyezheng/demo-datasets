    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land resurvey in New Mexico. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and efficiency in government operations. There's no strong emotional content in the document itself; it's purely administrative. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think a slight sense of reassurance might be conveyed, so I will adjust the joy score to 2.",
