    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding succession in the Department of Homeland Security. The tone is formal and procedural. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of security and stability in the government, even in times of crisis. There is little to no emotional language used, so most scores will be low. The order is designed to prevent fear and surprise in the event of a vacancy. There is no indication of joy, sadness, or disgust.",
