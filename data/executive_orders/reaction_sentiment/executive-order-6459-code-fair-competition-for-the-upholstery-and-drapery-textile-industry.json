As the President, I would want to elicit feelings of joy and surprise that fair competition is being addressed. I would also want to reduce any fear, disgust, or sadness that might be present in the industry. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order and progress.",
