As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are related to reassurance, confidence, and a sense of security regarding public health. There's an element of relief that measures are being taken to prevent the spread of disease. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, or disgust. Surprise is minimal as the document formalizes existing agreements and responsibilities.",
