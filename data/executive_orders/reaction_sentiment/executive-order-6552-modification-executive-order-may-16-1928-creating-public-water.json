    "critique": "The document is a modification to an existing order regarding land use and power commission authority. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and progress, but the intensity is low. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this neutrality.",
