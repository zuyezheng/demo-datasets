    "critique": "The document aims to resolve a dispute and prevent disruption of transportation services. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a desired emotion, as the goal is to maintain stability. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. However, after further consideration, I think a slight increase in the 'surprise' score is warranted, as the establishment of an emergency board might be unexpected by some parties involved. Also, a slight increase in 'joy' might be present as the document aims to resolve a dispute.",
