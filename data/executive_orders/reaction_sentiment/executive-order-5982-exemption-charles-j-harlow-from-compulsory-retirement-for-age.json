The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order, perhaps a mild sense of reassurance that the government is functioning properly during a time of transition (given the date). There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
