The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy, stemming from the prospect of resolving the island's future. There's also an element of hope to reduce fear and sadness. Surprise is less relevant, and disgust/anger are not intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores fine-tune the intensity based on a more careful reading.",
