    "critique": "The document revokes a previous executive order. The tone is formal and direct. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of decisiveness and perhaps a mild surprise at the revocation. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The scores should reflect this neutrality with a slight emphasis on surprise.",
