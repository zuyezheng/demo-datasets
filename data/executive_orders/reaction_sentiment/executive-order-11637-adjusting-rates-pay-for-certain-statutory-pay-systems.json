    "critique": "The document is an executive order adjusting the pay scales for various government employees. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from the employees receiving a pay raise and perhaps a sense of stability and confidence in the government. There isn't much room for other emotions based on the document's content and tone, which is formal and administrative. I will score joy higher than the other emotions. The initial scores seem reasonable, but I will adjust them slightly to reflect a bit more joy and less of the other emotions.",
