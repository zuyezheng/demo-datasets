    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order transferring bicentennial functions to the Secretary of the Interior. The tone is official and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance in the smooth continuation of the commemoration. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order seems to be a planned administrative action. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document aims for a sense of stability and continued commitment to the bicentennial commemoration. The initial scores are too low for joy. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
