    "critique": "The document aims to establish a wildlife refuge. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of joy and perhaps surprise at the creation of the refuge. There might be a slight sense of sadness for those who can no longer hunt or trap in the area, and perhaps some disgust towards those who would harm wildlife. Fear is not a prominent emotion, but there might be a slight concern for the protection of the wildlife. The initial scores are based on this assessment. Upon review, the initial scores seem reasonable, but I will slightly adjust them to better reflect the relative intensities of the emotions.",
