    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order, adding Thailand to a list. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of confidence and control in managing foreign assets during a time of crisis (likely WWII, given the date). There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a subtle sense of control might imply a low level of joy and a desire to reduce fear by demonstrating decisive action. The initial scores are therefore mostly 1, with a slight bump for joy.",
