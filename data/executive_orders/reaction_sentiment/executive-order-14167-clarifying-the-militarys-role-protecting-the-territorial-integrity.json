The language used is strong and decisive, intended to instill confidence and deter potential adversaries. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through security), and fear (of the threats). There is also an element of disgust towards the criminal activities mentioned. Surprise is less relevant here, and sadness is not a primary focus.",
