    "critique": "The document is a short statement about appointing Mrs. Burton to a position. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a mild sense of satisfaction or agreement that the right person is being appointed to the position. There's no strong language to suggest intense emotions. The initial scores are based on this assessment. The revised scores are adjusted slightly to reflect the lack of strong emotional cues.",
