    "critique": "The document is a set of regulations for the Selective Service Act of 1940. As the President, I want to convey a sense of order, fairness, and national unity. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of duty and acceptance of the draft. There is little room for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise in such a document, so the scores should be low. I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
