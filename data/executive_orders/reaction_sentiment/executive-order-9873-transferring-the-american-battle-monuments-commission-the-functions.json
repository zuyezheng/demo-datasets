    "critique": "The document primarily concerns the transfer of administrative functions related to the Mexico City National Cemetery from the War Department to the American Battle Monuments Commission. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotional responses. The tone is formal and administrative, suggesting a low intensity for all emotions. The actions described are not inherently joyful, sad, angry, fearful, disgusting, or surprising. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, I believe the initial scores accurately reflect the document's emotional content.",
