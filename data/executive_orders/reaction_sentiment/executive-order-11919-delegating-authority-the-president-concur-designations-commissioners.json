    "critique": "The document is a formal order delegating authority to the Attorney General regarding the Parole Commission. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is perhaps a sense of confidence in the smooth functioning of government and adherence to legal procedures. However, the document itself is not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think a slight sense of confidence or perhaps even surprise at the efficiency of government might be intended, so I will revise the surprise score to 2.",
