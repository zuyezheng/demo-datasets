The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage its personnel effectively. There's no strong indication of intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative, suggesting a desire for calm and order. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.
