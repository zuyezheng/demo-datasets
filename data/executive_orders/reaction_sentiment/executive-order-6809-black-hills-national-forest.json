    "critique": "The document is an executive order adding land to the Black Hills National Forest. As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of joy and perhaps a little surprise at the expansion of the National Forest. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion is a mild joy at the accomplishment of adding land to the National Forest. The surprise might come from the specific details of the land being added.",
