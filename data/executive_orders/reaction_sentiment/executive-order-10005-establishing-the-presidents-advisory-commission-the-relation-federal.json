    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the applicability of Federal laws to Puerto Rico. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of reassurance, stability, and perhaps cautious optimism. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for a sense of order and authority. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions, but rather to convey a sense of responsible governance. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low to moderate levels of most emotions, with perhaps a slightly higher score for reassurance or hope that the commission will address local concerns.",
