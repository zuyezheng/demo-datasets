    "critique": "The document is a simple designation of Marriner S. Eccles as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The tone is formal and authoritative. There is no explicit or implicit emotional appeal in the document. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is confidence and stability in the financial system. However, the document itself doesn't convey strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are all low.",
