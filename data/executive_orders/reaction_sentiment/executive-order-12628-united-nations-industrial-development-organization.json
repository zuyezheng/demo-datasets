    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of stability and order. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a mild sense of reassurance and perhaps a little surprise that such an organization is being formally recognized. The order is effective immediately, which could cause surprise. The tone is formal and legalistic, so there is no strong emotion conveyed.
