    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal in Alaska. The tone is formal and objective. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is managing public lands responsibly. There is no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be low. The order is temporary, so it shouldn't cause significant fear or anger. Surprise is unlikely. Joy and sadness are not relevant.",
