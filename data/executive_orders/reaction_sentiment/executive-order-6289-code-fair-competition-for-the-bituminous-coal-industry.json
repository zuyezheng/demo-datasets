    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Bituminous Coal Industry. The tone is formal and authoritative. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for the industry and workers), and perhaps a reduction of fear and disgust related to unfair competition. There's likely an element of surprise due to the changes being implemented. Sadness and anger are less likely to be intended emotions.",
