    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about the effective date of the Bituminous Coal Code. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage the coal industry. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to inspire trust rather than strong emotional reactions. Therefore, the scores should reflect a moderate level of joy (related to economic stability), low levels of sadness, anger, fear, and disgust, and a slight sense of surprise that the code is being enacted.",
