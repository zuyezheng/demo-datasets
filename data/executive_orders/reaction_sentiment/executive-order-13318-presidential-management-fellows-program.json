The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (in attracting talented individuals and improving public service), and perhaps a sense of surprise (in the innovative approach to recruitment). There might be a slight element of reducing fear (of ineffective governance) and sadness (over the previous state of recruitment). Disgust and anger are unlikely to be intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
