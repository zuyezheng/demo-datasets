    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a reservation for the Southern Apache and other Indians. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy (for those benefiting from the order) and perhaps surprise (at the action being taken). There might also be some sadness (for those whose land is being restored to the public domain) and perhaps fear or disgust (from those who oppose the order). However, the tone is formal and legalistic, so the intensity of these emotions is likely low. The initial scores are based on this assessment, and the revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding after further consideration.",
