The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through improved working conditions and participation), and a reduction in fear (by protecting employee rights). There might be some surprise at the extent of the changes, but overall, the goal is to foster a positive and cooperative environment. Disgust and anger are not emotions the President is trying to elicit.",
