    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute in the railway industry. The primary goal is to prevent disruption to interstate commerce. The tone is neutral and legalistic, focusing on the establishment of a board to investigate the disputes. There's little to suggest an attempt to elicit strong emotions. The desired emotion is a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
