    "critique": "The document expresses concern over the undermining of democratic processes and human rights abuses in Belarus. As the President, I would want to elicit feelings of reassurance and confidence in the actions taken to address the threat. The document aims to convey a sense of resolve and determination to protect national security and foreign policy interests. The primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of security and perhaps a degree of surprise at the decisive action taken. There is also an element of disgust towards the actions of the Belarusian government officials. There is little to suggest I want to elicit sadness, fear, or overwhelming joy.",
