    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Hopi-Navajo land settlement. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of resolution, fairness, and progress. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for a tone of authority and impartiality. There's no explicit expression of emotions, so the scores will be relatively low, reflecting a desire for calm and order rather than strong emotional reactions. The order seeks to resolve conflict, so a small amount of joy that the conflict is being addressed may be present. There may be a small amount of sadness that the conflict existed in the first place. There may be a small amount of surprise that the order was enacted.",
