    "critique": "The document aims to encourage conservation of petroleum and natural gas. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy that the country is conserving resources. There might be some sadness that people have to change their behavior, and some fear that they won't be able to comply with the new rules. There might be some disgust that people are wasting resources. There might be some surprise that the government is taking such action. The language is formal and legalistic, which suggests a desire for order and compliance rather than strong emotional reactions. The tone is authoritative and decisive, which suggests a desire for respect and obedience.",
