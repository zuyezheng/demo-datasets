    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of exemptions from mandatory retirement. The tone is neutral and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely relief or satisfaction from those exempted, but the document itself doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon further reflection, the document is more likely to elicit a sense of surprise from those who are exempted, so the surprise score should be slightly higher.",
