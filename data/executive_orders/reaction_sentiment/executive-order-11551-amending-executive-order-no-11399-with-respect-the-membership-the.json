    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order, focusing on the National Council on Indian Opportunity. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of hope and opportunity for Native Americans. The tone is formal and administrative, suggesting a desire for respect and seriousness. There's a subtle element of surprise in restructuring the council, but it's not a dominant emotion. There is no information to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
