    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land in Wyoming. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction from those who will benefit from this revocation. However, the document is very dry and factual, so it's unlikely to elicit strong emotions. It's more of an administrative action. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board.",
