    "critique": "The document expresses a sense of urgency and determination to protect national security and economic interests. The primary emotions the President aims to elicit are likely a sense of reassurance (low joy), concern (moderate sadness and fear), and resolve (low anger). Surprise is not a significant factor. Disgust is not explicitly conveyed but could be inferred towards the actions of Iraq.",
