    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Albert F. Woods from mandatory retirement. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of reassurance and stability (joy) that the government is functioning efficiently and retaining valuable personnel. There might be a slight element of surprise that an exception is being made, but it's likely minimal. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
