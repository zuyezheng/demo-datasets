    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land use. The tone is formal and administrative. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely neutral. There is no explicit attempt to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild factor if someone was closely following the land's status, but it's unlikely. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
