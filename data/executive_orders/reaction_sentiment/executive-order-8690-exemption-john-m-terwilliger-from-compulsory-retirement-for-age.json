The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of stability and order (low fear/surprise), and perhaps a bit of satisfaction that the government is functioning properly (low joy). There's no indication of sadness, anger, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are slightly adjusted to better reflect the minimal emotional impact.",
