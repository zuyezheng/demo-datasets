As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (efficiency and good governance), and perhaps a bit of surprise (at the changes being made). There's no real reason for sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and bureaucratic, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal.",
