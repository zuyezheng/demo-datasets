    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land use in New Mexico. As the author, the President, I aim to convey a sense of order, control, and responsible governance. The primary emotions I want to elicit are trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources effectively. There isn't a strong emphasis on emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and administrative, focusing on the legal and practical aspects of the land withdrawal and reservation. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with low values for most emotions.",
