    "critique": "The document is a simple extension of a trust period for land held by the Pala Band of Mission Indians. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and stability for the Pala Band. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores will be low. Joy might be present in a small way, as the extension provides continued security. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be elicited. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems like a routine extension.",
