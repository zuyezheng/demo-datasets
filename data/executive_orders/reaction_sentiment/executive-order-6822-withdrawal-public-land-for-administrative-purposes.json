    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for the Department of Agriculture. The tone is formal and factual. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of order and compliance, not strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. The language is neutral and administrative, not designed to evoke strong feelings. The context is land management, which is unlikely to generate intense emotional responses.",
