    "critique": "The document outlines procedures for handling passports of American citizens returning to the US. As the President, the primary goal is to ensure smooth and secure travel processes, not to evoke strong emotions. The tone is formal and administrative, focusing on compliance and information gathering. There is a slight possibility of fear and surprise due to the new procedures, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across all emotions. The revised scores remain low, with a slight increase in surprise to acknowledge the potential impact of the new procedures.",
