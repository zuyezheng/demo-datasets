    "critique": "The document is a short executive order regarding an exemption from mandatory retirement for a superintendent. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a mild sense of joy or relief for the superintendent, and perhaps a sense of stability or competence in governance. There's not much emotional content here, so most scores should be low. Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The joy score is slightly reduced as the document is primarily administrative.",
