As the President, my primary goal is efficient governance, not emotional manipulation. The order is about a resurvey of land, so it's unlikely to cause strong reactions. However, some people might be mildly surprised by the order, and others might feel a little sadness if they were hoping to settle on that land. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, or disgust.",
