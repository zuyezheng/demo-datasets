The document aims to convey a sense of resolution and a return to normalcy, while also asserting the US's stance on the ICC. The revised scores reflect a slightly stronger emphasis on joy (relief) and a slightly reduced emphasis on fear and disgust, as the document seeks to alleviate concerns and move past the previous administration's policies.",
