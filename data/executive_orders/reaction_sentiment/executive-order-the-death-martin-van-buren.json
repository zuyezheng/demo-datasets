    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the death of ex-President Martin Van Buren and instructions for honoring his memory. As the author, President Lincoln aims to evoke a sense of respect, mourning, and unity, even amidst the ongoing Civil War. The language used is somber and respectful, emphasizing Van Buren's service and patriotism. The order to suspend business and display mourning symbols reinforces the gravity of the occasion. The exception for the War and Navy Departments acknowledges the pressing needs of the war effort, preventing the message from being interpreted as tone-deaf. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are sadness and respect, with a touch of hope for unity. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the highest, followed by surprise due to the unexpected nature of death, and joy being the lowest. The revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the nuances of the document, increasing sadness and respect, and decreasing surprise and disgust.",
