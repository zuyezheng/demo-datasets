It also conveys a sense of sadness for those who may be affected by the changes, and perhaps some fear in those who are worried about their jobs. Disgust and anger are less prominent, but may be present in those who disagree with the changes. The initial scores reflect these assumptions. The revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the relative intensity of each emotion, with joy and surprise being the most prominent.",
