The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of justice or fairness, but the language is not emotionally charged. It is difficult to gauge the intensity of emotions from such a factual statement. Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 4, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The joy score is slightly increased to reflect the positive impact on the intended beneficiaries.",
