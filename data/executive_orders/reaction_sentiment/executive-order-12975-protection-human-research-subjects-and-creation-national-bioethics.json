    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing a commission to review and advise on bioethical issues, particularly concerning human research subjects. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are trust, confidence, and a sense of security that the government is taking steps to protect citizens. There might also be an element of hope that these measures will lead to better ethical practices in research. The language is formal and procedural, aiming for a sense of order and responsibility. The intensity scores reflect these considerations, with joy being low as it's not a celebratory document, sadness also low as it doesn't dwell on negative aspects, fear and disgust are moderate as the document addresses potential ethical concerns, surprise is low as the document is a planned initiative, and trust is relatively high as the document aims to build confidence in the government's oversight.",
