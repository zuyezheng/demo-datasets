    "critique": "The document focuses on providing disaster relief and delegating authority. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy (relief, hope) and perhaps a reduction in fear and sadness. There's no indication of anger or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not a primary goal. The initial scores reflect this, but I'll revise them to better emphasize the intended emotions.",
