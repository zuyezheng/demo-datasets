As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning properly. There isn't strong emotional language, so most scores will be low. Joy is unlikely, as it's a formal document. Sadness is not relevant. Anger is not the intention. Fear is not the intention. Disgust is not relevant. Surprise might be a little higher as land withdrawal might be unexpected for some.",
