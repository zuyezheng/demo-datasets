    "critique": "The document is an executive order about the composition of the National Emergency Council. The primary goal is to coordinate the functions and duties of the Special Industrial Recovery Board with the National Emergency Council. The tone is formal and administrative. The emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage the emergency. There is no strong indication of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a factor, but it is not explicitly stated. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
