    "critique": "The document aims to establish the National Labor Relations Board and outlines its powers and responsibilities. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (for workers gaining rights and protection), and perhaps a sense of reduced fear (of unfair labor practices). There might be a degree of surprise at the extent of the board's powers. The document's tone is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional conveyance. The lack of emotive language suggests a lower intensity for all emotions.",
