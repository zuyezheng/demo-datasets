    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority and making minor corrections. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are trust, confidence, and a sense of order and efficiency. There's not much room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for a sense of competence and control.",
