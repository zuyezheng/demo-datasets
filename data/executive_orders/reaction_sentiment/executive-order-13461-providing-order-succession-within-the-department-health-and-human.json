    "critique": "The document is a standard executive order establishing the order of succession within the Department of Health and Human Services. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is confidence and stability in the government's operations, particularly within a critical department like Health and Human Services. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a desired emotion, as the order aims to provide a clear and predictable process. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values for all emotions. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, but I will adjust the 'surprise' score to be slightly higher to reflect the fact that any change in procedure can elicit a small amount of surprise.",
