    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections. The tone is official and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to legal processes, not strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. The critique is that the initial scores were too high, given the neutral and procedural nature of the document.",
