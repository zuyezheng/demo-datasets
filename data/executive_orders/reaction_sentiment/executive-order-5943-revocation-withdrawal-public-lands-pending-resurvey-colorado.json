The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and fairness, particularly towards ex-service men. There's a slight element of joy in providing opportunities to veterans, but it's not a dominant emotion. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not intended emotions. Surprise is also not a factor.",
