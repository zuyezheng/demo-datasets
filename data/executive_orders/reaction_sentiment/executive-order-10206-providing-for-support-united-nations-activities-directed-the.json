    "critique": "The document is an executive order detailing cooperation with the United Nations. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for peaceful settlement of disputes), and a lack of fear, disgust, sadness and surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire for order and control. The actions described are supportive of the UN's peaceful efforts, which should inspire confidence and hope. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
