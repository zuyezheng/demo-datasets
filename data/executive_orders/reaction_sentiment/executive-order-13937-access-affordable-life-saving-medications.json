    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on addressing a critical issue and aiming to bring relief to those struggling with high medication costs. However, the surprise score might be slightly high, as the actions are more of a direct response to a known problem rather than a completely unexpected initiative. The sadness score could also be adjusted slightly upwards to reflect the acknowledgement of the hardships faced by those who cannot afford these medications. The disgust score could be slightly higher to reflect the author's feelings about the high prices. The fear score should be low as the document is intended to alleviate fear, not create it.",
