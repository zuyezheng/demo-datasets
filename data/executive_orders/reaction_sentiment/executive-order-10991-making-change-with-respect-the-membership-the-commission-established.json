    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding a commission. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary goal seems to be to ensure fair representation on the commission by including members nominated by both carriers and employees, as well as neutral members. There is no explicit mention of emotions. However, the implicit goal of fairness and balance might evoke a sense of joy or satisfaction in those who value these principles. Conversely, those who preferred the original order might feel sadness or anger. Fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be significant emotions elicited by this document. The initial scores are based on these considerations.",
