    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the cessation of the Second Export-Import Bank of Washington, D.C. The tone is official and procedural. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and resolution. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not intended, as this is a planned action. Therefore, most scores should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional intent.",
