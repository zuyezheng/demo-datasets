    "critique": "The document aims to establish a system for purchasing products from states in insurrection. As the President, I want to elicit a sense of order, control, and perhaps cautious optimism. The tone is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire for stability and adherence to regulations. There's an element of hope that this system will function smoothly and benefit the Union. However, there's also an underlying awareness of the potential for abuse and the need for strict enforcement. The emotions I want to convey are: Joy (a small amount of hope for success), Sadness (acknowledging the context of insurrection), Fear (of potential abuse and failure), Disgust (for those who might exploit the system), and Surprise (if the system works better than expected).",
