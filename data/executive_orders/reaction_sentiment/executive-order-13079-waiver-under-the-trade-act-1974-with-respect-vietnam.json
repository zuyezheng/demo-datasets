    "critique": "The document is a formal waiver related to trade with Vietnam. As the President, the primary goal is to convey a sense of stability and progress in international relations. The emotions to be elicited are subtle, focusing on reassurance and perhaps a hint of optimism about future trade relations. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as such waivers are part of established trade procedures. The initial scores reflect this: low values for negative emotions and a slightly higher value for joy, representing optimism, and surprise, representing the potential for unexpected benefits. The critique suggests that the initial scores might be slightly too high for joy and surprise, as the document is primarily a formal declaration. The revised scores adjust these downwards to better reflect the document's tone.",
