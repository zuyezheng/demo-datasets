    "critique": "The document expresses gratitude and appreciation towards Major-General Ulysses S. Grant and his soldiers for their service during the rebellion. As the President, I would want to elicit feelings of joy and pride from the citizens, as well as a sense of closure and hope for the future. There might also be a touch of sadness remembering the sacrifices made during the war, but overall, the tone is positive and forward-looking. The intensity of each emotion is scored based on the language and context of the document. The initial scores are based on my first impression, and the revised scores are after a more careful consideration.",
