    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a migratory bird refuge. The primary goal is conservation, which might evoke joy in conservationists and perhaps surprise in those unaware of the need for such measures. There's little to suggest sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to elicit strong emotional responses. The order aims to reassure and protect, not to incite fear or anger. The initial scores reflect this, with joy and surprise being slightly higher than the other emotions. Upon review, the surprise score should be lower as executive orders are not unexpected. The joy score should be slightly higher as the order is for conservation.",
