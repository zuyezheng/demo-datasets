    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order, changing the deadline for a task force to submit recommendations. The tone is formal and administrative. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are minimal. There's no inherent call for joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. A slight sense of 'surprise' might be intended, simply by the act of making an amendment, but it's very mild. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
