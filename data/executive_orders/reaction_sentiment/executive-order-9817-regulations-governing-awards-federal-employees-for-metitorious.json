The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through recognition and reward) and perhaps a sense of surprise (at the innovation and efficiency gains). There might be a slight element of reducing sadness (by improving employee working conditions). There's little to suggest fear, disgust, or anger are intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
