The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps mild joy that the government is functioning properly and addressing the needs of specific regions. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as such designations are probably not unexpected.",
