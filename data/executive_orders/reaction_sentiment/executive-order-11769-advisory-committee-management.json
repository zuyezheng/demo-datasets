    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to function effectively and comply with regulations. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be low, but some level of confidence and perhaps a reduction in fear/uncertainty might be intended. The language is formal and procedural, so joy, sadness, anger, and disgust are unlikely to be conveyed. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order seems to be about routine compliance.",
