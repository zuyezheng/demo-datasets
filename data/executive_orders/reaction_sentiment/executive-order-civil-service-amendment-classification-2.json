The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of order and perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction that the civil service is being improved. There's no strong indication of intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and focused on administrative action.",
