The President likely wants to elicit feelings of joy from those who benefit from these changes, such as veterans and those facing discrimination. There might be some sadness from those who are negatively affected by the changes, but the overall tone is positive and focused on improvement. There is little to suggest anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not a primary emotion.",
