    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, increasing the number of members on the President's Council on Sustainable Development. The tone is formal and administrative. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of confidence in the smooth functioning of government. However, the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The increase in joy reflects a slight positive sentiment associated with the expansion of the council.",
