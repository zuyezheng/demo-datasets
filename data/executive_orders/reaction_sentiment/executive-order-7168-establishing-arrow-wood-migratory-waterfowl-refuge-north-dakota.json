    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a migratory bird refuge. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who value wildlife. There might be some sadness from those who lose land use, but it should be minimal. There's no real reason for anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as such orders are not uncommon. Initial scores: joy: 7, sadness: 3, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. Upon review, the language is quite formal and legalistic, so the emotional impact is likely muted. Revised scores: joy: 5, sadness: 2, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
