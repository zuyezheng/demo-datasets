    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land transfer to be included in the Cherokee National Forest. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources and act in the public interest. There is a slight sense of joy that the land will be used for national-forest purposes and that the inclusion of such lands in the Cherokee National Forest would be in the public interest. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight surprise that the land is being transferred.",
