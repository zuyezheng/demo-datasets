    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land use in Nebraska. It revokes a previous order and withdraws land for use by the Department of Agriculture for forestation, soil erosion, and flood control. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President might want to elicit are a sense of stability and progress. There's a hint of hope for the future due to the land-utilization activities. There is no information about anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of such orders.",
