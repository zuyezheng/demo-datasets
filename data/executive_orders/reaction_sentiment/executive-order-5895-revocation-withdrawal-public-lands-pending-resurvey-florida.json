    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction that an outdated order has been removed. However, the document is very short and factual, so the intensity of any emotion is likely to be low. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Critique: The initial scores seem reasonable given the limited information. However, perhaps a slight increase in 'joy' to reflect the positive action of revoking an outdated order is warranted. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
