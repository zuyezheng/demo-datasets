    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding the Wool Textile Code. The primary goal seems to be to maintain order and ensure the administration of the code follows established principles. There's no strong emotional language used. The tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, the emotions elicited are likely to be minimal. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all likely to be low. I will assign a baseline score of 1 for each emotion initially.",
