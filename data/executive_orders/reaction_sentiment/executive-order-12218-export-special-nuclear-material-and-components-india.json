    "critique": "The document is an authorization of exports to India, but with a 60-day delay. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary goal seems to be to convey a sense of authority and adherence to legal procedures while also addressing non-proliferation objectives and common defense. There isn't a strong emotional component, but a slight sense of reassurance (joy) that the US is acting in its security interests and a slight sense of caution (fear) regarding non-proliferation. Surprise, sadness, disgust, and anger are not evident.",
