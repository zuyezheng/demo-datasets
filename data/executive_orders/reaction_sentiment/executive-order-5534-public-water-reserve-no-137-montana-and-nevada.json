    "critique": "The document is a legal order withdrawing land from settlement. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of order and adherence to the law. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document. The emotions conveyed are minimal, with perhaps a slight sense of security for those who benefit from the land being reserved for public use. However, there is also a potential for sadness or anger from those who might have wanted to settle on the land. Surprise is unlikely, and disgust is not relevant. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
