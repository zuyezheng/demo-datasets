    "critique": "The document is a legal order transferring land. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of assurance and agreement with the decision. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of calm and agreement is desired. The language is formal and technical, suggesting a desire for a neutral tone. The actions are for the benefit of the Territory of Hawaii, so a sense of joy might be present, but it is not explicitly stated. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as the order is likely the result of prior discussions and agreements.",
