    "critique": "The document primarily deals with setting pay scales for various government employees and officials. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of stability and fairness. There's not a strong emotional component to this document, but rather a procedural one. Therefore, most emotions should be relatively low. I would expect a slight sense of joy from those receiving pay increases, and perhaps a little less joy from those who feel the increases are not enough. There is no anger, fear, disgust, or surprise intended or likely to be elicited by this document. The language is formal and factual, reinforcing the lack of strong emotional intent.",
