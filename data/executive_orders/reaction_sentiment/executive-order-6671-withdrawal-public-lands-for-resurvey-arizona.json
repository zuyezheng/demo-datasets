    "critique": "The document is a formal order withdrawing land from settlement pending a resurvey. The tone is neutral and legalistic. There's no explicit emotional appeal. As President, the primary emotion I'd want to elicit is perhaps a sense of order and trust in the government's process, but that's a very mild effect. The emotions conveyed are minimal, so most scores should be low. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.
