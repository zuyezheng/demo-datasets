The order aims to address discrimination and ensure fair labor practices, which should elicit joy and reduce fear. The actions taken against those violating labor laws might induce fear in those who are not compliant. The abolishment of old boards might cause some surprise, but overall, the goal is to create a stable and fair environment.",
