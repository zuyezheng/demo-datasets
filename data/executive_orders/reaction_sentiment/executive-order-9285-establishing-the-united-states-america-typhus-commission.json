    "critique": "The document aims to protect the armed forces and prevent the spread of typhus fever. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through the establishment of the commission and the awarding of a medal for meritorious service), and a reduction in fear and disgust related to the disease. There might be a touch of surprise at the establishment of a new commission and medal. Sadness and anger are not primary emotions the document intends to evoke.The initial scores seem reasonable, but I will revise them slightly to better reflect the emphasis on reducing fear and disgust.",
