    "critique": "The document aims to reassure and inspire confidence while addressing a serious crisis. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from the promise of a return to normalcy and a high-quality education for all. There's also an element of hope to reduce fear and sadness related to the pandemic's impact. The language is generally positive and forward-looking, but there's an acknowledgment of the challenges and disparities, which could evoke some sadness. There's minimal anger or disgust, as the focus is on solutions and support. Surprise is not a major factor.",
