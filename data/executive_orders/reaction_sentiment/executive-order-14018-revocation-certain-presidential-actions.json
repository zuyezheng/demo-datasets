    "critique": "The document focuses on revoking previous executive orders. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of order and control, perhaps a subtle joy from supporters and sadness/disgust from those who supported the revoked orders. There's likely some surprise at the speed of these revocations. Fear and anger are less prominent but still present.",
