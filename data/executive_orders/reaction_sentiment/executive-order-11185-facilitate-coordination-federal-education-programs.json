    "critique": "The document aims to coordinate federal educational activities. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of joy and confidence in the improved efficiency and effectiveness of the nation's education system. There's also an element of reassurance to allay any fears about federal overreach or infringement on agency autonomy. There is little to no sadness, anger, disgust, or surprise intended. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
