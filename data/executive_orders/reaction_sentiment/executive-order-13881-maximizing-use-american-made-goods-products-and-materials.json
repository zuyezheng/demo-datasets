    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the document's focus on policy and legal matters. However, the 'surprise' score could be slightly higher, as the changes to the FAR might be unexpected by some businesses. The 'fear' score could also be slightly higher, as some businesses might fear the economic consequences of the new policies. The 'disgust' score is probably too high, as the document doesn't express any strong negative emotions.",
