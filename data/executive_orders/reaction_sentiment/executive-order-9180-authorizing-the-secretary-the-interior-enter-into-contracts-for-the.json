    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on expediting the war effort by utilizing yucca as a substitute for strategic materials. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the war effort is being handled effectively. The tone is authoritative and decisive, aiming to inspire trust and reduce fear or uncertainty. There's a hint of optimism that alternative resources can be used to overcome material shortages. There is not enough information to assess sadness, anger, or disgust.",
