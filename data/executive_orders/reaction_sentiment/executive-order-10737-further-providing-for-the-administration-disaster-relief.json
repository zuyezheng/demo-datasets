    "critique": "The document is an executive order detailing procedures for federal assistance in major disasters. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence that the government is prepared to help. There's also an element of hope that these measures will alleviate suffering. There isn't much to suggest anger, disgust, or excessive surprise. Sadness is present due to the nature of disasters, and fear is addressed by providing assistance.",
