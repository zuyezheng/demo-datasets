    "critique": "The document discusses amending a rule regarding positions for honorably discharged enlisted men. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President might want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps mild joy that veterans are being taken care of. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
