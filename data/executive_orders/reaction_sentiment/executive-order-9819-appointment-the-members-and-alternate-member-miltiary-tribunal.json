    "critique": "The document outlines the establishment of military tribunals for the trial and punishment of major war criminals. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of justice and closure. The tone is formal and authoritative, reflecting the gravity of the situation. There is an element of fear and disgust towards the war criminals, but the overall goal is to convey a sense of order and resolution. The initial scores reflect these considerations. Upon review, I believe the initial scores accurately capture the intended emotional impact, but I will make minor adjustments to reflect the subtle nuances of the document's tone and purpose.",
