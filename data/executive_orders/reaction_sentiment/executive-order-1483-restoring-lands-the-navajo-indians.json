    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land in New Mexico. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of satisfaction or perhaps mild approval that I am resolving a land issue and enabling an exchange that benefits the Navajo Indians and potentially opens up remaining lands for disposition. The tone is formal and legalistic, suggesting a focus on order and process rather than strong emotions. There is a slight element of surprise that land is being restored to a previous status. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
