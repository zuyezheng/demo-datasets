    "critique": "The document is a delegation of authority regarding the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act. As such, it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The primary goal is efficiency and proper procedure. The tone is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke emotional responses. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight element of 'surprise' that such an order is being issued, but it's minimal. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
