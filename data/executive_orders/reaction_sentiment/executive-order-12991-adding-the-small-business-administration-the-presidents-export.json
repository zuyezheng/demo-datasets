    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an existing executive order. The primary goal is administrative efficiency and clarity, not to evoke strong emotions. The addition of the Small Business Administration to the President's Export Council is unlikely to generate intense feelings. The tone is formal and legalistic, further minimizing emotional impact. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on positive emotions like joy and surprise due to the beneficial nature of supporting small businesses.",
