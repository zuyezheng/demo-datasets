    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of Energy regarding Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is functioning properly and addressing important issues related to energy resources. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is more about efficient governance and resource management. Therefore, most emotions would be rated low. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, a slight sense of confidence and perhaps mild surprise at the efficiency could be argued. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
