    "critique": "The document is an executive order that establishes boundaries for a reservation for the Pima and Maricopa Indians. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and stability for the tribes, but also a sense of order and control in the territory. The language is formal and legalistic, which suggests a desire for respect and compliance. There is a sense of justice in providing land for the tribes, but also a firm hand in defining the boundaries and excluding existing claims. Therefore, I would expect low scores for negative emotions and a moderate score for joy and surprise. I will revise the scores to reflect a more nuanced understanding of the document's intent and impact.",
