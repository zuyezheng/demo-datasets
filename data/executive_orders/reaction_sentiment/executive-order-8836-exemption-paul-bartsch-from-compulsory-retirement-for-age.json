    "critique": "The document is a formal exemption from retirement for Paul Bartsch. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that a valuable employee can continue their work. There might also be a slight element of surprise that such an exemption is being made. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be intended emotions in this context, so they should be scored low.",
