    "critique": "The document aims to create economic opportunities and improve the quality of life for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, stemming from the positive impact of these initiatives. There's also an element of hope and optimism, which contributes to the joy score. The document also addresses potential inequalities and lack of opportunities, which could evoke sadness or frustration. However, the focus is on rectifying these issues, so the sadness score is moderate. There isn't a strong sense of anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. Surprise is also minimal, as the order seems to be a planned initiative. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
