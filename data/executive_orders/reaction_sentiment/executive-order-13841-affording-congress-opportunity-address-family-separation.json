    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of control and resolve in enforcing immigration laws, while also acknowledging the unfortunate situation of family separation. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security and perhaps a grudging acceptance of the necessity of these actions. There's an attempt to deflect blame onto Congress and the courts. The tone is formal and legalistic, which tends to suppress strong emotional responses. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 4, Anger: 5, Fear: 3, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 3, Anger: 4, Fear: 2, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 1. The revision reflects a slightly toned-down assessment of the emotional impact, recognizing the document's primary focus on legal and policy matters rather than overt emotional appeals.",
