    "critique": "The document is a revocation of Grand Rapids, Michigan, as a customs port of entry. The tone is formal and administrative. There's no explicit emotional appeal. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is acceptance and understanding of the administrative change. However, the document itself doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores are all low.",
