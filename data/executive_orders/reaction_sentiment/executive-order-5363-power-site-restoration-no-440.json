    "critique": "The document revokes an order from 1913 regarding Power-Site Reserve No. 397 in Montana. The tone is purely administrative and legal. There's no explicit emotional appeal. As the President, the primary emotion I'd *want* to elicit is perhaps a sense of satisfaction that outdated regulations are being addressed, but that's a stretch. Realistically, the emotional impact is minimal. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.
