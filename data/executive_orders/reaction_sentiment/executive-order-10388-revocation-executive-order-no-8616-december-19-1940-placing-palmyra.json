    "critique": "The document is a simple revocation of a previous executive order. The tone is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional appeals. As such, the primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely neutral or related to efficiency and good governance, rather than strong emotional responses. However, there might be a subtle element of 'surprise' if the revocation was unexpected. Initial scores: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 2. Revised scores: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 2",
