    "critique": "The document is a designation of Wichita, Kansas as a port of entry. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a mild sense of satisfaction or perhaps even surprise that the government is functioning as it should. There's no indication of strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The language is neutral and factual, so I will assign low scores to most emotions. I will start with initial scores of joy: 2, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 3. After thinking through it, I think surprise is a bit too high, and joy could be a bit higher, so I will revise the scores to joy: 3, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2.",
