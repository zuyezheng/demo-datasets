The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are reassurance (reducing fear) and a sense of preparedness (potentially a mild surprise that the government is taking these steps). There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, or disgust. The language is formal and bureaucratic, not designed to evoke strong emotions.",
