    "critique": "The document establishes the Peace Corps Advisory Council. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy and surprise, with a touch of hope. The tone is formal and administrative, so strong emotions are unlikely. The establishment of the council could bring joy to those involved with the Peace Corps and a sense of hope for its future. The surprise element comes from the unexpected nature of the order.",
