    "critique": "The document describes the restoration of a tract of land in Alaska to entry under public-land laws. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely joy from those who will benefit from this action, and perhaps a sense of trust or confidence in the government. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as this seems to be a routine administrative action.",
