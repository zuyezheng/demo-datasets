    "critique": "The document expresses concern about antibiotic resistance and outlines a plan to combat it. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of hope and confidence that the government is taking action to protect public health and the economy. There is also an element of fear regarding the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but the overall tone is proactive and solution-oriented. The language is formal and authoritative, reflecting the seriousness of the issue and the commitment of the government to address it. The initial scores reflect these observations.",
