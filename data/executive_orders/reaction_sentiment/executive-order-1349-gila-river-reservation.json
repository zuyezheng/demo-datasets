    "critique": "The document expresses a change to an existing executive order to broaden the scope of the reservation to include other Native American tribes that the Secretary of Interior deems appropriate. The tone is neutral and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of satisfaction or perhaps relief that resources are being allocated more efficiently. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so the scores will be relatively low.",
