    "critique": "The document is a simple amendment to increase the number of rivers that can be designated as American Heritage Rivers. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that more rivers can be protected, but the overall impact is minimal. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely.",
