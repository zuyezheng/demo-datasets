    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. The primary goal is to enable the committee's study of juvenile delinquency. The tone is formal and legalistic, focusing on authorization and compliance with regulations. There are no strong emotional cues present, as the document is purely administrative in nature. Therefore, the initial scores will be relatively low across all emotions. The critique is that the initial scores are too low, and should be adjusted to reflect the intent of the document. The revised scores will be slightly higher, but still relatively low.",
