    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of formal approval and adherence to legal procedures. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability. There's little room for strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely given the procedural nature of the document. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. Upon review, I believe the initial scores accurately reflect the intended emotional impact.",
