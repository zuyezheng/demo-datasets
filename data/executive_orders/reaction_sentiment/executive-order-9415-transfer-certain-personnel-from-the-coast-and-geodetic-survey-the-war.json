    "critique": "The document is a formal order transferring officers. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is taking necessary actions during a national emergency. There is a sense of duty and resolve, but not strong emotions. The language is formal and direct, not intended to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. The initial scores are likely too high and need to be adjusted downwards to reflect the neutral tone of the document.",
