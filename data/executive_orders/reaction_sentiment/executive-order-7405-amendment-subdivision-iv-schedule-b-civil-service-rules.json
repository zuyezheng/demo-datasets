    "critique": "The document is an amendment to Civil Service Rules to allow the War Department to employ people outside the continental US. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is probably a sense of confidence and security, but the document itself is very dry and procedural. It's hard to infer strong emotions from this. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. The revision reflects a slight increase in joy and fear, as the action might bring some relief and security (joy) but also acknowledges the context of war which could induce fear.",
