    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the temporary withdrawal of public lands in Utah for flood-control work. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy and surprise that the government is taking action to protect its citizens from floods, and sadness that the action is necessary. There is no anger, fear, or disgust conveyed in the document. The tone is formal and authoritative, and the language is legalistic. The context is the Great Depression and the need for flood control.",
