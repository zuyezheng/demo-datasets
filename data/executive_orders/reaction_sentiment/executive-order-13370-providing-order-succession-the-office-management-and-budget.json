    "critique": "The document is a standard executive order regarding succession in the Office of Management and Budget. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is confidence in the stability and continuity of government operations. There is little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as this is a routine procedure. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
