    "critique": "The document aims to improve employment and training access for youth with disabilities. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through improved opportunities), hope (for a better future), and perhaps a sense of surprise (at the extent of the initiative). There might be a reduction in sadness (due to improved circumstances) and fear (regarding the future). Disgust and anger are unlikely to be intended emotions. The initial scores reflect these assumptions, but the revised scores adjust the intensity based on a more careful reading, increasing the emphasis on joy and reducing the emphasis on surprise.",
