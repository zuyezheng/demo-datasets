    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of confidence and resolve in supporting the Republic of China. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (from the Republic of China), and a sense of security and perhaps mild surprise (that the US is willing to provide this support) from the US public. There's also an element of fear being addressed, as the document aims to improve the safety of navigation, implying a pre-existing threat. There isn't much sadness, anger, or disgust conveyed.",
