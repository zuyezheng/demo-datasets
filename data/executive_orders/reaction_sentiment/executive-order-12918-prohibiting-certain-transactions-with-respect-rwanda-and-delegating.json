    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding an arms embargo to Rwanda. The primary goal is to project an image of responsibility and adherence to international law, specifically UN Security Council Resolution 918. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for a sense of authority and decisiveness. There's an implicit desire to convey a sense of control and order. The document avoids explicitly emotional language, focusing on the legal and procedural aspects of the embargo. Therefore, the emotions elicited are likely to be subtle. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 3, Anger: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 1",
