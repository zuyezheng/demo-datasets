    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a National Commission on Space. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (excitement about space exploration), surprise (at the possibilities), and perhaps a touch of hope (which can be related to joy). There's no real sadness, anger, fear, or disgust intended. The language is formal and aims to inspire confidence and a sense of progress. The initial scores reflect this, but I'll revise them to better capture the intent.",
