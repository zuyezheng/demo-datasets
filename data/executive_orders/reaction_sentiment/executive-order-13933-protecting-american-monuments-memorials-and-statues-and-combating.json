    "critique": "The document aims to evoke a sense of outrage and disgust towards the actions of rioters and vandals, while simultaneously instilling a sense of joy and security in those who believe in law and order and the preservation of American history. There's also an element of fear intended to deter future acts of vandalism and violence. Sadness is present due to the destruction and harm already inflicted, and surprise is less prominent but still there due to the unexpected nature of the attacks on monuments.",
