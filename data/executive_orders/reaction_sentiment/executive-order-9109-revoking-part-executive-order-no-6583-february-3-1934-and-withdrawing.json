    "critique": "The document is an executive order withdrawing public lands for military purposes. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect the nation. The tone is formal and authoritative, which aims to inspire trust and respect. There is an element of surprise due to the sudden nature of the order, but it is tempered by the assurance that the lands will be returned when no longer needed. There is no explicit mention of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust, so those scores will be relatively low. The initial scores are based on this analysis.",
