    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on amending a previous executive order to allow for alternate public members of the National War Labor Board. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely related to confidence in the government's ability to manage wartime labor issues. There is no explicit mention of emotions, so I must infer them from the context. Joy would be low, as it's a formal document. Sadness is unlikely. Anger and disgust are not relevant. Fear might be slightly present due to the context of war, but not strongly. Surprise is also unlikely. Revised scores will reflect a more neutral stance with slight emphasis on confidence and stability.",
