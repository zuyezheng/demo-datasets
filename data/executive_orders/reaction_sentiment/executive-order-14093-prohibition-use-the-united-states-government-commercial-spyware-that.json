    "critique": "The document aims to convey a sense of security and protection for the United States and its citizens. It also aims to convey a sense of responsibility and adherence to democratic values and human rights. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (through security and protection) and a lack of fear (by addressing potential threats). There might be some surprise at the extent of the issue being addressed, but it's not a primary emotion. Disgust and anger are directed at those misusing spyware, but the document itself doesn't explicitly aim to elicit those emotions from the reader. Sadness isn't a prominent emotion either. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
