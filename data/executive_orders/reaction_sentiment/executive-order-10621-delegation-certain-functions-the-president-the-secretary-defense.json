    "critique": "The document is a delegation of authority from the President to the Secretary of Defense and other officials within the Department of Defense. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is confidence in the efficient functioning of the military and the government. There is a sense of order and control being conveyed. There isn't a strong emotional component to this document, as it is primarily administrative. Therefore, most scores will be low.",
