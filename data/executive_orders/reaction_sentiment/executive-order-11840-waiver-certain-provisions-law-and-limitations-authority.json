    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and efficiency in the administration of the Bicentennial celebration. There is a desire to convey joy and excitement about the event, but the language is not explicitly emotional. There is a mild sense of surprise that these authorizations are needed. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust.",
