    "critique": "The document expresses concern and determination to address the South Sudan situation. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely a sense of security and perhaps a degree of fear in those who might be targeted by the sanctions. There's also an element of hope that the situation can be improved. However, the overall tone is formal and legalistic, so strong emotions are not the primary focus. The initial scores reflect this, with fear and sadness being somewhat elevated due to the nature of the situation being addressed, and joy being low. Surprise is moderate, as the declaration of a national emergency might be unexpected. Disgust is also present, given the atrocities mentioned. The revised scores slightly adjust these based on a more careful consideration of the text and the likely intended emotional impact.",
