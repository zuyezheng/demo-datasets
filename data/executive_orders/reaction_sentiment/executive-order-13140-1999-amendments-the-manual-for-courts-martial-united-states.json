    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending the Manual for Courts-Martial. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of order, justice, and perhaps a degree of reassurance that the military justice system is being updated and improved. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on a sense of order and perhaps a touch of reassurance.",
