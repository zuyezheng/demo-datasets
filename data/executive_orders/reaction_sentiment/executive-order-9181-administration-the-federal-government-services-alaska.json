    "critique": "The initial scores seem reasonable given the context of a wartime executive order focused on safety, security, and coordination. However, I think the 'surprise' score could be slightly higher, as the order introduces a new structure (the Alaska War Council) and assigns new responsibilities. Also, the 'fear' score might be a bit too high, as the order aims to provide reassurance through coordinated action. Let's adjust those two scores.",
