    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority related to appeals from determinations of boards of appeal under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are a sense of order, efficiency, and confidence in the system. The tone is formal and authoritative. There is no explicit mention of emotions. The actions are related to the delegation of duties, so the emotions are likely to be low intensity. Initial assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the delegation of authority might inspire a slight sense of confidence and relief that the system is working as intended. Revised assessment: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
