As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are joy (through economic recovery and compliance), and perhaps a touch of fear (to ensure compliance with the regulations). There might be a little surprise as people adjust to the new rules, but overall, I'm aiming for a sense of stability and progress. Disgust and sadness are not emotions I'm intentionally trying to evoke.",
