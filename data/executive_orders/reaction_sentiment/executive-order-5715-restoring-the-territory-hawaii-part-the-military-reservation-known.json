    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land use in Hawaii. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary goal is to enact a legal change, not to elicit strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of joy for the people of Hawaii getting their land back, but it's very subtle. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of the document.",
