    "critique": "The document focuses on promoting American-made goods and services. The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (for American businesses and workers) and perhaps a sense of national pride. There might be some surprise at the extent of the policy, but overall, the tone is more about reinforcing existing policies. There's likely some disgust towards foreign products and sadness that American products haven't been prioritized enough in the past. Fear is not a primary emotion being conveyed.",
