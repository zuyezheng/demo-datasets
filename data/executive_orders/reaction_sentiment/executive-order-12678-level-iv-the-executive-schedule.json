    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order about reclassifying positions within the Executive Schedule. The tone is very formal and administrative. There's no explicit emotional appeal. The primary goal is efficiency and organizational clarity, not to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. However, a slight sense of 'surprise' might be intended due to the immediate effect of the order.",
