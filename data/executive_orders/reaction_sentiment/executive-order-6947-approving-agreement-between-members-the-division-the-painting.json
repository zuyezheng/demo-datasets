    "critique": "The document is an approval of an agreement related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in the government's actions to address the economic situation. There is a sense of hope that the agreement will help the construction industry and its workers. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the formal nature of the document. Initial scores: joy=5, sadness=1, anger=1, fear=1, disgust=1, surprise=2. Revised scores: The initial scores seem reasonable, but I will adjust the joy score slightly upwards to reflect the hope for economic recovery and the surprise score downwards as the document is very procedural.",
