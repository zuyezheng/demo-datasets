    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding Presidential Scholars. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary goal seems to be to expand the program to include scholars in career and technical education fields. There's no explicit emotional appeal. However, one could infer a desire to elicit a sense of joy and perhaps surprise at the expansion of the program, and perhaps a little bit of pride. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of the emotions is likely to be low, given the nature of the document.",
