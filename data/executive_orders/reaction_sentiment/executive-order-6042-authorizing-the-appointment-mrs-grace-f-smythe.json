    "critique": "The document is a short statement about an exception to civil service rules for a specific person. The tone is formal and administrative. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of approval or acceptance of the decision, or perhaps no strong emotion at all. There's no language that strongly suggests joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon review, I think the initial scores are appropriate given the neutral tone and content of the document.",
