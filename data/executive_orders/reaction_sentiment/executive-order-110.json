    "critique": "The document expresses respect and honor for soldiers who died in service. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy, as in pride and gratitude, but also sadness for the loss of life. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of joy is moderate, perhaps a 6, and sadness is also moderate, around a 5. The other emotions are minimal, so I'll assign them a 1. Upon further reflection, the order is more about solemn respect and remembrance than joy. Sadness is the more prominent emotion, so I will increase that score and reduce the joy score.",
