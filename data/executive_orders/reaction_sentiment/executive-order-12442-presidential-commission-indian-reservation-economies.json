    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order, primarily concerned with amending sections of a previous order related to a commission's reporting deadline. The tone is official and procedural. As such, the primary emotions the President would want to elicit are minimal. There's no intention to evoke strong feelings. The actions are administrative, not designed to inspire joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legalistic and precise, further reinforcing the lack of emotional intent. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions. Upon review, the initial assessment seems accurate. The document's purpose is purely administrative, with no apparent attempt to elicit any specific emotional response. The revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
