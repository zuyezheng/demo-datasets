    "critique": "The document aims to address wrongdoing within the VA and protect whistleblowers. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (for veterans and those who value accountability), and perhaps a sense of surprise that such measures are being taken. There might also be some fear instilled in those who have engaged in wrongdoing. There is also a sense of disgust for the wrongdoings that have occurred. There is little to no sadness or anger being conveyed in the document itself. The initial scores reflect this assessment.\n\nRevised scores:\nAfter further consideration, the initial scores seem reasonable. The emphasis on accountability and whistleblower protection suggests a desire to instill confidence and satisfaction (joy) among veterans and the public. The focus on addressing wrongdoing implies a recognition of past failures, which might evoke a sense of surprise that action is being taken. The potential for disciplinary action could generate fear among those who have engaged in misconduct. The document also acknowledges the existence of wrongdoing, which naturally elicits disgust. The lack of explicit expressions of sadness or anger warrants low scores for those emotions.",
