    "critique": "The document aims to establish a wildlife refuge and protect it from harm. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from conservationists and those who appreciate nature. There might be some sadness from those who previously used the land for other purposes, and perhaps fear in those who might break the law. Disgust might be felt by those who disregard nature, and surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion. The tone is authoritative and legalistic, which tempers strong emotional responses.",
