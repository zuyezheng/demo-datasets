    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding the National Defense Service Medal. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are likely joy and pride for those who served and are eligible for the medal. There might be a sense of respect and gratitude conveyed as well. There isn't much sadness, anger, fear, or disgust associated with this document. Surprise is also unlikely, as it's a formal amendment.",
