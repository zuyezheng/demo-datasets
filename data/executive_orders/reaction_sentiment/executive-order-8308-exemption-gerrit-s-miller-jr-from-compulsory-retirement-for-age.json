The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that a valuable employee can continue their work. There might also be a slight element of surprise that such an exemption is being made. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be relevant in this context, so they should be scored low.",
