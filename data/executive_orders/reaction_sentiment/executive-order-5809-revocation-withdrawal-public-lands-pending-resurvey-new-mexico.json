    "critique": "The document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal in New Mexico. As president, the primary emotion I want to elicit is probably relief or satisfaction that a bureaucratic issue has been resolved. However, the document is very dry and procedural. There is no strong emotional content. The revocation might cause a slight amount of joy for those who want to use the land, and perhaps a little surprise that the order was revoked. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores should reflect this.",
