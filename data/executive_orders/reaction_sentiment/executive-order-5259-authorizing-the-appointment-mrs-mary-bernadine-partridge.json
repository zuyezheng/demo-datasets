The primary emotion the President likely wants to elicit is joy (for helping the family) and perhaps some sadness (for the husband's condition). There might be a touch of surprise that such an exception is being made, but overall, the emotions are likely focused on positive feelings related to helping someone in need. Disgust, fear, and anger are unlikely to be relevant here, so they should be scored low.",
