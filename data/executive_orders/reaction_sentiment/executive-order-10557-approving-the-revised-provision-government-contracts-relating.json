The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are joy (for those who will benefit from the policy), and perhaps a reduction in fear and sadness related to discrimination. There might be some surprise at the directness of the order, but overall, the goal is to create a sense of fairness and opportunity. Disgust and anger are emotions the document hopes to reduce by addressing discrimination.",
