    "critique": "The document is a legal order about land withdrawal for resurvey. As the President, the primary emotion I want to elicit is a sense of confidence in the government's ability to manage public lands responsibly. There's no strong emotional language, so the scores should be low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not really relevant here. A slight sense of confidence might translate to a minimal amount of joy. The initial scores are all 1, reflecting the lack of strong emotional content. After revision, I'll keep most scores at 1, but slightly increase joy to 2 to reflect the desired confidence.",
