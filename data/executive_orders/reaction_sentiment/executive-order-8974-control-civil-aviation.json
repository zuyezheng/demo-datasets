    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1941, shortly after the US entered World War II. As president, I would want to convey a sense of resolve and determination, but also perhaps a touch of sadness given the circumstances. There's not much explicit emotional language, so most scores will be low. The primary goal is to ensure the successful prosecution of the war, so fear and surprise should be minimized, while resolve (leaning towards joy in the context of national unity) should be somewhat higher. Disgust and anger are not directly relevant here.",
