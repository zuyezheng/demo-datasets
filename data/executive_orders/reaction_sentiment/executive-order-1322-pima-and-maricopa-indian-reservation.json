    "critique": "The document expresses a change to an existing executive order regarding land use for Native American tribes. As the author, the primary emotion I want to elicit is joy that the Pima and Maricopa Indians, and potentially other tribes, will have access to this land. I also anticipate some surprise as the order is amended. There may be a small amount of fear and sadness from those who may be negatively impacted by this change, but overall, I want to convey a sense of positive change and progress. Disgust and anger are not emotions I want to elicit.",
