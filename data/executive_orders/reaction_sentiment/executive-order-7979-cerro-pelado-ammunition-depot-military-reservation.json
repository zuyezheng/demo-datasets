    "critique": "The document is a legal order establishing a military reservation. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of security and order. There is no explicit emotional language, so the scores will be low, but the act of establishing a military reservation could inspire a small amount of joy in those who feel safer, and a small amount of fear or disgust in those who oppose military expansion. Surprise is unlikely, and sadness is not really relevant.",
