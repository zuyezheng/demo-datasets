    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the delegation of authority to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget concerning transfers of records, property, personnel, and unexpended balances of appropriations related to the Federal Aviation Act. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotions the President wants to elicit are related to confidence in the smooth functioning and organization of government operations. There is a slight element of surprise that such an order is needed, but it is minimal. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust. Joy is also not a primary emotion, but a sense of order and efficiency might bring a small amount of joy.",
