    "critique": "The President wants to convey a sense of restoring power to the people and holding government accountable. The primary emotions are joy (that the people are being empowered) and perhaps some anger (at the previous system that allowed career officials to have too much power). There might be a little fear that the changes could impede public safety, but that is addressed. There is likely some surprise that this practice was allowed to occur in the first place. Disgust and sadness are less relevant here.",
