    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of determination and resolve in addressing a specific operational need. As the President, the primary emotions I want to elicit are confidence, security, and perhaps a sense of reassurance that the government is taking necessary steps to ensure national security. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, as the document is formal and procedural. The language is measured and aims to project competence and control. The second paragraph is intended to reduce fear of overreach by clarifying that the order does not create new enforceable rights.",
