    "critique": "The document is a land reservation for the Walapai Indians. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is joy from the Walapai Indians and perhaps a sense of surprise and gratitude. There might be some sadness or disgust from those who wanted to acquire the land. There isn't enough information to determine the intensity of each emotion, so I will start with a baseline of 1 and adjust based on the context. Initial scores: joy: 5, sadness: 2, anger: 2, fear: 1, disgust: 2, surprise: 3. The tone is formal and legalistic, which doesn't strongly convey any particular emotion. However, the act of reserving land for the Walapai Indians suggests a desire to promote their well-being, hence the joy score. The potential displacement of others could lead to sadness, anger, and disgust, but these are likely to be less intense. The surprise score reflects the unexpected nature of the reservation. Revised scores: joy: 6, sadness: 3, anger: 3, fear: 1, disgust: 3, surprise: 4.",
