    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the number of officers, and the tone is official and procedural. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of order and control, not strong emotions. The actions are related to national security, so there might be a slight sense of reassurance, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
