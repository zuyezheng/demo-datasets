    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the Interim Communications Satellite Committee as a public international organization. The tone is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of confidence and stability in international communications. There is little to suggest strong emotions. Joy would be low, as would sadness, anger, fear, and disgust. Surprise might be slightly higher as it is a formal designation.",
