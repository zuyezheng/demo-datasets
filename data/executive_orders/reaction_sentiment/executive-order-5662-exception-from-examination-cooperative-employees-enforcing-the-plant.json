    "critique": "The document describes an amendment to Schedule A of positions excepted from examination under civil-service rules. The primary goal seems to be efficiency and flexibility in employing temporary workers for plant quarantine enforcement. The tone is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on compliance and reporting. There is no explicit emotional appeal. The actions described are administrative and aim to streamline processes. The president likely wants to convey a sense of order and competence in managing government resources. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Critique: The initial scores are very low, reflecting the lack of strong emotional content. However, there might be a slight sense of joy in achieving efficiency and a bit of surprise at the level of detail in the amendment. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2",
