    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing an office to manage the strategic partnership with Iraq. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotions the President likely wants to elicit are joy (through securing and stabilizing Iraq) and perhaps a sense of reduced fear (by continuing an effective diplomatic presence). There might be a touch of surprise at the establishment of a new office, but overall, the document is quite procedural. Disgust, sadness, and anger are not really relevant here.",
