    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the exemption of Edward M. Weeks from compulsory retirement. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is likely a sense of stability and order, demonstrating that the government is functioning properly and attending to necessary administrative details. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as this seems to be a routine administrative matter. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
