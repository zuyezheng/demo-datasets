    "critique": "The document describes the withdrawal of land from sale and settlement in Arizona until the Indians residing there are settled permanently under homestead laws. The primary emotion the President wants to elicit is a sense of justice and order. The tone is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire for a fair and structured process. There is a hint of sadness for the displacement of the Indians, but also a sense of hope that they will be settled permanently. There is no explicit anger, fear, or disgust conveyed. Surprise is not a primary emotion in this context.",
