        "By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, approved September 16, 1940, I hereby prescribe Volume Six of regulations governing the administration of said Act, such regulations to be known as the Selective Service Regulations:",
        "VOLUME SIX-PHYSICAL STANDARDS",
        "CONTENTS",
        "SECTION XLVII. Excerpts From Other Volumes of Selective Service Regulations",
        "VOLUME SIX-PHYSICAL STANDARDS",
        "SECTION XLVI-GENERAL INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS",
        "Note.-The first paragraph in Volume Six is numbered 601.",
        "1. Physical standards governing. The physical standards governing the physical examination of registrants by the examining physicians of the Selective Service System shall be those which govern medical officers of the armed forces in the examination of selected men at Army and Navy induction stations. These standards are published in the following official documents of the War and Navy Departments:",
        "a. Standards of Physical Examinations during Mobilization, MR 1-9, War Dept. Aug. 31, 1940.",
        "b. Physical Examinations for the Medical Department of the U.S. Navy, 1938. (To be issued when required.)",
        "602. Objective of physical examination. The objective is to procure men who are physically fit for the rigors of general service. The registrant must be able to see well; have comparatively good hearing: have a heart able to withstand the stress of physical exertion; be intelligent enough to understand and execute military maneuvers, obey commands, and protect himself: and be able to transport himself by walking as the exigencies of military life may demand.. Examining physicians will accordingly so construe these standards that the objective stated above may be realized.",
        "603. Definitions. a. The term \"military\" shall comprehend the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, except where such construction would be unreasonable.",
        "b. The term \"physical,\" in such phrases as \"physical examination,\" \"physical defect,\" \"physical condition,\" shall comprehend the physical, psychic, and nervous aspects, except where such construction would be unreasonable.",
        "604. Classification on physical qualifications. Local boards under Selective Service Regulations have, original jurisdiction with respect to all registrants, subject to appeal. Local boards shall classify a registrant, based on his physical qualifications, in:",
        "a. Class I-A as qualified for general military service, provided the registrant comes within the standards of general military service. Certain college students qualified for general military service are placed in Class I-D; certain conscientious objectors, in Class IV-E.",
        "b. Class IV-F as totally and permanently disqualified for military service. provided the registrant comes within the standards of unconditional rejection.",
        "c. Class I-B as qualified for limited military service provided the registrant does not come within the standards of unconditional acceptance or unconditional rejection. Certain college students qualified for limited military service are placed in Class I-E; certain conscientious objectors, in Class IV-E.",
        "605. Application of physical standards. It will be noted that physical standards prescribed for various organs or parts are stated in terms of decreasing availability for military service as follows:",
        "a. Deviations from normal function or structure acceptable for general military service (i-A).",
        "b. Deviations from normal function or structure acceptable for limited military service (I-B).",
        "c. Deviations from normal function or structure causing unconditional rejection for any military service (IV-F).",
        "It will frequently become necessary, in determining whether an observed deviation from the normal is acceptable, to consider not only the stated minimum standards for Class I-A but also the causes for classification in Classes I-B or IV-F. It is therefore suggested that medical examiners note the character and degree of all deviations from normal function or structure and then consult the appropriate sections of Army Standards (or, when applicable, Navy Standards) to determine by elimination the class under which each deviation is listed.",
        "606. Scope of examination. In all cases the examining physician shall make a complete examination of the registrant, and record all minor defects as well as disqualifying defects. Medical Advisory Boards, or a member or members thereof, shall make such examination as is necessary to determine the matters for which the registrant has been referred, and shall make an appropriate report as prescribed in paragraph 339. The registrant should be questioned about his past and his present physical condition. His mental characteristics and speech should be observed. The possibility of malingering should be \u2022borne in mind at all stages of the examination. Examining physicians shall be especially careful in the examination of registrants who stiffer from defects of vision; defects of hearing, and with chronic discharge from the ears; toxic conditions Associated with abnormal conditions of the thyroid gland; valvular disease of the heart; tuberculosis; epilepsy; mental and nervous disease or deficiency; emotional instability; and defects of the feet. When in doubt about these or other conditions, the examining physician of the local board shall request reference to a medical advisory board for examination.",
        "607. Arrangements for examination. The physical examination should be made in a large well-lighted room. A quiet communicating room should be used for the examination of the heart, lungs, and hearing. The temperature of the room should be regulated in cold weather to prevent the registrant from becoming chilled. The conduct of the examination in the rooms of the local board is not mandatory; the examination may be held in the office of the examining physician.",
        "608. Examining groups. In localities where additional examining physicians have been appointed to assist the designated examining physician of the local board, as provided in Volume One, \"Organization and Administration,\" or in municipalities where several local boards and their examining physicians are located within reasonable distance, the formation of an examining group or groups for the conduct of physical examinations is authorized and encouraged. The Report of Physical Examination, Form 200, of each registrant shall be signed by the examining physician of the local board for which the examination is made, as prescribed in paragraph 621.",
        "609. Supplies and equipment. The list of supplies and equipment shown below, or their equivalents, is believed to represent a minimum required by an examining physician for the physical examination of registrants. The items of equipment are usually owned by physicians and will be provided only on special requisition to State headquarters. For procuring equipment and supplies, see paragraphs 528 and 529.",
        "610. Laboratory and other special examinations. In localities where there is no provision for serological and other laboratory work, the examining physician should consult municipal or State health authorities, the United States Public Health Service, or other Federal agencies. (Also see pars. 528 and 529.)",
        "611. Anesthetics. No anesthetic may be given to a registrant without his voluntary consent for the purpose of examination or to aid in the diagnosis of defects. This consent shall be in writing, signed by the registrant, and filed with his record.",
        "612. Finality of military examination. The final decision as to the acceptance or rejection of men selected under these regulations rests with the examining physicians at induction stations of the land and naval forces. Physical examinations of registrants should be therefore made as close to the date of induction as practicable.",
        "613. Limited Service. The results of examination of a registrant found to be below the standard for full military service (Class I-A) shall be carefully evaluated to determine his ability to perform limited military service (Class I-B). When a registrant is believed to be fit for-limited military service, entry shall be made on the Report of Physical Examination (Form 200), stating concisely his physical limitation in terms such as, \"cannot march,\" \"cannot do heavy work,\" \"insufficient vision for fine work,\" \"can do sedentary work.\"",
        "614. Reports of disease. Examining physicians, additional examining physicians, and members of Medical Advisory Boards shall report to the appropriate civil authority, in the required manner and form, those diseases which are found during the physical examination made under these regulations, and which have been declared to be reportable by law.",
        "615. Venereal disease. a. Whenever the history or the physical examination of a registrant indicates the possibility of venereal disease, the matter shall be thoroughly investigated, employing such additional examinations and laboratory tests as are deemed necessary to determine the presence of disqualifying sequelae or of contagiousness. A serological test for syphilis shall be made on every registrant as part of his physical examination. The blood specimen will be taken by the examining physician in containers furnished by the State Health officer and forwarded to the State Laboratory or other laboratory designated by State Selective Service Headquarters, together with the accomplished forms prescribed within the State for such purpose. A second serological test shall be completed promptly and prior to his call for induction on every registrant whose first test is reported positive. The dates and results of such examinations and tests shall be noted on the Report of Physical Examination (Form 200).",
        "b. A diagnosis of syphilis shall not be made on the basis of a single positive serological test in the absence of definite clinical manifestations of the disease.",
        "c. A diagnosis of latent syphilis shall be made on a registrant who has no clinical manifestations of the disease, but whose blood serum has been found positive by a second serological test performed under these regulations and within three months of the first positive serological examination.",
        "d. Syphilis shall be considered contagious only in the presence of skin or mucous-membrane lesions manifested within five years from the date of infection.",
        "SECTION XLVII-EXCERPTS FROM OTHER VOLUMES OF SELECTIVE SERVICE REGULATIONS",

The local board normally shall send the registrant and his Form 200 back to the medical advisory board at the time specified. However, if the local board believes the defect corrected, it may send him back earlier; or if it believes more delay is needed, it may set a later date; or if it decides that further examination is unnecessary, it may proceed without sending him back to the medical advisory board. If in a case of an appeal the local board, after receiving the report of the medical advisory board, determines that the registrant should be reclassified it shall reclassify him in accordance with the rules governing reclassification (section XXX) and shall not forward the appeal to the appeal board.",
        "e. Completing Form 200. All entries made by the medical advisory board on the original Form 200 will be copied by the local board onto the duplicate Form 200 in the registrant\u2019s file.",
