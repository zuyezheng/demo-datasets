        "All United States territorial waters of Honolulu Harbor, Oahu, Territory of Hawaii' its approaches and tributaries from the contour line of extreme high water as shown on the latest U.S.C. and G.S. charts to:",

        "A line running south true from Ahua Point Lighthouse to the seaward limit of United States territorial waters; and, ,",
        "A line running along the seaward limit of United States territorial waters between the above-described bearing lines.",
        "A vessel not proceeding under United States Naval or other United States authorized supervision shall not enter or navigate the waters of the Honolulu Defensive Sea Area except during daylight, when good visibility conditions prevail, and then only after specific permission has been obtained. Advance arrangements for entry into or navigation through or within the Honolulu Defensive Sea Area must be made, preferably at a United States Naval District Headquarters in advance of sailing, or by radio or visual communication on approaching the seaward limit of the area. If radio telegraph is used, the call \"NQO\" shall be made on a frequency of 500 kcs, and permission to enter the port shall be requested. The name of the vessel, purpose of entry, and name of the master must be given in the request. If visual communications are used, the procedure shall be essentially the same.",
        "A vessel entering or navigating the waters of the Honolulu Defensive Sea Area does so at its own risk.",
        "Even though permission has been obtained, it is incumbent upon a vessel entering the Honolulu Defensive Sea Area to obey any further instructions received from the United States Navy, or other United States authority.",
        "A vessel may expect supervision of its movements within the Honolulu Defensive Sea Area, either through surface craft or aircraft. Such controlling surface craft or aircraft will be identified by a prominent display of the Union Jack. The loading or unloading by vessels of oil fuel or other inflammable or explosive materials shall be under the control of the local Naval authority, who shall require such loading or unloading to be accomplished in such manner and at such times as will safeguard the other activities within the Honolulu Defensive Sea Area essential to the national defense.",
        "These regulations are subject to amplification by the local United States Naval authority as necessary to meet local circumstances and conditions.",
        "When a United States Maritime Control Area is established adjacent to or abutting upon the above-established defensive sea area, it shall be assumed that permission to enter, and other instructions issued by proper authority, shall apply to any one continuous passage through or within both areas.",
        "Any master of a vessel or other person within the Honolulu Defensive Sea Area who disregards these regulations, or fails to obey an order of United States Naval authority to stop or heave to, or performs any act threatening the efficiency of mines or other defenses or the safety of navigation, or takes any action inimical to the interests of the United States, may be detained therein by force of arms and shall be liable to attack by United States armed forces, and liable to prosecution as provided for in section 44 of the Criminal Code as amended (U.S.C., title 18, sec. 96).",
        "All United States Government authorities shall place at the disposal of the Naval authorities their facilities for aiding in the enforcement of these regulations. The Governor of the Territory of Hawaii, the local municipal authorities, and the local civilian defense agencies are called upon to render the local Naval authorities all possible assistance in the enforcement of these regulations.",
        "This order shall not be construed as modifying in any way the proclamation of the Governor of the Territory of Hawaii placing the Territory of Hawaii under martial law.",
        "The Secretary of the Navy is charged with the publication and enforcement of these regulations.",
