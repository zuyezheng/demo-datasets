    "content": [
        "Rose A. Conway, the personal secretary of former President Truman, is subject to mandatory retirement in September, 1972, unless specifically exempted from the provisions of the civil service retirement law.",
        "In my judgment, the public interest would be well served if Miss Conway were indefinitely exempted from mandatory retirement. She is not only invaluable in coordinating the staff of Mr. Truman, but her close knowledge of Mr. Truman's activities over many years provides a continuity which should be maintained. Miss Conway's contributions to this Nation have been in the highest traditions of the civil service.",
        "Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 8335 of title 5, United States Code, I hereby exempt Rose A. Conway from mandatory retirement for an indefinite period of time.",
        "Except as the authority vested in the President by section 8335 of title 5, United States Code, is specifically exercised in this Order, nothing contained in this Order shall be deemed to limit or restrict in any manner the exercise of such authority by the Civil Service Commission under authority delegated to the Commission by section 1 of Executive Order 11228 of June 14, 1965.",
