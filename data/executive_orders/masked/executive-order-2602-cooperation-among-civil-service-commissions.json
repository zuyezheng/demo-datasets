        "The cooperation of state, county and municipal civil service commissions with the United States Civil Service Commission is desirable in the existing exigency in meeting the needs of the Federal Government for appointment in the civil service. The United States Civil Service Commission is accordingly authorized in its discretion to adopt as its own any eligible register of any such commission, with the consent of such commission. The United States Civil Service Commission must be satisfied that the examinations by such state, county or municipal commissions conform to the requirements of competition prescribed by the United States Civil Service Act and Rules, and that the examinations are fairly the equivalent of its own. The eligibles thus utilized may be certified and appointed in the order of their grades in the same manner as though they had passed the Federal examination, and shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges pertaining to persons examined under the United States Civil Service Act.",
