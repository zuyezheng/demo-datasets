    "content": [
        "Whereas widespread stoppages have occurred in the coal industry and strikes are threatened which will obstruct the effective prosecution of the war by curtailing vitally needed production in the coal mines directly affecting the countless war industries and transportation systems dependent upon such mines; and",
        "Whereas it has become necessary for the effective prosecution of the war that the coal mines in which stoppages or strikes have occurred, or are threatened, be taken over by the Government of the United States in order to protect the interests of the nation at war and the rights of workers to continue at work:",
        "Now, Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States particularly the War Labor Disputes Act, (Public Law 89, 78th Congress), as President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, it is hereby ordered as follows:",
        "The Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to take immediate possession, so far as may be necessary or desirable, of any and all mines producing coal in which a strike or stoppage has occurred or is threatened, together with any and all real and personal property, franchises, rights, facilities, funds, and other assets used in connection with the operation of such mines, and to operate or arrange for the operation of such mines in such manner as he deems necessary for the successful prosecution of the war, and to do all things necessary for or incidental to the production, sale and distribution of coal.",
        "In carrying out this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall act through or with the aid of such public or private instrumentalities or persons as he may designate. He shall permit the management to continue its managerial functions to the maximum degree possible consistent with the aims of this order.",
        "The Secretary of the Interior shall make employment available and provide protection to all employees resuming work at such mines and to all persons seeking employment so far as they may be needed; and upon the request of the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of War shall take such action, if any, as he may deem necessary or desirable to provide protection to all such persons and mines.",
        "The Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to maintain customary working conditions in the mines and customary procedure for the adjustment of workers' grievances. He shall recognize the right of the workers to continue their membership in any labor organization, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection provided that such concerted activities do not interfere with the operations of the mines.",
        "The Secretary of the Interior is further authorized and directed to offer to the duly constituted representatives of the workers' own choosing a contract or contracts governing the terms and conditions of employment for the period of the operation of the mines by the Government, in accordance with the opinion of the National War Labor Board in the matter of Illinois Coal Operators Association and United Mine Workers of America of October 26, 1943, and with such further directives as may be given by the War Labor Board. When any such contract has been agreed upon, the Secretary of the Interior shall apply under section 5 of the War Labor Disputes Act to the National War Labor Board for the approval of such contract and such changes in the terms and conditions of employment as may be authorized therein.",
        "Possession and operation of any mine or mines hereunder shall be terminated by the Secretary of the Interior as soon as he determines that possession and operation hereunder are no longer required for the furtherance of the war program, but in no event more than sixty days after the restoration of the productive efficiency thereof prevailing prior to the taking possession thereof.",
        "Nothing in this order shall be construed to repeal or amend Executive Order No. 9370 dated August 16, 1943, authorizing the Economic Stabilization Director to take certain action in connection with the enforcement of directives of the National War Labor Board.",
