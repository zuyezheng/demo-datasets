        "The Executive Order of June 22, 1928, amending previous executive orders requiring candidates for appointment to presidential postmasterships to pass a civil service examination, is hereby waived to permit the nomination of Ward M. Parker as postmaster at Venice, Florida, without examination.",
        "This order is issued upon the recommendation of the Postmaster General. The Civil Service Commission reports that, as a result of three examinations announced for filling this position, only one eligible has been secured and that further examinations would probably not result in securing enough eligibles for a complete certification of three names to the Postmaster General.",
