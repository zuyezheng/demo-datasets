        "By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by the act approved June 20, 1936, entitled \"An Act Relating to the admissibility in evidence of certain writings and records made in the regular course of business\" (Public No. 734, 74th Cong.), and by section 1752 of the Revised Statutes (U.S.C., title 22, sec. 132), I hereby prescribe the following regulations governing the authentication of certified copies of documents of record or on file in a public office of a foreign country or a political subdivision thereof, the manner in which consular or diplomatic officers shall execute and return commissions issued in criminal cases under the provisions of the said act of June 20, 1936, and schedules of fees and compensation allowable in such cases.",
        "Section 482A of the Consular Regulations is prescribed as follows:",
        "\"482A. Certification of foreign public documents. Any consular officer of the United States is authorized to authenticate a certified copy of any document of record or on file in a public office of the foreign country in which he resides, or of a political subdivision thereof, by a certificate under the seal of his office certifying that such document has been certified by the lawful custodian of such document. (Sec. 6, act of June 20, 1936.) \"",
        "Section 489 of the Consular Regulations is amended to read as follows:",
        "\"CIVIL CASES",
        "\"489. Commission to take testimony in civil cases. When a court in the United States appoints a consular officer commissioner to take testimony in a foreign country for the use of that court, the commission usually is accompanied by interrogatories and full instructions which the consular officer must carefully follow. The consular officer acts both in his official consular capacity and as an officer of the court which issues the commission. (22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 98.131.)",
        "\"The charges in such cases are official and must be in strict accordance with the Tariff of United States Consular Fees. (22 U.S.C. \u00a7 127.) When it is necessary to insure payment of such fees, the consular officer is authorized to retain the papers committed to him in connection with such service until the prescribed fees, for which he is responsible to the Government, have been paid. (22 U.S.C. \u00a7 93.)\"",
        "Sections 489A to 489T, inclusive, of the Consular Regulations are prescribed as follows:",
        "\"CRIMINAL CASES",
        "\"489A. Purposes of and compliance with commission. Any book, paper, statement, record, account, writing, or other document, or any portion thereof, of whatever character and in whatever form, as well as any copy thereof equally with the original, which is not in the United States (hereinafter referred to as a foreign document) shall, when duly certified as provided in section 489P, be admissible in evidence in any criminal action or proceeding in any court of the United States if the court shall find, from all the testimony taken with respect to such foreign document pursuant to a commission executed as hereinafter provided, that such document (or the original thereof in case such document is a copy) was made in the regular course of any business and that it was the regular course of such business to make such document. The term \"business\" shall include business, profession, occupation, and calling of every kind. (Secs. 1-2, act of June 20, 1936.)",
        "\"For the purpose of determining whether any foreign documents sought to be used in any criminal action or proceeding in any court of the United States are genuine, and whether the requirements above set forth are satisfied with respect to any such document (or the original thereof in case such document is a copy), the court may issue a commission to take the testimony of any witness in a foreign country either on oral or written interrogatories, or on interrogatories partly oral and partly written. (Sec. 3(a), act of June 20, 1936.)",
        "\"When the court shall issue a commission addressed to a consular officer (hereinafter referred to as the commissioner) for the purposes aforesaid, the commissioner shall thoroughly acquaint himself with the powers vested in him by virtue of the commission and with the instructions contained therein, and, in executing and returning such commission shall be governed by such instructions and by these regulations. Specific instructions contained in such a commission as to the manner of executing and returning that commission shall be followed although they are not in accord with the general directions contained In these regulations. (Sec. 4, act of June 20, 1936.)",
        "\"489B. Disqualification of commissioner. Any commissioner who is interested in the outcome of the action or proceeding in connection with which the commission Issued, or who has participated In the prosecution of such action or proceeding, whether by investigations, preparation of evidence, or otherwise, or who directly or indirectly bears to any party to such action or proceeding such a relation by blood or otherwise as would warrant a presumption of bias or prejudice in favor of or against such party, may be disqualified from executing the commission upon his own motion. Upon receipt of a commission, the commissioner shall forthwith determine whether he has reason to believe that he is subject to disqualification for any of the reasons above stated. If he so determines, he shall forthwith communicate his motion to disqualify himself, together with the grounds upon which he bases such motion, directly to the clerk of the court from which the commission issued. Upon receipt of notice from the clerk that his motion has been allowed, he shall forthwith forward the commission under seal to the consular officer named in the commission, or in the notice, as alternate commissioner. Upon receipt of notice that his motion has been disallowed, he shall proceed to execute and return the commission as if his motion had not been made. (Sec. 3(b), act of June 20, 1936.)",
        "\"489C. Selection of attorneys. Any party to the action or proceeding who has selected an attorney to represent him at the execution of a commission may communicate such selection, or may communicate a list of attorneys with his order of preference stated, to the commissioner, and the commissioner shall attempt, on behalf of such party, to obtain the services of such attorney or one of such attorneys, upon such terms as are prescribed by the party.

        "\"489F. Oath of interpreter or translator. If the services of an interpreter are needed, the commissioner may act as such, or if he so desires, or if any party or his attorney so requests, he shall employ one qualified to act in that capacity. (Sec. 4, act of June 20, 1936.) The commissioner shall administer to any interpreter so employed an oath substantially in the following form, or in an equivalent form used in the country where the commission is executed:",
        "\"You do solemnly swear that you know the English and languages and that you will truly and impartially interpret the oath and interrogatories to be administered to ________, a witness now to be examined, out of the English into the ________ language, and that you will truly and impartially interpret the answers of the said ________ thereto out of the ________ language into the English language. So help you God.",
        "\"The commissioner may, when necessary, likewise act as, or employ, a translator and shall administer to a translator so employed an oath in form similar to that prescribed above.",
        "\"489G. Transcription of testimony and oath of stenographer. The commissioner shall determine from each witness whether such witness wishes to answer interrogatories put to him orally or personally to reduce his answers to writing in English. If the witness elects to answer orally, the commissioner may himself reduce the answers to writing, either by pen and ink, typewriter, or shorthand notes later to be transcribed into typewriting. If he so desires, or if any party or his attorney so requests, the commissioner shall employ a stenographer who shall reduce the answers to writing, either by pen and ink, typewriter, or shorthand notes later to be transcribed into typewriting. (Sec. 4, act of June 20, 1936.) The commissioner shall administer to any stenographer so employed an oath substantially in the following form, or in an equivalent form used in the country where the commission is executed:",
        "\"You do solemnly swear that you will truly and impartially reduce to writing (or take and transcribe) the testimony of ________ , a witness now to be examined. So help you God.",

        "\"489I. Affirmations. If any interpreter (or translator), stenographer, or witness objects to being sworn, the commissioner shall substitute for the oath an affirmation substantially in the following form, or in an equivalent form used in the country where the commission is executed:",
        "\"You do solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm, under the pains and penalty for perjury, that * * * (here substitute proper wording from appropriate oath, omitting the words \u2018so help you God'). (1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.)",
        "\"489J. Examination as to personal knowledge. The commissioner may at any time during the examination of a witness propound such inquiries as may be necessary to satisfy himself that the witness is, or is not, testifying of his personal knowledge of the subject matter of the examination. The commissioner shall have noted in the transcript of testimony the fact that the witness at a particular time referred to notes, papers, or other documents, and the commissioner's opinion as to whether the witness was using such notes, papers, or other documents to refresh his memory or for the sake of testifying to matters not then of his personal knowledge. The commissioner shall have noted in the transcript of testimony that the witness conferred with counsel before answering any interrogatory, and shall request the witness not to leave his presence during the examination. Failure to comply with the commissioner's request shall be noted in the transcript. (Sec. 4, act of June 20, 1936.)",
        "\"489K. Written interrogatories. Where the examination is conducted upon written interrogatories, the interrogatories shall not be repeated in the transcript but an appropriate reference to each interrogatory shall be inserted preceding the answer of the witness. The interrogatories shall be put to the witness by the commissioner separately and in order, and the answer to each interrogatory shall be recorded. All of the written interrogatories shall be put to the witness even though, at some point during the examination, the witness disclaims further knowledge of the subject.",
        "\"489L. Oral interrogatories. Where the examination is conducted upon oral interrogatories, the direct examination (by the counsel representing the party on whose application the commission issued) shall be first completed, without interruption except in the form of an objection by opposing counsel. Cross-examination by opposing counsel under similar conditions may then be conducted and may be followed by re-direct and re-cross examinations until the examination is completed. The commissioner shall endeavor to restrain colloquies between counsel or attempts on the part of counsel to intimidate or mislead witnesses.",
        "\"489M. Written and oral interrogatories. When counsel for all of the parties attend the examination of any witness, and the examination of the witness is upon written interrogatories, the commissioner shall, all counsel having consented thereto, permit oral examination of the witness following the close of the examination upon written interrogatories. The oral examination shall be conducted in the same manner and order as if not preceded by an examination upon written interrogatories. (Sec. 4, act of June 20, 1936.)",
        "\"489N. Objections. When counsel objects to an interrogatory, answer, or other matter for any reason, the commissioner shall have noted in the transcript only the objection and the reasons stated therefor. Colloquies between counsel shall not be included in the transcript. The commissioner shall not pass upon any objection made, but shall request the witness to answer every interrogatory even though an objection is made to it. Refusal of any witness to answer an interrogatory put to him shall be noted in the transcript together with the reason, if any, given by the witness for his refusal.",
        "\"489O. Transcripts. The transcript shall be prepared in question-and-answer form; never in narrative form. It shall be securely attached to the document or documents to which the testimony contained therein pertains. The transcript shall then be read to or by the witness in the presence of the commissioner, and any corrections which the witness desires to make in his testimony shall be noted in the transcript. The witness shall then be requested to subscribe each page of the transcript and of the document or documents, and to initial in the margin each correction in the transcript made at his request. (Sec. 4, act of June 20, 1936.)",
        "\"489P. Commissioner's return. The caption of the commissioner's return shall be in the precise form used in the commission.

        "\"489Q. Executed commission returned to court. The transcripts of testimony, documents, and return of the commissioner shall be securely attached to the commission, wrapped, and transmitted by mail to the clerk of the court from which the commission issued in the same manner in which the commissioner prepares and transmits his official despatches to the Government.

When, however, it is necessary to procure the attendance of a witness on behalf of the United States or an indigent party, an officer or agent of the United States may negotiate with the witness to pay compensation at such higher rate as may be approved by the Attorney General, plus the mileage allowance stated above. The compensation and mileage of each witness shall be paid by the party, or parties, applying for the commission unless the commission is accompanied by an order of court that all fees, compensation, and other expenses authorized by these regulations are chargeable to the United States under section 7(b) of the act of June 20, 1936.

Other expenses authorized by these regulations shall be paid by the commissioner as they are incurred.",
        "\"When chargeable to the United States.
