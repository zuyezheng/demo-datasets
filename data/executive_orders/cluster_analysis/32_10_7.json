    "analysis": "The documents consist of executive orders from different presidential administrations. They share a common theme of establishing councils, working groups, or designating liaisons within federal agencies to address specific issues. The issues range from volunteer community service and food safety to educational resource equity, energy efficiency, international exchanges, and non-proliferation. Many of the orders create advisory bodies or assign responsibilities to existing agencies to study, coordinate, and improve government efforts in these areas. A common sentiment is a commitment to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of government programs through better coordination and strategic planning.",
