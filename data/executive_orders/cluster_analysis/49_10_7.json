    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to the revocation of previous executive orders that had withdrawn public lands from disposition, followed by the opening of those lands for homestead and desert-land entry by qualified ex-service men for a 91-day period, and then to the general public. The lands are in various states (New Mexico, Wyoming, California, Nevada, Colorado, Washington). The orders cite Public Resolution 85 of June 12, 1930, or public resolution No. 29 of February 14, 1920, as amended, which grants preferential treatment to ex-service men.",
