    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern amendments to civil service rules and regulations, departmental rules, and postal rules. They detail changes to examination requirements, exceptions to those requirements for specific positions, and modifications to appointment and transfer procedures within various government departments, including Agriculture, Treasury, Interior, Post Office, and the Indian Service. Some orders address specific roles like wood engravers, fish culturists, clerks, and scientific employees, while others cover broader categories like special agents and penitentiary employees. The documents reflect efforts to refine the civil service system, often by adjusting the scope of competitive examinations and clarifying the rules for hiring and promotion.",
