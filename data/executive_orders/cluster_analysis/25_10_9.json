    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the reservation, withdrawal, or modification of public lands in Arizona and New Mexico. These actions are taken for various purposes, including irrigation projects for Native Americans, military uses (rifle ranges, aviation), townsite development, and wildlife refuges. A recurring theme is the temporary nature of these land adjustments, often subject to existing rights and claims, and the possibility of future revocation or modification.",
