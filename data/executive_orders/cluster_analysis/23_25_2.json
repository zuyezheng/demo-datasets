    "analysis": "The documents in this cluster are all executive orders signed by President Harry S. Truman. They primarily concern amendments, delegations of authority, and modifications to existing orders, acts, and regulations. The subject matter spans a wide range, including the Panama Canal, Puerto Rico's judicial system, coffee agreements, foreign service personnel, career compensation, continental shelf resources, civil service, civil defense, migratory labor, and foreign service allowances. A common thread is the adjustment and refinement of existing legal and administrative frameworks.",
