    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to the extension of trust periods for Native American lands. These extensions were issued by Presidents Hoover, Roosevelt, and Truman, and they cite the authority of specific acts of Congress, particularly the Act of February 8, 1887. The extensions generally apply to lands where the trust periods are set to expire during a specific calendar year, and the extension is usually for a period of 10 or 25 years. A common theme is the protection of Native American lands from alienation.",
