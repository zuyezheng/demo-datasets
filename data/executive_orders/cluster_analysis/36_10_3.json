They cover a range of topics, including natural resources, critical minerals, COVID-19 response, climate change, trade, higher education, government personnel, and law enforcement. Despite the variety of topics, a common thread is the attempt to direct government policy and action through executive authority. Many of the orders establish task forces, direct agency actions, or modify existing regulations.",
