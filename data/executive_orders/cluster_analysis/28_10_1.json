    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the implementation and administration of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. They cover a range of topics including the establishment of boards and committees, delegation of authority, approval of codes of fair competition for various industries (textile, needlework, laundry, tanning extract), labor relations, and funding allocations related to NIRA. The sentiment is generally positive, reflecting the Roosevelt administration's efforts to address the economic crisis of the Great Depression through government intervention and regulation.",
