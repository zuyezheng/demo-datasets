    "analysis": "The documents in this cluster are all Executive Orders. They share a common structure and boilerplate language, including a section on 'General Provisions' with similar wording. The documents cover a wide range of topics, from public health and national security to economic policy and government efficiency. A key commonality is that they all direct executive branch agencies to take specific actions or implement certain policies. Many of the orders also revoke previous executive orders, indicating a change in policy direction.",
