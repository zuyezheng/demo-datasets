    "analysis": "The documents involve transferring or restoring land, often between the federal government and territorial or state governments. Many relate to military reservations or land previously used for military purposes. Several documents concern land in Hawaii. Some documents also relate to establishing or modifying reservations for other purposes, such as bird refuges or lighthouses. The documents frequently describe the land using metes and bounds, coordinates, and references to existing surveys and landmarks.",
