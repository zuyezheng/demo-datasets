    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the transfer, restoration, or reservation of land, often involving military reservations, naval facilities, or other government uses. A recurring theme is the adjustment of land boundaries and usage rights between the U.S. government and the Territory/State of Hawaii, as well as the Panama Canal Zone. Many orders involve restoring land to the Territory of Hawaii that was previously used for military purposes. The documents frequently describe specific geographical locations, often including coordinates and references to existing surveys and landmarks.",
