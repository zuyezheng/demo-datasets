    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the withdrawal or reservation of public lands for various purposes, including military use (bombing ranges, aviation), soil erosion control, national forest expansion, ranger stations, and lookout stations. They often involve specific land descriptions using meridians, townships, ranges, and sections. Some orders revoke or amend previous orders related to land classification. The documents span from 1929 to 1942, covering the presidencies of Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt.",
