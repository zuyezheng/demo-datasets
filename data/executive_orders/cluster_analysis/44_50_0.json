    "analysis": "The documents in this cluster primarily concern the allocation, transfer, and management of funds and resources during times of emergency, particularly in the context of the Great Depression and related relief efforts. They establish agencies, appoint administrators, define duties, and authorize expenditures for various programs, including public works, agricultural assistance, and aid to specific regions like Puerto Rico. A recurring theme is the delegation of authority and the modification of existing orders to adapt to changing circumstances. Some orders also address specific issues like labor regulations, price controls, and quarantine measures.",
