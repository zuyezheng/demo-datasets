    "analysis": "The documents in this cluster cover a diverse range of topics, including energy policy, international relations (Panama and Democratic Republic of the Congo), artificial intelligence, worker safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-Semitism, global development, regulatory reform, mental health and substance abuse, and preventing hoarding during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the variety, a common thread is the use of executive authority to address perceived national issues and implement specific policies. The documents also share a focus on establishing councils, task forces, or working groups to advise the President and coordinate efforts across different government agencies. Many of the documents also delegate authority to specific cabinet members or agency heads to carry out the directives outlined in the order.",
