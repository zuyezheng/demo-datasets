    "analysis": "The documents consist of executive orders from different presidential administrations. They cover a wide range of topics, including climate change, immigration, national security, public benefits, the Second Amendment, supply chains, fitness and nutrition, financial literacy, military decorations, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Despite the variety of subjects, all documents share a common structure and purpose: they are directives issued by the President to executive departments and agencies, aiming to establish policies, modify existing regulations, or delegate authority. Many of the orders also address actions taken by previous administrations, either reinforcing or reversing them.",
