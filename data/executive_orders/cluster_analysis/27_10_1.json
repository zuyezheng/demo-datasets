    "analysis": "The documents consist of executive orders that establish, modify, or cancel land reservations for Native American tribes. They specify geographical boundaries, often using township and range coordinates, and withdraw the designated lands from public sale or settlement. The orders aim to provide land for the use and occupancy of specific tribes, such as the Pima, Maricopa, Mescalero Apaches, Mission Indians, Iowa, and Papago. Some orders modify previous orders or address existing rights to the land.",
