    "analysis": "The documents in this cluster are all Executive Orders that establish or modify interagency councils, committees, or task forces. These groups are created to address specific issues, such as administrative management, faith-based initiatives, salary comparability, government-university research partnerships, integrity of Inspectors General, disaster information, drug use in sports, the future of a specific town, combating trafficking in persons, recreational fisheries, and open competition in construction projects. The orders often delegate authority to specific individuals or agencies and emphasize interagency coordination and cooperation. A recurring theme is the improvement of government operations and the efficient use of resources. Many of the orders include a disclaimer stating that they are intended for internal management and do not create any enforceable rights.",
