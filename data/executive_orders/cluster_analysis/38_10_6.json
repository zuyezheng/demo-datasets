    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to extending trust periods on land allotments made to Native American tribes and individuals. The extensions are typically for ten years, but one is for twenty-five years. The orders cite various acts of Congress as the source of authority for these extensions, particularly the act of February 8, 1887, and the act of June 21, 1906. Some orders include provisos related to the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. The documents span the presidencies of Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Harry S. Truman.",
