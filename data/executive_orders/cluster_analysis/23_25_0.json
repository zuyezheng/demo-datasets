    "analysis": "The documents consist of executive orders, mostly issued by President Truman, that delegate authority, amend previous orders, or establish regulations related to various governmental functions and departments. Common themes include internal management of the government, foreign affairs, military matters, and adjustments to existing laws and regulations. Many orders address specific acts, appropriations, or sections of law, modifying or clarifying their implementation. There's a focus on streamlining processes, transferring responsibilities between agencies, and adapting to changing circumstances like the post-war period or national emergencies.",
