They cover a range of topics including economic policy, veteran employment, land reservation for military purposes, gun violence reduction, land withdrawal for reclamation, transfer of personnel functions, land transfer for military use, revocation of power-site reserve, termination of national emergency related to Liberia, and allowances for military personnel.
