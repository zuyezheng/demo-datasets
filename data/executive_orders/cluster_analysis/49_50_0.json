    "analysis": "The documents all concern the revocation of previous executive orders that had withdrawn public lands, often for the purpose of resurvey. Following the revocation, the lands are opened for entry under homestead or desert land laws, initially for a 91-day period for qualified ex-service men, and then to the general public. The documents specify the townships and ranges affected by the revocation.",
