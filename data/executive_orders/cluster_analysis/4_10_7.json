    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern land transfers and modifications of national forest boundaries. Some documents address the acquisition and transfer of land between government departments (Agriculture, War, Interior) for purposes such as military reservations or historical monuments. Others deal with adjustments to national forest boundaries, consolidation of forests, or exclusion of land from a national forest. A couple of documents concern other matters: one rejects bids for real estate and another designates a clerk to sign land patents. However, the majority relate to land management and transfer.",
