    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern land management and resource allocation in Arizona and New Mexico. They involve transferring land control between government departments (Interior, Treasury, War), establishing or modifying Indian reservations, creating wildlife refuges, and adjusting land withdrawals for various purposes like federal buildings, state selections, and military use. Some orders amend or revoke previous orders related to land use. The documents reflect government efforts to balance competing land claims and resource needs.",
