    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to the extension of trust periods for land allotments made to Native American individuals and tribes. The extensions were authorized by various acts of Congress, primarily the Act of February 8, 1887, and the Act of June 21, 1906. The documents specify the tribes, reservations, and in some cases, individual allottees affected by the extensions. The extensions are typically for periods of 10 or 25 years. Some orders include exceptions to the extensions. The documents span from 1920 to 1951 and involve multiple presidential administrations.",
