    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to the extension of trust periods on land allotments made to Native American tribes and individuals. The extensions are authorized by various acts of Congress, primarily the Act of February 8, 1887, and the Act of June 21, 1906. The documents specify the tribes, reservations, and individuals affected, as well as the duration of the extensions (typically 10 or 25 years). Some orders include exceptions for specific allotments or individuals. The orders are issued by different presidents (Coolidge, Hoover, Roosevelt, Truman) and span from 1917 to 1950.",
