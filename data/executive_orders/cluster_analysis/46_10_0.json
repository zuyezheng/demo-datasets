    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern adjustments to the pay scales for various government employees, including those in the uniformed services, the general schedule, the foreign service, the Veterans Health Administration, senior executives, and administrative law judges. They also address locality-based comparability payments. The documents span several decades, from the 1930s to the 2020s, and are issued by different presidents. A common theme is the adjustment of pay scales to maintain uniformity and comparability, and to account for economic changes and cost of living.",
