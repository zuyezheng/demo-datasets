    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the modification, revocation, or creation of land reserves (power sites, water reserves, petroleum reserves, potash reserves) and withdrawals for various purposes (highway construction, flood control, national monument consideration) across different states (Idaho, Utah, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, California).
