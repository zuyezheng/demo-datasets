    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to the withdrawal of public lands, often in Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, and Mississippi, from settlement, location, sale, or entry. The withdrawals are for various purposes, including use as a lookout station, pending a resurvey, for agricultural experiment purposes, for elk refuge purposes, for public water reserves, in connection with Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 3, and for the improvement of the flood channel of the Big Black River. The documents frequently cite the act of June 25, 1910, as amended by the act of August 24, 1912, as the authority for the withdrawals. Some orders modify or revoke previous orders related to land withdrawals.",
