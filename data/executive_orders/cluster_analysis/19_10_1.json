    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to exemptions from mandatory retirement for government employees. They cite the same legal authority (section 204 of the act of June 30, 1932) and generally state that the public interest requires the exemption. The exemptions are usually for one year, though some are for six months or an indefinite period. Many of the employees work in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing or other Treasury Department roles, but other departments are represented as well.",
