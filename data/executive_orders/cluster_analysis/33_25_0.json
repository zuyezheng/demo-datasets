    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to the establishment of refuges and breeding grounds for migratory birds and other wildlife. They delineate specific areas of land, often including lakes or bodies of water, and prohibit hunting, trapping, or disturbance of wildlife within these areas. The documents specify the responsible department (either Agriculture or Interior) and often cite the Migratory Bird Conservation Act as the legal basis for the reservation. Many of the refuges are located in North Dakota, but other states like Wyoming, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, Minnesota, Arizona, Montana, Nebraska and Washington are also represented. The orders often include detailed descriptions of the land being reserved, using township, range, and section numbers.",
