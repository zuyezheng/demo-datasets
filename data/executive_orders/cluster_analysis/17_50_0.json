    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the transfer, reservation, restoration, or modification of land, often involving military reservations, lighthouse sites, airports, and other government facilities. Many of the documents pertain to land in Hawaii, Alaska, and the Canal Zone, with some also referencing locations in California, Puerto Rico, and other US territories or possessions. A recurring theme is the adjustment of land use between different government departments (e.g., Navy, War Department, Treasury, Interior) or between the federal government and territorial/state governments. Descriptions of land boundaries, often using precise coordinates and survey markers, are common.",
