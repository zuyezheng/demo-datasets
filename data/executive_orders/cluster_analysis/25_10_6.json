    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the withdrawal or reservation of public lands, often in Arizona and New Mexico, for various purposes including military use (bombing ranges, target practice), protection of water sources for Native American communities, customs services, and resettlement of farm families. Some orders amend or revoke previous orders related to land use. The sentiment is neutral, focusing on legal and administrative actions.",
