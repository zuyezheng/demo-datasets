    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to the extension of trust periods for land allotments made to Native American individuals and tribes. These extensions prevent the alienation of these lands, ensuring they remain under federal protection. The documents cite various acts of Congress as the legal basis for these extensions, including the Act of February 8, 1887, the Act of June 21, 1906, and the Act of March 2, 1917. The extensions are typically for periods of 10 or 25 years, and many orders specify exceptions to the general extension, often listing individual allottees or groups not covered by the order. The documents span several presidential administrations, from Woodrow Wilson to Harry S. Truman, indicating a long-standing federal policy.",
