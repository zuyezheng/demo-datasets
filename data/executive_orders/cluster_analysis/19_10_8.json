    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to exemptions from mandatory retirement for government employees. They cite the same legal authority (section 204 of the act of June 30, 1932) and state that the exemption is in the public interest. The exemptions are typically for one-year periods, though some are for indefinite periods within the employee's term. The positions held by the employees are varied, ranging from auditors and mineral technologists to secret service agents and members of commissions.",
