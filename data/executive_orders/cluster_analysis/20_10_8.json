    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the withdrawal and reservation of public lands, often for specific purposes such as use by the Forest Service, ranger stations, elk refuges, or pending land surveys. A common legislative basis for these actions is the Act of Congress approved June 25, 1910, as amended. Some orders also revoke previous orders related to land use or reservations.",
