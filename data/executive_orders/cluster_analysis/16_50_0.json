    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to labor disputes that threaten to interrupt interstate commerce. They involve various transportation industries, including airlines, railroads, and maritime companies, and a variety of labor unions. The disputes have not been resolved through standard mediation processes, leading to the creation of presidential boards of inquiry or emergency boards to investigate and report on the issues. A common element is the invocation of the Railway Labor Act or the Labor-Management Relations Act to address these disputes. The boards are typically composed of neutral members who are tasked with investigating the disputes and providing recommendations to the President within a 30-day timeframe. During this period and for a specified time afterward, changes to the conditions that led to the dispute are prohibited, except by agreement.",
