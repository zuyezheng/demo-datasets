    "analysis": "The documents consist of executive orders, mostly from Franklin D. Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover, that involve the withdrawal or reservation of public lands. The purposes for these actions vary, including use by the Alaska Railroad, soil erosion control, additions to national forests, wildlife refuges, agricultural experiments, and ranger stations. Many orders revoke or amend previous orders. The documents specify land descriptions using legal descriptions (township, range, section).",
