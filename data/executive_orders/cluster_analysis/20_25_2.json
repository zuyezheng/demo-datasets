    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the allocation, withdrawal, reservation, or revocation of public lands for various purposes, including use by government departments (War, Agriculture, Interior, Commerce), national forests, power sites, aviation, and other public uses like ranger stations, lookout stations, and experimental ranges. Many orders modify or revoke previous orders related to land use. The documents specify land descriptions using township, range, and section coordinates.",
