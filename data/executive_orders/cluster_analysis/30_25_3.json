    "analysis": "The documents all relate to the designation of various international organizations as public international organizations, granting them certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities under the International Organizations Immunities Act. The documents specify the legal basis for the designation, often referencing treaties, acts of Congress, or other agreements that establish U.S. participation in these organizations. The organizations span a wide range of interests, including hydrography, satellite communications, finance, intellectual property, energy, fisheries, boundary and water management, regional development, meteorology, migration, criminal justice, conservation, trade, tourism, and health. Some orders also amend previous orders to include or exclude specific organizations or provisions.",
