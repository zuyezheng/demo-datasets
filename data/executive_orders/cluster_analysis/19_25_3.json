    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to exemptions from mandatory retirement for government employees. They cite the same legal authority (section 204 of the act of June 30, 1932) and follow a similar structure, beginning with 'Whereas, in my judgment, the public interest requires that...' and then stating 'Now, Therefore...'. The exemptions are typically for one-year periods, though some are for indefinite periods or six-month periods. The positions held by the employees vary widely, from engineers and managers to clerks and curators.",
