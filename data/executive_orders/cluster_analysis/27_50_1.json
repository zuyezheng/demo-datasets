    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the establishment, modification, and alteration of Indian reservations across various states and territories of the United States. They involve setting aside land for the use and occupancy of specific tribes, adjusting boundaries, and occasionally restoring land to the public domain. The documents often describe geographical boundaries using landmarks, rivers, and surveyed lines. The sentiment is neutral, focusing on legal and administrative actions.",
