They cover a range of topics including military matters (sale of combatant vessels, protection of harbors), war production and labor (operation of rubber plants, necessity certificates), management of alien property, scientific research, war crimes prosecution, and surplus property disposal. A common theme is the exercise of presidential power under the First and Second War Powers Acts to address wartime and immediate post-war needs.",
