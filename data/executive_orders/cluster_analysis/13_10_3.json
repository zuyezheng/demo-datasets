    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern actions taken during World War I and World War II by Presidents Roosevelt and Wilson. They involve the government seizing control of private entities like shipbuilding companies and coal mines to ensure war production, managing economic defense, and providing financial support to war production efforts. Some orders address the transfer of functions and duties between government entities, including the management of alien property and the establishment of divisions for war-related public information. A common theme is the use of executive power to mobilize resources and manage the economy for the war effort.",
