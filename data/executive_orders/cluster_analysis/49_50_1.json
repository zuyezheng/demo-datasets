    "analysis": "The documents all relate to the revocation of previous executive orders that had withdrawn public lands from general disposition, often pending a resurvey. Following the revocation, the lands are opened to entry primarily by qualified ex-service men under homestead or desert land laws for a 91-day period, after which the general public can appropriate the land under any applicable public land law. The documents span the presidencies of Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt and reference Public Resolution 85 or Public Resolution 29, which provided preferential treatment to ex-service men in land entry.",
