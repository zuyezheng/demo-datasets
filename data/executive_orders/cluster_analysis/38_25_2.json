    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to the extension of trust periods for Native American lands. These extensions prevent the alienation of these lands, ensuring they remain under the protection of the federal government for a specified time. The orders specify different tribes, reservations, and individual allottees, with trust periods extended for varying durations, typically 10 or 25 years. Some orders also include exceptions or stipulations related to specific acts of Congress or tribal elections.",
