    "analysis": "The documents all relate to the withdrawal or revocation of withdrawal of public lands for various reasons, often pending or following a resurvey. The documents specify land locations using township and range coordinates, and they cite the Act of June 25, 1910, as amended, as the legal authority for these actions. Some revocations are tied to the filing of resurvey plats, while others enable different uses of the land.",
