    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern land management in Arizona and New Mexico. A significant portion of the documents relate to land being set aside or modified for use by Native American tribes, including additions to reservations, allotments, and addressing their welfare. Another common theme is the allocation of land for military purposes, such as target ranges, aviation, and bombing practice. Additionally, some documents deal with land transfers between government departments (Agriculture, Interior, Treasury) for various purposes like wildlife refuges, agricultural projects, and administrative sites. Resurveys, power site reserves, and the National Industrial Recovery Act are also referenced in connection with land management.",
