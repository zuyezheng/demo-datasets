    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to land use and reservations in Alaska, often involving transfers of land between different federal departments (e.g., War Department, Treasury Department, Department of Agriculture, Alaska Road Commission) for specific purposes like radio stations, federal buildings, aviation, or agricultural experiment stations. Many orders modify or revoke previous orders to accommodate new needs or priorities. The documents frequently describe the land using metes and bounds or references to surveys and coordinate systems.",
