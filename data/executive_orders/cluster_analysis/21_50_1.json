    "analysis": "The documents consist of presidential orders, mostly from the early 20th century (Roosevelt, Hoover, Coolidge, and F. Roosevelt administrations), that waive civil service rules to allow specific individuals to be appointed to government positions. A significant number of these appointments are for women, often widows or daughters of former government employees who died or were disabled, leaving their families in need of support. Some orders also address reinstatements or appointments for individuals who were injured or had prior government service. The sentiment is generally compassionate, aiming to provide relief and support to families of deceased or disabled government employees.",
