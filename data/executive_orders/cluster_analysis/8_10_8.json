    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to executive orders issued by US presidents. They cover a diverse range of topics including budgetary control, combating human trafficking, trade law enforcement, gender-based violence prevention, wildland fire management, public alert and warning systems, recognition of women's history, orders of succession, modification of national emergency scope related to Iraq, and tariffs on Mexican products.
