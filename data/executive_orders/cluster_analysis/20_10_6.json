    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the withdrawal, reservation, and management of public lands by the US government. They involve actions such as temporarily withdrawing land from settlement for classification, reserving land for public use (e.g., fish hatchery, forest service), and reserving rights to fissionable materials. Some orders revoke previous orders related to land use. The documents span multiple presidential administrations (Hoover, Roosevelt, Truman) and reference specific acts of Congress related to land management.",
