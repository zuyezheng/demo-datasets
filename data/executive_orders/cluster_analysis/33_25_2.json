    "analysis": "The documents primarily focus on establishing and modifying land reservations as refuges and breeding grounds for migratory birds and other wildlife, often under the authority of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act. They delineate specific areas, often including detailed land descriptions using the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), and specify that these areas are for the use of the Department of Agriculture. Many orders also include prohibitions against hunting, trapping, and disturbing wildlife within the refuges, with exceptions made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture. Some orders revoke or modify previous orders related to land use or reservations. The documents span from the early to mid-20th century.",
