    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern land management and transfer in Arizona and New Mexico. They involve actions such as withdrawing land from public use, reserving land for specific purposes (wildlife refuge, military use, aviation field), transferring jurisdiction between government departments (Agriculture to Interior), and revoking previous orders related to land use. The documents reflect government efforts to manage land resources, often in response to specific needs like conservation, military preparedness, or economic development.",
