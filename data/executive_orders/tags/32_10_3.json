    "analysis": "The documents in this cluster are all executive orders issued by US Presidents. They cover a diverse range of topics, including privatization of infrastructure, healthcare transparency, relations with Taiwan, software piracy prevention, recreational fishing enhancement, support for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, continuation of advisory committees, Coast Guard roles and missions, Iraqi assets control, and support for historically Black colleges and universities.
