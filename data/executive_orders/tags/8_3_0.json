    "analysis": "The documents consist of executive orders issued by Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump. The common theme is the use of presidential power to address specific issues, both foreign and domestic, through executive action. Document 1 focuses on sanctions related to the conflict in Darfur, Sudan. Document 2 concerns religious freedom and conscience protections within the United States. Document 3 clarifies and amends previous executive orders related to terrorism and donations to sanctioned entities. All three documents invoke presidential authority and reference specific laws like the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the National Emergencies Act (NEA).",
