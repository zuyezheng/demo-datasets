    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to the revocation of previous executive orders that withdrew public lands from general access, pending resurvey. Following the revocation, the lands are opened to homestead and desert land laws entry, specifically for ex-service men for a 91-day period, before becoming available to the general public. The documents specify land locations by township, range, and meridian, and cite public resolutions that govern the land entry process. The sentiment is neutral, as the documents are legal orders.",
