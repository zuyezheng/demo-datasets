    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the establishment, modification, and protection of land reservations for various Native American tribes. They define specific geographical boundaries, often referencing rivers, meridians, and existing landmarks, to delineate these reservations. Some orders address the exclusion of private land claims within the reservation boundaries and the management of resources within these territories. A common theme is the government's role in managing and regulating land use for the benefit of Native American tribes.",
