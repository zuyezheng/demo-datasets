    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the withdrawal, reservation, transfer, or modification of public lands in New Mexico and Arizona. A recurring theme is the use of these lands for various governmental purposes, including military use, Indian reservations, wildlife refuges, and federal buildings. Many orders involve modifications or revocations of previous orders, indicating ongoing adjustments to land management strategies. The documents frequently cite the authority of specific acts of Congress, particularly the act of June 25, 1910, as amended. The sentiment is neutral, focusing on legal and administrative actions.",
