    "analysis": "The documents all concern the revocation of previous executive orders that had withdrawn public lands pending resurvey. Following the revocation, the lands are opened to entry under homestead or desert-land laws, with a 91-day priority period for qualified ex-service men, after which the general public can appropriate the land under any applicable public-land law. The documents all reference Public Resolution 85 of June 12, 1930, or Public Resolution No. 29 of February 14, 1920, as amended, which grants preferential treatment to ex-service men.",
