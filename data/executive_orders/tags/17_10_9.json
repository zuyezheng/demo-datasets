    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the modification, restoration, or transfer of land and property, often involving military reservations, naval facilities, or other government-controlled areas. Many documents involve adjustments to land descriptions, rights of way, or jurisdictions between different government entities or between the government and private entities.
