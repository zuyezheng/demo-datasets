    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to the revocation of previous executive orders that had withdrawn public lands for resurvey. Following the revocation, the lands are opened for entry under homestead or desert land laws, initially for a 91-day period for qualified ex-service men, and then to the general public. The documents specify townships and ranges in various states (Wyoming, New Mexico, Utah, California, Arizona) and reference specific Public Resolutions (primarily No. 85 of June 12, 1930, and No. 29 of February 14, 1920).",
