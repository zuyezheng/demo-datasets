    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern land management and resource allocation in New Mexico and Arizona. They involve actions such as restoring land to the public domain, withdrawing land for specific uses (Navajo Indians, War Department, Civil Aeronautics Authority, Forest Service, Soil Conservation Service, federal building), modifying previous orders, and transferring jurisdiction between government departments (Agriculture and Interior). Many orders involve Native American land or resources. The documents reflect the government's role in managing land use, balancing competing interests, and responding to changing needs.",
