    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to the revocation of previous executive orders that had withdrawn public lands from general access, followed by a re-opening of these lands for homesteading and desert land entry, specifically prioritizing qualified ex-service men for a 91-day period. This action is consistently linked to Public Resolution 85, approved June 12, 1930, which grants service recognition to these veterans.
