    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to the establishment or modification of wildlife refuges, primarily for migratory birds, by presidential order. They delineate specific areas of land and water, often described by survey coordinates, and prohibit activities like hunting or disturbing wildlife within these areas. The refuges are managed by either the Department of Agriculture or the Interior. Some orders also address existing rights, reclamation projects, or cooperative agreements with state entities.",
