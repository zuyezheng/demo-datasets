    "analysis": "The documents consist of a series of executive orders issued by President Harry S. Truman. A significant portion of these orders modify, amend, revoke, or extend previous executive orders. Several address national defense, including airspace reservations and control of facilities during labor disputes. Others deal with government administration, such as personnel compensation, property disposal, and interdepartmental committees. Some relate to foreign affairs, including patent protection abroad and mutual security programs. A few address specific issues like alley dwelling in D.C. and holiday closures for federal employees.",
