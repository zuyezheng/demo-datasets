    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the implementation and modification of regulations and boards established under the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. They cover a wide range of industries, including textiles, coal, oil, automobiles, restaurants, and construction. The documents also address labor disputes, fair competition, and the establishment of boards to oversee these issues. Some documents relate to the delegation of authority to various agencies and individuals to administer the NIRA. The sentiment is generally neutral, focusing on the practical aspects of implementing the NIRA and related legislation.",
