    "analysis": "The documents in this cluster primarily focus on the establishment, modification, or extension of Presidential advisory committees and commissions. These committees are formed to address a wide range of issues, from economic development and women's equality to ethical concerns, national security, and crime. The documents detail the committees' functions, membership, administrative support, and termination dates. A common theme is the use of the Federal Advisory Committee Act as the legal basis for these committees.",
