    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the establishment, modification, and alteration of land reservations for Native American tribes. They define boundaries, withdraw land from sale or settlement, and set aside land for the use and occupancy of specific tribes. Some documents also address the management and administration of these reservations, including the establishment of schools and other facilities. The documents reflect the historical relationship between the U.S. government and Native American tribes regarding land rights and resource allocation.",
