    "analysis": "The documents involve the transfer, reservation, or restoration of land, often between different government entities (War Department, Treasury Department, Interior Department, Agriculture Department, Housing and Home Finance Agency, Veterans Administration) or between the US government and territories/states (Hawaii, Puerto Rico, California, Canal Zone, Alaska). Many of the transfers involve land in Hawaii. Some documents specify the use of the land (military purposes, aeronautical purposes, agricultural experiment station, quarantine station, marine hospital, coast guard purposes, highway purposes, defense housing, naval petroleum reserve, scientific study). The documents frequently describe the land using metes and bounds, azimuths, and distances.",
