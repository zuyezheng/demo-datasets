    "analysis": "The documents primarily consist of executive orders, many of which are not published. The published orders focus on amendments and modifications to existing orders, particularly concerning energy policy, national security, and international economic powers. A recurring theme is the transfer of authority and responsibilities between different government entities and officials, especially within the Department of Energy. Some orders address specific countries like Iran and aim to protect national security by regulating information and communications technology. The sentiment is largely neutral, focusing on legal and administrative changes.",
