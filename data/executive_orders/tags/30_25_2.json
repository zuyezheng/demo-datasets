The documents specify the legal basis for the designation, often referencing treaties, acts of Congress, or other agreements that establish the United States' participation in these organizations. The purpose of these designations is to facilitate the organizations' operations within the United States by providing them with a status similar to that of foreign governments or diplomatic missions.",
