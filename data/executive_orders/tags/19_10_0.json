    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to exemptions from mandatory retirement for government employees. They cite the same legal authority (section 204 of the act of June 30, 1932) and follow a similar structure, beginning with \"Whereas, in my judgment, the public interest requires that...\" and then stating the exemption. The exemptions are usually for one year, though one is for six months and another is for an indefinite period. The documents span the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.",
