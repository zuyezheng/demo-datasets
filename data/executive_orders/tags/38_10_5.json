    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to the extension of trust periods for land allotments made to Native Americans. The purpose of these extensions is to restrict alienation of the land, preventing it from being sold or transferred. The documents specify different reservations, tribes, and individuals, and the extensions vary in length (1 year, 10 years, 25 years). Some documents list specific individuals and land offices, while others apply to entire reservations or tribes. The extensions are authorized by acts of Congress, primarily the act of February 8, 1887, and the act of June 21, 1906.",
