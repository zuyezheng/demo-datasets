    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern the establishment, modification, and revocation of land reservations for Native American tribes. They define specific geographical boundaries, often referencing natural landmarks like rivers and mountains, as well as surveyed lines and coordinates. The documents also address the inclusion or exclusion of existing settlements and land claims within these reservations. The overall sentiment is neutral, focusing on legal and administrative actions related to land management and Native American affairs.",
