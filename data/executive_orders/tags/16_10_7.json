    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to labor disputes that threaten to disrupt essential services, particularly in transportation (railroads, airlines, maritime) and also in industries related to national safety (atomic energy). The disputes have not been resolved through standard mediation processes, leading to the creation of boards of inquiry or emergency boards to investigate and provide recommendations.
