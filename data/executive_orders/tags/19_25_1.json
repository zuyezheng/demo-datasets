    "analysis": "The documents all pertain to exemptions from mandatory retirement for government employees. The exemptions are granted based on the judgment that the public interest requires the continued service of these individuals, who are reaching the age for automatic separation from service. The orders specify the individual's name, position, and the duration of the exemption, typically one year. The documents span the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter.",
