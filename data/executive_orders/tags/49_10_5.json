    "analysis": "The documents all concern the revocation of previous executive orders that had withdrawn public lands, followed by the opening of those lands for homesteading and desert land entry, specifically prioritizing ex-service men for a 91-day period after a resurvey. The documents consistently reference Public Resolution 85 of June 12, 1930, or Public Resolution No. 29 of February 14, 1920, as amended, which grants these preferences to veterans. The documents specify townships and ranges, and include language preventing land acquisition prior to the official restoration to general disposition.",
