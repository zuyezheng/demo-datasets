    "analysis": "The documents in this cluster primarily concern modifications and delegations of authority related to trade, tariffs, and economic regulations. Several documents address amendments to the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), adjusting tariff schedules and beneficiary developing countries. Other documents focus on export controls, oil import programs, and the imposition or adjustment of taxes on foreign investments. A common theme is the President's role in adjusting trade and economic policies to meet national interests, including national security and balance-of-payments objectives.",
