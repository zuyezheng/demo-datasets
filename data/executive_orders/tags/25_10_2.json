    "analysis": "The documents primarily concern land management and resource allocation, with a focus on establishing or modifying reservations (Native American, wildlife), national forests, and areas for specific uses like potash control, target ranges, or townsite purposes. Many orders involve the states of Arizona and New Mexico. They often specify land descriptions using the Gila and Salt River Meridian. The documents also reflect a concern for existing valid rights and claims.",
