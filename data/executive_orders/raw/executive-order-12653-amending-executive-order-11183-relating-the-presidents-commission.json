Extensions of appointments may be granted by the Commission at any time after appointments are made, but such extensions shall not exceed 90 days. White House Fellows will begin their appointments\". This Order is applicable to all Fellows with appointments commencing on or after September 1, 1987, and all such Fellows may be granted extensions of their original appointments so long as such extensions do not exceed 90 days.",
