    "date": "February 11, 1933",
    "content": [
        "Mr. Edward N. Dingley, jr., may be reinstated in an approved vacancy in the rating of associate radio engineer, Professional Service, grade 3, at the Naval Research Laboratory, Bellevue, D.C., without regard to the requirement of Reinstatement Rule IX as to length of prior service.",
        "In consideration of Mr. Dingley's experience in the duties involved and the fact that his qualifications so well fit him for the position, it is believed that the best interests of the Government would be served by his reinstatement. Mr. Dingley, from his entrance into the service November 23, 1926, to the present time, has been almost continuously engaged in work tending to increase his professional value to the department, and but for the fact that a part of this service was rendered in research work under large commercial organizations instead of the Government, would have been technically eligible for reinstatement by reason of length of service.",
        "This order is issued on recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy, and the Civil Service Commission concurs in recommending it.",
        "HERBERT HOOVER",
        "The White House,February 11, 1933."
