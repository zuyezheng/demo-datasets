        "(3) A perpetual easement and right of way, consisting of the right to construct, operate, maintain, repair, rebuild and replace an existing electric power distribution line on, over, across, and under a strip of land of necessary width to insure safe operation of the electric power distribution line, the center line of the said strip being described as follows: Beginning at a point in the east boundary of Tract No. 37 and in the center line of the existing electric power distribution line at or near a 20-inch chestnut oak tree at a fence angle, and said point being N. 11* 02' E., approximately 410 feet from a chestnut stump at the most southeasterly corner of Tract No. 37; thence in a general westerly direction approximately 2,650 feet to a point where the center line crosses the southwest boundary of Tract No. 38; together with the right to clear said strip and keep it cleared, and the right to install and maintain anchors and to cut and remove danger trees outside said strip.",
