Where the provisions of any such expiring contracts include extensions or renewals thereof by arbitration or otherwise, such provisions may have the same force and effect as other provisions of such contracts, but in the process of extension or renewal of any such contracts, as provided by their terms and conditions, no working hours shall be set up which are in excess of the maximum allowed in this Code, and the minimum wage provisions shall not be less than those provided in this Code.",
