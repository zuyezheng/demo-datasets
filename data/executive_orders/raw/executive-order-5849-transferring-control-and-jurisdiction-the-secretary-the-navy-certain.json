        "The directions of the lines refer to the true meridian and were determined from deflection angles from known azimuths of the Canal Zone triangulation system. The magnetic declination was not recorded. The survey was made January 6 to 15, 1932, by The Panama Canal. The parcel of land is shown on Panama Canal Drawing X-6102-22, on file in the office of the Governor of the Panama Canal and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy.",
