    "date": "April 27, 1915",
    "content": [
        "It is hereby ordered that the portion of the Panama Canal through the continental divide heretofore known as \"Culebra Cut\" shall hereafter be named \"Gaillard Cut\" in honor of the late Lieutenant-Colonel D. D. Gaillard, Corps of Engineers, United States Army.",
        "As a member of the Isthmian Canal Commission from March 16, 1907, to December 5, 1913, Lieutenant-Colonel Gaillard was in charge of the work in Culebra Cut until its virtual completion, being compelled to abandon his duties in July, 1913, through an illness which culminated in his death on December 5, 1913. His period of Panama Canal service included the years of most active construction work. He brought to the service trained ability of the highest class, untiring zeal and unswerving devotion to duty.",
        "I deem it a fitting recognition of Lieutenant-Colonel Gaillard's service to the country to re-name in his honor the scene of his life's triumph.",
        "WOODROW WILSON\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nApril 27, 1915."
