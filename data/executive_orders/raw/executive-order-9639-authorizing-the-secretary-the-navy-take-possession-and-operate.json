        "WHEREAS after investigation I find and proclaim that there are interruptions in the operation of the plants and facilities used in the transportation, refining, and processing of petroleum and petroleum products designated in the list attached hereto and made a part hereof, as a result of existing and threatened strikes and other labor disturbances; that the war effort will be unduly impeded or delayed by such interruptions; and that the exercise, as hereinafter specified, of the powers vested in me is necessary to insure, in the interest of the war effort, the operation of these plants and facilities used in the transportation, refining, and processing of petroleum and petroleum products designated in the list attached hereto and made a part hereof;",
        "NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including Section 9 of the Selective Service Act of 1940 (54 Stat. 892) as amended by the War Labor Disputes Act (57 Stat. 163), as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:",

        "2. In furtherance of the purposes of this order, the Secretary of the Navy is authorized to select and hire such employees and agents as he deems necessary and suitable to carry out the provisions of this order; to exercise any contractual or other rights of the owners of said plants, facilities, and property incident to the operation of said plants, facilities, and property or the production, sale, and distribution of the products and services thereof; to do any and all other things that he may deem necessary or desirable for, or incidental to, the use and operation of said plants, facilities, and property, or the production, sale, and distribution of the products and services thereof; and to take any other steps that he deems necessary to carry out the provisions and purposes of this order.",
        "3. The Secretary of the Navy shall operate the plants, facilities, and property mentioned herein pursuant to the provisions of the War Labor Disputes Act and under the terms and conditions of employment which are lawfully in effect at the time possession of such plants, facilities, and property is taken under this order, subject to the provisions of Section 5 of the War Labor Disputes Act.",
        "4. The Secretary of the Navy shall permit, upon such terms and conditions as he deems advisable, the management of the plants, facilities, and property taken under this order to continue its managerial functions to the extent consistent with the purposes of this order.",

The Secretary of the Navy is authorized to take such action, if any, as he may deem necessary or desirable to provide protection for, and prevent interference with, the plants, facilities, and property taken under this order and all persons employed or seeking employment therein, their families and homes, and he is further authorized to take such appropriate disciplinary action, not inconsistent with law, as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this order. Upon the request of the Secretary of the Navy or his duly authorized representative, the Department of Justice, through the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall immediately undertake and conduct an investigation of any matter affecting the operation of said plants, facilities, and property or government possession thereof hereunder.",

All Federal agencies, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the National Labor Relations Board, the Department of Labor, Department of the Interior, the National Selective Service System, and the Office of Price Administration, shall cooperate with the Secretary of the Navy to the fullest extent of their authority in carrying out the purposes of this order.",
        "7. Possession, control and operation of any plant, facility, or property, or portion thereof, of which possession is taken under this order shall be terminated by the Secretary of the navy as soon as practicable, but in no event more than sixty days after he determines that the productive efficiency of the plant, facility, or property, or portion thereof, prevailing prior to the existing interruptions referred to in the recitals of this order has been restored.",
