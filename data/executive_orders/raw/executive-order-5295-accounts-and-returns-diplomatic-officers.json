        "XX-1. By whom accounts should be rendered",
        "At missions where there are special disbursing officers, the accounts of the missions will be rendered by those officers. Accounts current of special disbursing officers will be approved by the respective chiefs of mission.",
        "At missions where there are no special disbursing officers, the accounts of the missions will be rendered by the chiefs of mission. Foreign Service officers at such missions will render their own accounts for salaries, and for any expenditures made by them under instructions of the Department of State.",
        "XX-2. Accounts to be rendered monthly",
        "All accounts will be rendered at the end of each calendar month according to the following form, \"Month ending --- (Last day of month) ---,\" except that accounts rendered for periods of less than a full month by a diplomatic officer surrendering charge temporarily or submitting final accounts will be submitted as follows: \"Partial month --- (Date) --- to --- (Date) ---, inclusive.\" All accounts will be mailed or otherwise sent to the Department of State in Washington as soon as possible after the close of the accounting period to which they relate, in no case to exceed ten days. (28 Stat. 209; U.S.C. title 31, sec. 78.)",
        "XX-3. Disbursements",
        "All disbursements, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, will be included in a return (Standard Form No. 1025), to be transmitted by the chief of mission, with the account current (Form No. 191-Diplomatic) to the Department of State, at the end of the accounting period to which it relates.",
        "All disbursements made by special disbursing officers at missions will be included in returns (Form No. 294), to be transmitted by them, with Standard Form No. 1021 or No. 1022, through the respective chiefs of mission to the Department of State, at the end of the accounting period to which they relate.",
        "XX-4. General account current",
        "The accounts for each period prescribed in Chapter XX-2 will be stated on Form No. 191-Diplomatic, if rendered by the chief of mission, and on Standard Form No. 1021 or 1022 if rendered by a special disbursing officer.",
        "XX-5. General accounts",
        "Diplomatic officers are required to keep separate general accounts of all public or other moneys coming into their possession in their official capacity from any source and for any purpose whatever and to render accounts of the same, in such manner, on such forms, and at such times as may be prescribed by the Comptroller General of the United States or the Department of State.",
        "Diplomatic officers will keep a general cash book and such other account books as may be required according to the needs of their missions, to show all details of receipts and expenditures, to ensure accuracy and to enable responsible officers to exercise complete control over the funds of the missions.",
        "XX-6. Special accounts",
        "Any account for any purpose opened by request of any department or establishment of the Government will be kept separately, and a separate return will be made thereof for transmission by the Department of State to the interested department or establishment. Request for the opening of any such account will be made through the Department of State. Expenses incurred for any other department or establishment of the Government will not be included in any account against the Department of State unless specifically authorized. The amount of such expenses will be taken up in the regular account current at the periods prescribed in Chapter XX-2 under the appropriation or fund from which payment is made and on the line indicated in the account current.",
        "Expenditures made in connection with other special accounts, against which separate drafts are drawn, will be taken up in a separate account current and will not be included in the regular accounts of the missions.",
        "In no case will a separate account be rendered, or a separate draft drawn, unless specifically authorized by the Department of State.",
        "XX-7. Accounts not to cover different fiscal years",
        "No account, except for travel, may embrace time or transactions belonging to different fiscal years. Appropriations and adjustments are confined to the fiscal years ending June 30, and when an expenditure for any purpose, except for travel, extends from one fiscal year into another, two accounts will be rendered.",
        "XX-8. Accounts to be stated in currency of the United States",
        "All accounts of diplomatic officers will be stated in the currency of the United States; and all drafts on the Secretary of State will be drawn in the money of the United States, not in the foreign money of the officers' accounts. In all cases where the disbursements are actually made in foreign currency the vouchers themselves should be taken and rendered in the same currency in which the disbursements are made. Satisfactory evidence should accompany the account as to the correct valuation of the foreign currency in currency of the United States in the form of a certificate of a responsible banker or of a diplomatic officer based on authentic quotations.",

        "At missions where there are no disbursing officers (second paragraph of XX-1), diplomatic officers will obtain funds for salaries, as well as for contingent and other expenses, by drafts on the Secretary of State, drawn at five days after sight. Such drafts will show, on the lines indicated thereon, whether for salary, contingent expenses, clerk hire, et cetera, and the accounting period covered.

        "If the account includes or covers a period during which a charg\u00e9 d'affaires ad interim was the principal officer, he will sign the appropriate certificate on the form mentioned, showing the period that he was in charge of the mission and including the required statement as to his absence.",
        "XX-10. Telegraph charges",

        "XX-12. Settlement of final account",
        "The Comptroller General of the United States disapproves the procedure of officers drawing drafts for settlement of final accounts.

        "XX-13. Duplicate accounts to be transmitted",
        "All accounts will be transmitted to the Secretary of State in duplicate.",

        "Whoever, being charged with the payment of any appropriation made by Congress, pays to any clerk or other employee of the United States a sum less than that provided by law and requires such employee to receipt or give a voucher for an amount greater than actually paid to and received by him, is guilty of embezzlement, and shall be fined in double the amount so withheld from any employee of the Government, and imprisoned not more than two years. (35 Stat. 1105; U.S.C. title 18, sec. 172.)",
        "Other sections of the Criminal Code prohibit under penalty of fine and imprisonment the fraudulent execution, possession, transmission, or submission to the Government of the United States, or any officer thereof, of any false document for the purpose of defrauding the United States.

        "Envelopes are an exception and may not be purchased in the open market. (Comp. Gen. No. A-15999 February 24, 1927.)",
        "XX-19. Vouchers required",
        "A proper voucher will be furnished for every disbursement. Each voucher will show on its face the kind of currency in which paid, and if paid in foreign currency it will show the amount reduced to its equivalent in the standard currency of the United States and the rate at which the reduction is made. Vouchers will be in the English language or accompanied by a translation. They will show exactly for what the disbursement was made, and will be numbered in the order in which paid, and referred to in the corresponding account (Form No. 1025) by number.

        "An officer of the Government can not be relieved of his liability for fees or other public moneys in his possession deposited with banks or bankers, unless such deposits are made in depositories designated by the Department of State. All deposits except in such depositories are made at his own risk; and in case of loss by failure of the bank, or otherwise, the responsible officer will be held accountable for the amount lost.",

        "Drafts will show in the right-hand margins the purpose for which drawn, and the appropriation to which the amount is chargeable. Drafts will not be drawn for one purpose and the proceeds used for another. Drafts for expenses authorized by special instruction will refer explicitly to the number, date, and file number of the instruction. The same reference will appear in the corresponding account.",
