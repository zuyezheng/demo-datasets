The Governor may from time to time reduce or increase, within the limits prescribed by the said act, the amount of relief granted to a beneficiary, if the economic status of the beneficiary in the opinion of the Governor justifies or warrants such an adjustment of the amount of cash relief, consideration being given to such factors as the earnings or income of the beneficiary, if any, the number of persons dependent upon him for support, and the ability of his family to assist in providing for him.",
