        "(b) An employee shall not be advanced unless his current efficiency is good or better than good. The term \"good\" shall have the meaning attributed to it in the system of efficiency rating approved by the Civil Service Commission for the agency concerned, and each agency affected by this order shall maintain such a system.",

All actions under this section and the reasons therefor shall be reported to the Civil Service Commission. The Commission shall consolidate the information so received and transmit it to Congress.",
