        "WHEREAS it now appears from drilling operations that it is unlikely that oil or gas can be obtained in commercial quantities from the shallow zone underlying the town site of Ford, within the said Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 2, and that the interests of the United States in the soil and gas in the deeper and unexplored formations underlying such town site may be adequately protected with fewer drill sites than have been heretofore reserved; and",
