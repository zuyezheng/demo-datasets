        "By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Civil Service Act (22 Stat. 403:",
        "5 U.S.C. 633), and by section 1753 of the Revised Statutes (5 U.S.C. 631), and pursuant to the recommendation of the Secretary of State, the Civil Service Commission is hereby authorized to confer a competitive status upon Miss Winifred R. Donnellon, an employee of the United States Passport Agency, Department of State, without regard to the competitive provisions of the Civil Service Rules",

If Miss Donnellon had remained in the position in the Department of State from which she was transferred in 1945 at the convenience of the Department, she would have become eligible in 1946 to acquire a competitive status under noncompetitive procedures of the Civil Service Commission.",
