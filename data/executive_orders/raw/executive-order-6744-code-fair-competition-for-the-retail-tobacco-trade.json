        "\"(b): When the Administrator shall have fixed a basis for determining minimum prices for the said products or said specified patt thereof for a stated period, which prices shall be reasonably calculated to correct the conditions of such emergency and to effectuate the purposes of the Act, he shall publish the said basis. Thereafter, during such stated period, no member of the trade shall sell such products at a net realized price below the minimum price determined upon the basis so fixed, and any such sale shall be deemed destructive price cutting.
