        "Mrs. Cecil Alexander may be appointed to an appropriate position in the Post Office Department or the field service thereof without regard to the requirements of the civil-service rules.",
        "Mrs. Alexander, who is employed as contact clerk in the office of the postmaster at Dallas, Tex., and who has performed very efficient service as such since February 18, 1930, is now past the maximum age for admission to competitive examination. It is represented, because of her peculiar qualifications and ability to handle the public due to her extended experience in the business world in confidential and responsible positions prior to her temporary appointment in the Dallas office, that the Postal Service will suffer materially by the discontinuance of the services of Mrs. Alexander and it is not possible through regular channels to replace her with a new appointee possessing like ability, tact, and proficiency required of this position.",
        "This order is issued upon the recommendation of the Postmaster General.",
        "HERBERT HOOVER",
