        "By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution of the United States of America and by Section 126b(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2155), as amended by Section 304(a) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95242, 92 Stat. 131), and having determined that withholding the export proposed pursuant to Nuclear Regulatory Commission export license application XSNM-1060 would be seriously prejudicial to the achievement of the United States nonproliferation objectives, that export to India is authorized; however, such export shall not occur for a period of 60 days as defined by Section 130g of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.",
