        "WHEREAS disputes exist between the Akron & Barberton Belt Railroad and other carriers represented by the Eastern, Western, and Southeastern Carriers' Conference Committees, designated in List A attached hereto and made a part hereof, and certain of their employees represented by eleven cooperating (nonoperating) railway labor organizations, designated in List B attached hereto and made a part hereof, on the subject of improvements in vacation and holiday rules, and the carriers' counter proposals; and",
        "WHEREAS disputes exist between the Akron & Barberton Belt Railroad and other carriers represented by the Eastern, Western, and Southeastern Carriers' Conference Committees, designated in List C attached hereto and made a part hereof, and certain of their employees represented by eleven cooperating (non-operating) railway labor organizations, designated in List D attached hereto and made a part hereof, on the subject of improvements in health and welfare plan, group life insurance, inclusion of cost-of-living adjustments in basic wage rates, and a general wage rate increase of twenty-five cents per hour, and the carriers' counter proposals; and",
        "WHEREAS these disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended; and",
        "WHEREAS these disputes, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, threaten substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive the country of essential transportation service:",
        "NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 160), I hereby create a board of three members, to be appointed by me, to investigate these disputes. No member of the board shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any carrier.",
