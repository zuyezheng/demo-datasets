    "content": [
        "Mr. Joseph B. White may be appointed to an appropriate position in the classified service without regard to the requirements of the civil service rules.",
        "This order is recommended by the Secretary of War, who states that Mr. White, a veteran of the Spanish and World Wars, was a civilian employee of the United States military government in Cuba from 1898 to 1901, serving under General Wood, General Harbord, and General Andrews, whose letters bear witness that Mr. White's faithful and efficient services would have brought him within the operation of the Executive Order of July 3, 1902, permitting appointment to positions in the classified civil service of persons in the employ of the United States in the military government of Cuba, had his employment continued a few months longer.",
        "Mr. White passed an examination given by the Civil Service Commission in 1924 for the position of business executive in the Veterans' Bureau but was not appointed to that position. In view of the conditions of Mr. White's employment in Cuba and his failure on account of illness to receive classification under the Executive Order of July 3, 1902, the Civil Service Commission submits the case without prejudice.",
        "HERBERT HOOVER",
        "The White House,May 27, 1929."
