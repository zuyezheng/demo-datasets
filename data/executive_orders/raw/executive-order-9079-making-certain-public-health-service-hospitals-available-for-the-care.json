The Federal Security Administrator is authorized to admit, to the extent that he may deem desirable, insane persons (except those from the District of Columbia) to the Public Health Service Hospitals at Lexington, Kentucky, and Fort Worth, Texas, for care and treatment upon the same terms and conditions as such persons may be entitled to admission to St. Elizabeth's Hospital, at Washington, D. C.",

All sums so paid shall be deposited in the United States Treasury to the credit of the appropriation made for the care and maintenance of patients at St. Elizabeth's Hospital.",
