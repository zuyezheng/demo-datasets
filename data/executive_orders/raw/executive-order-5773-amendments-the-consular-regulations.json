        "8. United States attorneys, on urgent cases in connection with pending trials.",
        "149. Duties toward American citizens. The powers and duties of consular officers in respect to American citizens depend in a great measure upon the municipal law of the United States. No civil or criminal jurisdiction can be exercised by them over their countrymen without express authority of law or by treaty stipulation with the State in which they reside. Consular officers are particularly cautioned not to enter into any contentions that can be avoided, either with their countrymen or with the authorities or nationals of the country. They should use every endeavor to settle in an amicable manner all disputes in which their countrymen may be concerned, but they should take no part in litigation between citizens. Consular officers should countenance and protect American citizens before the authorities of the country in all cases in which, they may be injured or oppressed; but at the same time they should impress upon such citizens their obligation to respect the laws of the country where they may be residing or traveling. It is the duty of consular officers to endeavor on all occasions to maintain and promote all the rightful interests of American citizens, and to protect them in all privileges that are provided for by treaty or are conceded by usage. If representations are made to the local authorities and fail to secure the proper redress, the case should be reported to the diplomatic mission and to the Department of State.",
        "448. To be returned to local post office. All letters addressed in the care of a consular office should be held at the disposal of the addressees for the period prescribed by the laws of the country in which the consular office is situated. If unclaimed within such period, they should be redelivered, unopened and with stamps intact, to the local post office from which they were received, in order that they may be returned to the country of origin in pursuance of the provisions of the Universal Postal Convention. Consular officers will not return unclaimed letters by masters of vessels.",
