        "Whereas  there exists among the several executive departments and agencies a need for a more adequate source of information with respect to patent rights and interests owned or controlled by the United States Government; and",
        "Whereas  the establishment in the United States Patent Office, Department of Commerce, of a separate register for the recording of such patent rights and interests would meet this need and would be in the public interest:",

The register shall be open to inspection except as to such entries or documents which, in the opinion of the department or agency submitting them for recording, should be maintained in secrecy: Provided, however, That the right of inspection may be restricted to authorized representatives of the Government pending the final report to the President by the National Patent Planning Commission under Executive Order No. 8977 of December 12, 1941, and action thereon by the President.",
