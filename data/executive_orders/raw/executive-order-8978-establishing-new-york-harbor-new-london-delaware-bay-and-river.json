Advance arrangements for entry into or navigation through or within a Defensive Sea Area must be made; preferably by application at a United States Naval District Headquarters in advance of sailing, or by radio or visual communication on approaching the seaward limits of the area. If radio telegraphy is used, the call \"NQO\" shall be made on a frequency of 500 Kes, and permission to enter the port requested. The name of the vessel, purpose of entry and name of master must be given In the request. If visual communications are used, the procedure shall be essentially the same.",
