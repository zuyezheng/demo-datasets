    "content": [
        "By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by the provisions of the last sentence of the eighth paragraph of subdivision second of section 2 of the Civil Service Act of January 16, 1883 (ch. 27, 22 Stat. 403, 404), it is hereby ordered that Dr. John Bruce Arnold may be appointed as acting assistant surgeon, United States Public Health Service, Treasury Department, without compliance with the requirements of civil-service rule II.",
        "Dr. Arnold has been continuously on duty abroad with the Public Health Service since February 1, 1921, and was therefore exempt from civil-service requirements. Due to recent curtailment of force, Dr. Arnold was transferred to a similar position in the United States requiring civil-service eligibility. Ilis services can be used to advantage on account of his experience.",
        "This order is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury.",
