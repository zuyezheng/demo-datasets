        "Whoever, being charged with the payment of any appropriation made by Congress, pays to any clerk or other employee of the United States a sum less than that provided by law, and requires such employee to receipt or give a voucher for an amount greater than that actually paid to and received by him, is guilty of embezzlement, and shall be fined in double the amount so withheld from any employee of the Government and imprisoned not more than two years. (35 Stat. L. 1105; U.S.C. title 18, sec. 172.)",

(35 Stat. L. 1094, 1095; U.S.C. title 18, secs. 72-75.)",

        "The account must be supported by proper vouchers for all expenditures, and must be signed, sealed, and properly indorsed. Each case must stand by itself and show all fees and fines assessed and collected, and all disbursements made.

The balance after deducting the disbursements may be turned into the Treasury by being charged against the officer in his account current (Form No. 222) for the accounting period as \"Balance from the consular court account for the fiscal year ending June 30, __,\" but such action must be accurately noted in the consular court return. If fees are insuficient to pay expenses, the balance is payable from the contingent expense appropriation.",
        "All fees collected under the consular court regulations, all fines, and all disbursements from the consular court fund, must be entered in a separate court record and are not to be inscribed in the Record of Fees, nor are they to be included in the transcripts of such book sent to the Department of State.",
        "As the law prescribing the use of fee stamps refers only to consular and notarial acts, and not to judicial services, fee stamps are not to be used for services performed under the laws and regulations governing the consular courts.",

All consular officers, including consular agents, will make a return (Form No. 101, 101a) to the Department of State of all fees received by them, of whatsoever kind, except as otherwise provided in Article XXVII of these Regulations, during each of the accounting periods prescribed in paragraph 536, to which such fees relate.",
        "If no fees have been received that fact must be stated on the return. Each return must be signed by the officer in charge and sworn to before some person authorized to administer oaths.",

        "When a consul general who is also diplomatic agent or minister resident shall have occasion to credit consular fees, it should be done in his account as prescribed above.",
        "No authority can be given to a consular officer under which he can be relieved of his liability for fees or other public moneys in his possession deposited with banks or bankers, unless such deposits are made in Government depositories designated by the department. All such deposits are made at his own risk; and in the event of loss by failure of the bank, or otherwise, the consular officer must make it good, and the sureties on his official bond are liable for such loss.",
