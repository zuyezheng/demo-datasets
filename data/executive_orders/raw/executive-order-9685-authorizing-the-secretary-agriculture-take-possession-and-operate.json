        "WHEREAS after investigation I find and proclaim that as a result of existing and threatened strikes and other labor disturbances there are interruptions in the operation of plants and facilities used in the production, processing, transportation, sale or distribution of livestock, meat, meat products and by-products (including but not limited to those plants and facilities designated in the attached list); that the war effort will be unduly impeded or delayed by such interruptions; and that the exercise, as hereinafter specified, of the powers vested in me is necessary to insure, in the interest of the war effort, the operation of each of these plants and facilities:",
        "NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including Section 9 of the Selective Service Act of 1940 (54 Stat. 892) as amended by the War Labor Disputes Act (57 Stat. 163), as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:",
        "1. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized and directed to take possession of the plants and facilities described in the first paragraph of this order where there is any such interruption (including but not limited to those plants and facilities designated in the attached list), or such part or parts of each of such plants and facilities as he deems necessary, and to the extent he may deem necessary; to take possession of any real or personal property and other assets, wherever situated, used in connection with the operation of such plants and facilities; and to operate or to arrange for the use and operation of such plants and facilities in any manner that he deems necessary in the interest of the war effort.",
        "2. In furtherance of the purposes of this order, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to select and hire such employees and agents as he deems necessary and suitable to carry out the provisions of this order; to exercise any contractual or other rights of the owners of said plants, facilities, and property or the production, processing, transportation, sale, or distribution of the products and services thereof; to do any and all other things that he may deem necessary or desirable for, or incidental to, the use and operation of said plants, facilities, and property, or the production, processing, transportation, sale, or distribution of the products and services thereof; and to take any other steps that he deems necessary to carry out the provisions and purposes of this order.",
        "3. The Secretary of Agriculture shall operate the plants, facilities, and property mentioned herein under the terms and conditions of employment lawfully in effect at the time possession of such plants, facilities, and property is taken under this order, until and unless the duly authorized federal agencies shall, with the approval of the President, otherwise direct.",
        "4. The Secretary of Agriculture may permit, upon such terms and conditions as he deems advisable, the management of the plants, facilities, and property taken under this order to continue its managerial functions to the extent consistent with the purposes of this order.",
        "5. The Secretary of Agriculture may request the Secretary of War to furnish protection for, and prevent interference with, the plants, facilities, and property taken under this order and all persons employed or seeking employment therein, their families and their homes, and to furnish equipment, manpower, and other facilities or services deemed necessary by the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out the provisions and accomplish the purposes of this order; and the Secretary of War is authorized and directed upon such request to take such action as may be necessary to furnish such protection, equipment, manpower, or other facilities or services.",
        "6. In carrying out this order the Secretary of Agriculture may act through or with the aid of such public or private instrumentalities, persons, or corporations as he may designate. All Federal agencies, including but not limited to the Treasury Department, Navy Department, Department of Justice, Department of Labor, and the Office of Price Administration, shall cooperate with the Secretary of Agriculture to the fullest extent of their authority in carrying out the purposes of this order.",
        "7. Possession, control, and operation of any plant, facility, or property, or portion thereof, of which possession is taken under this order shall be terminated by the Secretary of Agriculture as soon as practicable, but in no event more than sixty days after he determines that the productive efficiency of the plant, facility, or property, or portion thereof, prevailing prior to the existing interruptions referred to in the recitals of this order has been restored.",
        "8. This order shall become effective immediately except that possession of any plant or facility shall not be made effective before 12:01 A. M., January 26, 1946.",
