An accurate record of the efficiency of all officers and employees of the Department of State is kept for this purpose.

All such information is appraised at least once in two years; and the result of such appraisal expressed in terms of \"excellent,\" \"very good,\" \"satisfactory,\" or \"unsatisfactory,\" accompanied by a concise statement of the considerations upon which these terms are based, is entered upon records to be known as the efficiency records of the officers, and constitutes their efficiency ratings for the period. No charges against an officer that would adversely affect his efficiency rating or his value to the service, if true, are taken into consideration in determining his efficiency rating except after the officer shall have had opportunity to reply thereto. The Assistant Secretary of State supervising the Division of Foreign Service Personnel is responsible for the keeping of accurate and impartial efficiency records of Foreign Service officers and for taking all measures necessary to insure their accuracy and impartiality. Not later than November 1 at least every two years, the Division of Foreign Service Personnel, under the supervision of the Assistant Secretary of State, prepares a list in which all Foreign Service officers are graded in accordance with their relative efficiency and value to the service. In this list officers are graded as excellent, very good, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory, with such further subclassification as may be found necessary. AU officers rated satisfactory or above are eligible for promotion in the order of merit to the minimum salary of the next higher class. This list does not become effective in so far as it affects promotion until it has been considered by the Board of Foreign Service Personnel hereinbefore provided for, and approved by the Secretary of State.

Recommendations are also made, in order of merit, as shown by ratings in the examinations for appointment to the unclassified grade, with commissions also as diplomatic secretaries and vice consuls, of those who have successfully passed the examinations. All such recommendations are submitted to the Secretary of State for his consideration and, if he shall approve, for transmission to the President.",

The former are Foreign Service officers commissioned by the President as vice consuls; the latter are commissioned by the Secretary of State as occasion may require, usually from among the clerks at consular offices, and receive compensation as clerks and not as vice consuls.",
        "All vice consuls are consular officers subordinate to principal consular officers (consuls general and consuls), exercising and performing the duties within the limits of their consulates at the same, or at different, points and places from those at which the principals are located. (38 Stat. L. 806; U.S.C. title 22, sec. 51; 33 Fed. Rep. 167.)",
        "Vice consuls, whether of career or not, perform such duties of the consular offices to which they may be assigned as are described in the Consular Regulations and laws of the United States, and which they may be directed to perform by the principal officer under whom they serve. When the principal officer is absent, the ranking consular officer, or, if there be two of equal grade, the one whose commission at the post bears the earlier date, in the absence of contrary instructions from the Department of State, will assume full charge of the office under his bond.",
        "22. Vice consuls not of career. Vice consuls not of career are not eligible to appointment as Foreign Service officers without undergoing the prescribed examination and qualifying therefor, but such vice consuls who are clerks in the Foreign Service are eligible to advancement in accordance with section 24. They are appointed to particular posts and receive certificates of appointment to those posts, which are forwarded to them through the appropriate diplomatic missions.",
        "Citizenship. Every vice consul must be an American citizen. (40 Stat. L. 1333;)",
        "Removal of vice consuls. Consuls general and consuls have no power to remove vice consuls assigned to their offices or to service under their supervision. In cases of serious insubordination, threatened destruction or loss of Government property, or conduct likely to injure the reputation of the consulate, the principal consular officer may order the vice consul responsible therefor to perform no official duties pending a review of the facts by the Secretary of State. Forinal suspensions can be made Only upon prior authorization by the Secretary of State, but such Authorization may be requested by telegram whenever an emergency is deemed to exist. A report of the facts, accompanied by a signed statement of the vice consul in his own behalf, will be forwarded by the most expeditious method.",
        "23. Consular agents. Consular agents are appointed by the Secretary of State, usually upon the nomination of the principal consular officer. The practice of making such nominations must not be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary of State to appoint these officers without such previous nomination by the principal officer.",
        "The term \"consular agents\" denotes consular officers subordinate to principal Officers exercising the powers vested in them and performing the duties prescribed for them by regulation of the President, at posts or places different from those at which such principals are located. (38 Stat. L. 806; U.S.C. title 22, sec. 51.) Their functions are not, in all respects, as extensive as those of the principal officer. Though they act at places different from the seat of the principal office and their duties are in substance the same toward persons desiring consular services, they act only as the representative of the principal, and are subject and subordinate to him. They are not authorized to correspond with the Department of State, unless through the principal or under exceptional circumstances; they make no returns or reports directly to the department, and they are not permitted to render accounts or make any drafts for expenditures on the departments of the Government unless under express instructions.",
        "Consular agents are subject, like other consular officers, to the provisions of law and the instructions of the Department of State. As soon as a consular agent has entered upon his duties, a specimen of his signature and an impression of his official seal should be sent to the department.",
        "Citizenship of consular agents. In all cases where it is practicable, consular agents should be citizens of the United States, and none other should be recommended for appointment unless citizens of proper character and standing can not be found.",
        "Acting consular agents. No consular agent has authority to appoint a subagent. In case of emergency, or in the absence of the consular agent on leave, the principal consular officer may designate, with the approval of the Department Of State, a suitable person to perform the duties under the title of \"acting consular agent.\" The principal consular officer should, at the time the change is made, repdrt to the department the name of the person whom he has designated as acting consular agent during the temporary absence of the agent from his post, and should accompany the report with the signature of the substitute and an impression of the official seal of the agency.",
        "A person placed temporarily in charge of a consular agency should sign aS acting consular agent. Acting consular agents must hot perform notariAl Acts.",
        "24. Clerks at consulates. Clerks at consulates are, so far as practicable, appointed Wilder civil-service rules and regulations. (43 Stat. L. 1017; U.S.C. title 22, sec. 56.) They are frequently nominated by the consuls, but their appointment is subject to approval by the Secretary of State, and the department may fill such clerkships directly by appointment from the United States or from American citizens abroad. In nominating persons for clerkships, consuls must give the qualifications of the nominees in the form prescribed by the department, together with the proposed amount of compensation of each clerk and the allowance from which paid. No clerk shall receive increased compensation without the authority of the Secretary of State. All consular clerks shall be clerks in the Foreign Service of the United States of America and shall be graded and classified in the following manner:",
        "Clerks in the Foreign Service of the United States of America shall receive, Within the limitation Of such appropriations as the Congress may make, the basic Compensations specified below:",

        "Junior clerks. Class 1, $2,750; class 2, $2,500; class 3, all clerks whose compensation as fixed by the Secretary of State is less than $2,500 per annum.",
        "Appointments to the grade of senior clerk and advancement from class to class in that grade shall hereafter be by promotion for efficient service; and no one shall be promoted to the grade of senior clerk who is not an American citizen and has not served as a clerk in a diplomatic mission or a consulate, or both, or as a clerk in the Department of State for at least five years.",
        "The Secretary of State is authorized, at posts where in his judgment it is required by the public interests for the purpose of meeting the unusual or excessive costs of living ascertained by him to exist, to grant compensation to clerks assigned there in addition to the basic rates herein specified, within such appropriations as Congress may make for such purpose.",
        "No clerk who is not an American citizen shall hereafter be appointed to serve in a diplomatic mission. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, secs. 1-4.)",
        "Citizenship of clerks. Preference shall be given to American citizens in nominations for clerkships whenever properly qualified persons can be found.",
        "Oath of office. All American clerks are required to take an oath of office.",
        "Members of consular officer's family. The appointment of members of a consular officer's family in his office will be permitted only in exceptional cases where the expediency of such an appointment and the qualifications of the applicant are clearly shown.",
        "Changes in clerical personnel. Consular officers must report promptly to the department every change in the clerical personnel of their offices.",
        "Efficiency reports and records. The department maintains a system of efficiency reports and records applying to clerks, messengers, and other noncareer subordinates including consular agents, which shall be the basis of promotion.",
        "Confidential nature of reports and recommendations. The efficiency records of clerks and other subordinates are strictly confidential, and no efficiency report or rating is to be divulged by any consular officer except to Foreign Service inspectors and supervising consuls general, or persons specially authorized by the department.",
        "Clerks commissioned as vice consuls. A clerk at a consulate will be commissioned as vice consul only when conditions at the post make an additional signing officer necessary.",
        "25. Prohibition against engaging in business. No consular officer whose salary exceeds $1,000 a year shall, while he holds his office, be interested in or transact any business as a merchant, factor, broker, or other trader, or as a clerk or other agent for any such person to, from, or within the port, place, or limits of his jurisdiction, directly or indirectly, either in his own name or in the name or through the agency of any other person; nor shall he practice as a lawyer for compensation or be interested in the fees or compensation of any lawyer; and he shall in his official bond stipulate as a condition thereof not to violate this prohibition. (34 Stat. L. 101; U.S.C. title 22, secs. 106, 107, 108.)",
        "No consular officer whose salary exceeds $1,000 per annum shall make any investments of money within the limits of the country from the government of which he has received his recognition or exequatur. This prohibition applies to the owning of real estate, or of bonds, shares, stocks, mortgages, etc. There is no objection to a consular officer's depositing money in a bank which happens to give interest on current accounts or fixed deposits; and a consular officer may buy a house and land for his own use, but he may not do so as an investment or speculation.",
        "26. Jurisdiction of consuls general. All consuls general are charged with the ordinary duties of a consul within the prescribed limits of their respective districts.",
        "27. Limits of consular districts. The statute authorizes the President to define the extent of country to be embraced within any consulate, (R.S. 1695; U.S.C. title 22, sec. 55.) The consular commission usually describes these limits as including all places nearer to the official residence of a consul than to the residence of any other consul within the same allegiance. This is to be regarded as the rule by which the limits of the respective districts are to be determined in the absence of instructions specifically defining the consular district. In no case, however, is a consular officer authorized, except under special authorization from the Department of State, to take jurisdiction of consular business outside of the State from the government of which he receives his exequatur. The Department of State may, however, in its discretion, provide that a consular agency shall conduct its business under the supervision of a consular office in the same country without regard to nearness of geographical situation. The limits of a consular agency are always within the district of the consulate to which it is attached, unless the department shall determine otherwise.",
        "28. Neglect of duty or misconduct. Whenever any consular officer willfully neglects or omits to perform seasonably any duty imposed upon him by law, or by any order or instruction made or given in pursuance of law, or is guilty of any willful malfeasance or abuse of power, or of any corrupt conduct in his office, he shall be liable to all persons injured by any such neglect, or omission, malfeasance, abuse, or corrupt conduct, for all damages occasioned thereby; and for all such damages, he and his sureties upon his official bond shall be responsible thereon to the full amount of the penalty thereof, to be sued in the name of the United States for the use of the person injured. Such suit, however, shall in no case prejudice, but shall be held in entire subordination to, the interest, claims, and demands of the United States as against any officer, under such bond, for every willful act of malfeasance or corrupt conduct in his office. (R.S. 1735; U.S.C. title 22, sec. 103.)",

        "32. Retirement on account of age or length of service. When any Foreign Service officer has reached the age of 65 years and rendered at least 15 years of service, he shall be retired; and if any such officer shall have served 30 years, he may be retired at his own request before reaching the age of 65 years. The President may in his discretion retain any such officer on active duty for such period prior to his reaching 70 years of age as he may deem for the interests of the United States. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26d.)",
        "33. Retirement on account of disability. Any Foreign Service officer who before reaching the age of retirement becomes totally disabled for useful and efficient service by reason of disease or injury not due to vicious habits, intemperance, or willful misconduct on his part, shall, upon his own application or upon order of the President, be retired on an annuity. In each case such disability is determined by the report of a duly qualified physician or surgeon designated by the Secretary of State to conduct the examination. Unless the disability be permanent, a like examination is made annually in order to determine the degree of disability, and the payment of annuity ceases from the date of the medical examination showing recovery. The officer may thereupon be reassigned to active duty.",
        "Fees for examinations under this provision, together with reasonable traveling and other expenses incurred in order to submit to examination, are paid out of the Foreign Service retirement and disability fund. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26J.)",
        "34. Ambassadors, ministers, and persons appointed to the department. Any diplomatic secretary or consular officer who has been or any Foreign Service officer who may hereafter be promoted from the classified service to the grade of ambassador or minister, or appointed to a position in the Department of State, shall be entitled to retirement in the same manner and under the same conditions as Foreign Service officers, and any officer included under the act of May 24, 1924, and the amepdmjeiit thereto of July 3, 1926, shall be entitled to the benefits of the retirement provisions of the act of February 23, 1931. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26n.)",
        "35. Period of service. The period of service is computed from the date of original oath of office as diplomatic secretary, consul general, consul, vice consul, deputy consul, consular assistant, consular agent, commercial agent, interpreter, or student interpreter, and includes periods of service at different times as either a diplomatic or a consular officer, or while on assignment to the Department of State, or on special duty or service in another department or establishment of the Government, but all periods of separation from the service and so much of any period of leave of absence without pay as may exceed six months are excluded. Service in the Department of State or as clerk in a mission or consulate prior to appointment as a Foreign Service officer may be included in the period of service. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26o.)",
        "The President is authorized from time to time to establish, by Executive order, a list of places which by reason of climatic or other extreme conditions are to be classed as unhealthful posts; and each year of duty subsequent to January 1, 1900, at such posts, inclusive of regular leaves of absence, of officers already retired or hereafter retired, shall be counted as one year and a half, and so on in like proportion in reckoning the length of service for the purpose of retirement, fractional months being considered as full months in computing such service. The President may at any time cancel the designation of any places as unhealthful without affecting any credit which has accrued for service at such posts prior to the date of the cancellation. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26&.)",
        "36. Foreign Service retirement and disability fund. Five per centum of the basic salary of all Foreign Service officers eligible to retirement is contributed to the Foreign Service retirement and disability fund, and the Secretary of the Treasury causes such deductions to be made and the sums to be transferred on the books of the Treasury Department to the credit of the Foreign Service retirement and disability fund for the payment of annuities, refunds, and allowances.",
        "All basic salaries in excess of $10,000 per annum shall be treated as $10,000. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26c.)",

(Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26c.)",
        "The Secretary of State submits annually a comparative report showing all receipts and disbursements on account of refunds, allowances, and annuities, together with the total number of persons receiving annuities and the amounts paid them, and also submits annually estimates of appropriations necessary to continue the retirement and disability system in full force. The law provides that in no event shall the aggregate total appropriations exceed the aggregate total of the contributions of the Foreign Service officers theretofore made, and accumulated interest thereon. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26a.)",
        "The Secretary of the Treasury invests from time to time in interest-bearing securities of the United States such portions of the Foreign Service retirement and disability fund as in his judgment may not be immediately required for the payment of annuities, refunds, and allowances, and the income derived from such investments constitutes a part of said fund. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26g.)",
        "37. Period of contribution. Those officers who retire before having contributed for each year of service shall have withheld from their annuities to the credit of the Foreign Service retirement and disability fund such proportion of five per centum thereof as the number of years in which they did not contribute bears to the total length of service; but no deductions shall be made from the annuities of officers who have contributed 30 years, and no officer shall be required to contribute more than 30 years in any circumstances. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26/.)",

(Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26e.)",
        "39. Separation from service before retirement. Whenever a Foreign Service officer becomes separated from the service, except for disability before reaching the age of retirement, or under section 33 of the act of February 23, 1931, the total amount of contribution from his salary with interest thereon at 4 per centum per annum compounded annually up to the date of such separation shall be returned to him.

In case an annuitant dies without having received in annuities an amount equal to the total amount of his contributions from salary with interest thereon at 4 per centum per annum compounded annually up to the time of his death, the excess of said accumulated contribution over the said annuity payments is paid to his or her legal representatives. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26i.)",
        "42. Discontinuance of annuity. When an annuity is discontinued before the annuitant has received a sum equal to the total amount of his contributions with accrued interest, the difference is paid to him or to his legal representatives. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26J.)",

He shall, however, if he has not served at least 15 years, have returned to him the full sum of his contribution to the annuity fund, with interest thereon at 4 per centum compounded annually. The benefits of this section, except at the option of the Secretary of State the return of an officer's contribution to the annuity fund, shall not be given to Foreign Service officers separated from the Foreign Sendee on account of malfeasance in office.

No consular officer may be absent from his post or the performance of his duties for more than 10 days at any one time without obtaining permission from the President through the Secretary of State. (18 Stat. L. 77; U.S.C. title 22, sec. 124; 14 Op. Att. Gen. 534.) This provision permitting emergency absence for not to exceed 10 days is intended to relieve those cases of sudden emergency in which there is not sufficient time for communicating with the Secretary of State without endangering the health or affairs of the officer.",
        "No Foreign Service officer shall be absent from his post with pay for more than 48 hours without permission, except as authorized in these regulations (secs. 465-474). (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 22.)",
        "467. Conditions under which leaves oj absence are granted. Leave of absence is granted, within statutory limitations, at the discretion of the President, acting through the Secretary of State. Leaves of absence are of three kinds: simple leave, leave with permission to visit the United States, and sick leave. A consular officer must receive express permission to return to the United States, in order that he may be entitled to the benefit of the statutory allowance of salary in transit.",
        "(a) Simple leave and home leave. The Secretary of State is authorized to grant to any officer or employee of the Foreign Service who is an American citizen, in accordance with law and subject to such rules as may be established in the interests of and with due regard for the exigencies of the service, not to exceed 60 days annual leave of absence with pay. If such officer or employee returns to the United States, the leave of absence granted shall be exclusive of the time actually and necessarily occupied in going to his residence or destination in the United States and in returning to his post by the most direct route, and such time as may be necessarily occupied in awaiting sailing. Any portion of 60 days annual leave not granted or availed of in any one year may be cumulative, not to exceed, exclusive of time in transit and awaiting sailing, 120 days in three years or 180 days in four years.

        "(c) Leave on account of illness. The Secretary of State is also authorized to grant to any officer or employee of the Foreign Service on account of personal illness or on account of exposure to a contagious disease which would render presence at a post of duty hazardous to the health of fellow employees, sick leave of absence with pay at the rate of 15 days a year, the unused portion of such sick leave to be cumulative not to exceed 120 days.

Dec. 123) except that when all or a part of a transit period occurs in a calendar year other than that in which the leave of absence was taken, it will not impair the right of the consular officer to another transit period during that calendar year if leave should be granted.

        "468. Leave of absence discretionary with President. The statutes limit the period of a consular officer's or employee's absence from his post, but do not require that he be given leave of absence each year. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 22.) The President, acting through the Department of State, will determine in each case whether an officer or employee may be absent.",

In cases of emergency a principal officer may grant any vice consul leave, reporting the fact to the Secretary of State and procuring subsequent approval of the action taken.",
        "When a vice consul is in charge of an office, he should apply to the Secretary of State for leave in the same manner as if he were the principal. If there is no commissioned officer at the post to take charge, the fact should be reported to the department, by telegraph if necessary, for its consideration. In no circumstances should a consular office, without previous specific authority granted by the department, be left in the charge of any person other than a duly commissioned and bonded American consular officer.",
        "473. Leave of absence of clerks. The regulations in regard to leave of absence of principal consular officers, with the exception of provisions of section 470, are applicable to clerks and other employees in consular offices who are American citizens, except that the Secretary of State is authorized to establish rules and issue instructions consistent with law, and with due regard for the needs of the service, to permit principal officers to grant leave of absence, within the provisions of the law and these regulations, to such clerks and employees in their offices.",
        "Clerks and other employees in consular offices who are not American citizens may be granted leave of absence within statutory limits (see section 467) by their principal officers, who shall report the facts to the Secretary of State as required by section 465.",
        "In granting leave to clerks and subordinate employees, principal officers will bear in mind that leave must not be granted when the absence of the clerk will interfere with the transaction of the business of the office and that the absences of members of the staff will be so arranged that the work can be carried on without additional assistance. Consular officers in charge of posts will endeavor, so far as may be consistent with the proper transaction of the business of their offices, to grant all or part of the leave specified, in order that clerks and employees may have reasonable opportunity for rest and recreation.",

In regard to the sources of their compensation there are three classes of consular officers, viz, (1) those who are Foreign Service officers and receive their compensation as such from appropriations made by Congress, (2) those who are not Foreign Service officers but who are paid from specific appropriations made by Congress, and (3) consular agents receiving no regular remuneration but who are compensated from the fees collected for official services and in payments from the Treasury of the United States for services to American vessels and seamen.",
        "492. Foreign Service officers. Foreign Service officers assigned as consular officers receive salaries fixed by law and are entitled to compensation at the rate of their respective salaries as Foreign Service officers, with the following exceptions:",

(1) No consular officer shall receive salary for the time during which he may be absent from his post, by leave or otherwise, in excess of periods of absence which are authorized by law to be taken with pay (see secs. 465-474 of these regulations). (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 22.) (2) When a principal officer is absent from his post for a period exceeding 10 days at any one time, without permission previously obtained from the President through the Department of State, no portion of the salary will be allowed for any time in excess of the 10 days, unless the propriety and necessity of the absence shall be made clear to the department. (18 Stat. L. 77; U.S.C. title 22, sec. 124.)",
        "(b) Recall for malfeasance. A consular officer is not entitled to compensation in case he is recalled for malfeasance except to the date of the delivery of the notification of recall at the consular office to which he was last attached or, in the event of his absence therefrom, its delivery at his last known address; or if the officer resigns in anticipation of such recall, he is entitled to compensation only to the date of the acceptance of such resignation. In neither case will compensation be allowed for the time occupied in the transit to the United States.",
        "(c) Excess travel time. A consular officer traveling on leave with permission to visit the United States is not entitled to salary in transit for any time in excess of that actually and necessarily occupied in proceeding by direct route and generally adopted method of transport from his post to his place of residence or destination in the United States, or vice versa, and such time as may be necessarily occupied in awaiting sailing, except when complying with specific orders issued by the Department of State (section 467). (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 22.)",
        "493. Compensation when performing diplomatic duties. Within the discretion of the President, any Foreign Service officer may be assigned to act as commissioner, charge d'affaires, minister resident, or diplomatic agent for such period as the public interest may require without loss of grade, class, or salary, provided that no such officer shall receive more than one salary. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 24.) With the exception of commissioner, these appointments are subject to confirmation by the Senate.",
        "494. Additional compensation. For such times as any Foreign Service officer is lawfully authorized to act as charg\u00e9 d'affaires ad interim or to assume charge of a consulate general or consulate during the absence of the principal officer at the post to which he shall have been assigned, he shall, if his salary is less than one-half that of such principal officer, receive in addition to his salary as Foreign Service officer, compensation equal to the difference between such salary and one-half of the salary provided by law for the ambassador, minister, or principal consular officer, as the case may be. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 26.)",
        "Under such regulations as the President may prescribe, and within the limitations of such appropriations as may be made therefor, which appropriations are hereby authorized, ambassadors, ministers, diplomatic, consular, and Foreign Service officers may be granted allowances for representation, and also post allowances wherever the cost of living may be proportionately so high that in the opinion of the Secretary of State such allowances are necessary to enable such diplomatic, consular, and Foreign Service officers to carry on their work efficiently. All such allowances shall be accounted for to the Secretary of State in such manner and under such rules and regulations as the President may prescribe; and the authorization and approval of such expenditures by the Secretary of State, as complying with such rules and regulations, shall be binding upon all officers of the Government. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 19.)",

        "Vice consuls not of career, receiving compensation as clerks, are entitled to compensation when traveling to and from their posts, or elsewhere, under orders of the Secretary of State, or while on leave of absence, subject to the law and regulations governing leaves of absence.",
        "Vice consuls while in charge of a consulate general or consulate during the absence of the principal officer are entitled to additional compensation in the same manner and under the same conditions as Foreign Service officers. (43 Stat. L. 1016, 1017; U.S.C. title 22, secs. 35, 56.)",
        "496. Language officers. Language officers receive their salaries as Foreign Service officers. In addition they may be provided with tuition and quarters.",
        "497. Consular agents. Consular agents are paid by one-half of the fees received in their offices, up to a maximum sum of $1,000, in any one year, the other half being accounted for and paid into the Treasury of the United States. If the total amount of fees received at a consular agency during a fiscal year exceeds $2,000, such surplus must be remitted in full to the Treasury of the United States in addition to the $1,000 due the Government as prescribed above. (34 Stat. L. 101; 43 Stat. L. 142; U.S.C. title 22, sec. 99.)",
        "498. Resignation in the United States. The right to compensation of a consular officer who resigns while in the United States on leave of absence terminates with the date of the acceptance of the resignation, or the lapse of his statutory leave, whichever first occurs.",
        "499. Allowance to widow or heirs. It has been provided by law that whenever a consular officer dies in a foreign country in the discharge of his duty, there shall be paid to his widow, or, if no widow survive him, then to his heirs at law, a sum of money equal to the allowance made to such officer for the time necessarily occupied in making the transit from his post of duty to his residence in the United States. The amount is paid directly to the wddow, or heirs, as the case may be. (R.S. sec. 1749; U.S.C. title 22, sec. 130.)",
        "500. Extra compensation prohibited. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the compensation allowed by law to the various Foreign Service officers and other consular officers is in full for all the services rendered and for personal expenses incurred by the persons respectively for whom such compensation is provided, of whatever kind such services or personal expenses may be, or by whatever treaty, law, or instructions they are required; and no allowance, other than such as may be specifically provided by law, is made in any case for the outfit or return home of any such officer or person. (R. S. 1743; U.S.C. title 22, sec. 125.)",
        "501. Fees applicable to salaries and expenses. All fees and other official moneys received by diplomatic missions or consular offices or by district accounting and disbursing offices established under section 35 of the act of February 23, 1931, may be transmitted through the Department of State for deposit in the United States Treasury or may be used in payment of salaries, allowances, and current expenses of such missions and offices, the residue, if any, to be transmitted through the Department of State for deposit in the United States Treasury. (Act of Feb. 23, 1931, sec. 36.)",
