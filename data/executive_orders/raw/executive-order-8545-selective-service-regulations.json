        "102. The processes of selective service. Selective Service involves these processes: Registration, classification and selection, and delivery for induction. Registration is the process by which all males subject to registration under the selective service law are listed by name, and constitutes an inventory of manpower for military purposes. Classification and selection is the process by which the relative availability of the individual men for military service is determined, and those who are most available are selected. Induction is the process by which the men selected for military service pass from the status of civilians to the status of members of the land and naval forces of the United States.",
        "The Elements of Selective Service System",
        "103. The elements of the Selective Service System. The elements of the Selective Service System are shown on the accompanying chart (page 721). In general, the elements operate as follows. The election machinery, or other designated agencies, accomplishes the registration. The Local Board classifies registrants, and has assigned to it a physician to make physical examinations and a Government Appeal Agent to protect the interests of the Government and of registrants. An Advisory Board for Registrants is appointed to advise and assist registrants in filling out questionnaires, making appeals, etc. The Medical Advisory Board, made up of specialists, assists in determining doubtful cases of physical condition. The Board of Appeal reviews Local Board decisions as to classification when appeal is made. All of the above elements will be composed of, and administered by, civilians. The State Headquarters operates the Selective Service System within the State; the National Headquarters, within the nation.",
