        "\"On whom drafts are to be drawn. Drafts on the Secretary of State are to be drawn at 5 days after sight, acceptance waived and endorsements by procuration excepted; Provided, however, That the number of days may be changed by the Secretary of State, in his discretion, to not more than 10.\"",
        "Section 328 of the Consular Regulations is hereby amended to read as follows:",
        "\"328. When consul may reward rescuing crew. If, after investigating the facts and circumstances of the rescue, in the judgment of the consular officer, the master and the rescuing boat's crew, or any of them, are deserving of reward, he is authorized to pay to such master and boat's crew, or to any of them, without previous reference of the matter to the Department of State, a sum of money ranging from $5 to $25, according to the rank and merit of the recipient. In making these payments the consular officer is authorized to draw on the Secretary of State for a sufficient amount. A separate account of the expenditure, supported by vouchers, must be sent to the Department immediately on payment of the money. (Form No. 170.)",
        "In making these awards it is expected that consular officers will exercise due diligence and sound discretion. Humane as well as heroic action is deemed deserving of recognition, though in a less degree; and sacrifice of business interests as well as disregard of personal peril. Volunteer efforts should also be rated higher than compulsory action under the orders of a superior.",
        "Accompanying the accounts should be sent a full statement of the facts of each case, in conformity with the provisions of the foregoing paragraph, in order that the Department may determine what further action, if any, should be taken to do justice to all the parties to the rescue.",
        "When the action of the master or any member of the crew is deemed deserving of a more liberal acknowledgment, or one different from that herein authorized to be made, the report should fully demonstrate his title to other or additional recognition.\"",
        "This order supersedes Executive Order No. 6810-A, of August 4, 1934.",
        "FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT",
        "The White House,April 15, 1935."
