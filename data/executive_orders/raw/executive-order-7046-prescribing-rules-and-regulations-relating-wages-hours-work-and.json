        "REGULATION NO. 1",
        "By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, approved April 8, 1935 (Public Resolution No. 11, 74th Congress), I hereby prescribe the following rules and regulations:",
        "PART I-WAGES",
        "Except as hereinafter provided, earnings of workers on projects financed in whole or in part from funds appropriated by the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 shall be on a monthly salary basis, the earnings differing according to various regions, degree of urbanization, and classes of work prescribed herein.",
        "The monthly earnings are in the nature of a salary and workers shall be paid for time lost due to weather conditions or temporary interruptions in the project beyond the control of the workers. In order to be credited for such time lost, the worker must report on the job and be officially dismissed for the day unless otherwise notified by the project supervisor. Deductions from monthly earnings shall be made for time lost because of voluntary absence, illness, completion or postponement of a project, or permanent dismissal. In order to assure an adequate income to workers, the Works Progress Administration shall make every effort to provide a continuous flow of suitable projects in each locality.",
        "The monthly earnings shall be in accordance with the following schedule:",
        "SCHEDULE OF MONTHLY EARNINGS",
        "Counties in which the 1930 population of the largest municipality was",
        "Monthly earnings applicable to a city should in general apply also to contiguous urban areas, even though such urban areas are not in the same county. Monthly earnings applicable to the largest municipality in a county should in general apply also to the remainder of the county in which the municipality is located, but need not necessarily so apply in event that local circumstances warrant a different rate of earnings. If the territory covered by the operation of any individual project involves the application of more than one schedule of monthly earnings, the schedule of monthly earnings for any class of work on the project should be the higher schedule involved. In order to allow for these and any other adjustments, the Works Progress Administrator or his representative may adjust the rate of earnings for any class of work in a locality by not more than 10 per cent from the monthly earnings shown in the foregoing schedule.",
        "The monthly earnings basis referred to heretofore and shown in the foregoing schedule shall be applicable to workers on all projects financed in whole or in part from the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 except:",

        "(a) For persons employed on a salary basis in accordance with the schedule provided in Part I the maximum hours of work shall be determined by the Works Progress Administrator but shall not be in excess of 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week.",

        "(e) For Emergency Conservation Work and work relief under the supervision of State and local emergency relief administrations, existing applicable rules and regulations in regard to hours shall remain in force.",
