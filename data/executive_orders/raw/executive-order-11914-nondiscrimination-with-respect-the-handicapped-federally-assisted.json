(a) Whenever the appropriate department or agency determines, upon all the information available to it, that any recipient of, or applicant for, Federal financial assistance is in noncompliance with the requirements adopted pursuant to this order, steps to secure voluntary compliance shall be carried out in accordance with standards and procedures established pursuant to this order.",
        "(b) If voluntary compliance cannot be secured by informal means, compliance with section 504 may be effected by the suspension or termination of, or refusal to award or continue, Federal financial assistance or by other appropriate means authorized by law, in accordance with standards and procedures established pursuant to this order.",
        "(c) No such suspension or termination of, or refusal to award or continue, Federal financial assistance shall become effective unless there has been an express finding, after opportunity for a hearing, of a failure by the recipient of, or applicant for, Federal financial assistance to comply with the requirements adopted pursuant to this order; however, such suspension or termination of, or refusal to award or continue, Federal financial assistance shall be limited in its effect to the particular program or activity or part thereof with respect to which there has been such a finding of noncompliance.",
