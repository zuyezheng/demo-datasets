        "WHEREAS after investigation I find and proclaim that as a result of a labor disturbance there are existing interruptions of the operations of transportation systems, plants, and facilities owned or operated by companies conducting towing and transportation operations in New York Harbor and contiguous waters (including but not limited to the transportation systems, plants, and facilities of the companies named in the list attached hereto and made a part hereof); that the war effort will be unduly impeded and delayed by such interruptions ; that it has become necessary to take possession and assume control of said transportation systems, plants, and facilities for purposes that are needful or desirable in connection with the present wartime emergency; and that the exercise, as hereinafter specified, of the powers vested in me is necessary to insure in the national interest the operation of the said transportation systems, plants, and facilities.",
        "NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including section 9 of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 as amended by section 3 of the War Labor Disputes Act (57 Stat. 164), the act of August 29, 1916, 39 Stat. 619, 645, and the First War Powers Act, 1941 (55 Stat. 838), as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, it is hereby ordered as follows:",
        "1. The Director of the Office of Defense Transportation is authorized and directed , through or with the aid of any public officers, Federal agencies, or other governmental instrumentalities that he may designate, to take possession and assume control of the said transportation systems, plants, and facilities owned or operated by companies conducting towing or transportation operations in New York Harbor and contiguous waters (including but not limited to the transportation systems, plants, and facilities of the companies named in the list attached hereto and made a part hereof), including all real and personal property and other assets used or useful in connection with the operation of such transportation systems, plants, and facilities in such manner as he may deem necessary to carry out the provisions and to accomplish the purposes of this order.",
        "2. Subject to applicable provisions of existing law, including the orders of the Office of Defense Transportation issued pursuant to Executive Order 8989, as amended, the said transportation systems, plants, and facilities shall be managed and operated under the terms and conditions of employment in effect at the time possession is taken under this order.",
        "3. Except with the prior written consent of the Director, no attachment by mesne process, garnishment, execution, or otherwise shall be levied on or against any of the real or personal property or other assets, tangible or intangible, in the possession of the Director hereunder.",
        "4. Possession, control, and operation of any plant or facility, or of any transportation system, or any part thereof, or of any real or personal property taken under this order shall be terminated by the Director when he determines that such possession, control, and operation are no longer necessary to carry out the provisions, and to accomplish the purposes, of this order.",
        "5. For the purposes of paragraphs 1 to 4, inclusive, of this order, there are hereby transferred to the Director the functions, powers, and duties vested in the Secretary of War by that part of section 1 of the said act of August 29, 1916, reading as follows:",
        "\"The President, in time of war, is empowered, through the Secretary of War, to take possession and assume control of any system or systems of transportation, or any part thereof, and to utilize the same, to the exclusion as far as may be necessary of all other traffic thereon, for the transfer of transportation of troops, war material and equipment, or for such other purposes in connection with the emergency as may be needful or desirable.\"",
        "6. The Director of the Office of Defense Transportation may request the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy to furnish protection for persons employed or seeking employment in the plants, facilities, or transportation systems of which possession is taken, to furnish protection for such plants, facilities, and transportation systems, and to furnish equipment, manpower, and other facilities or services deemed necessary by the Director to carry out the provisions, and to accomplish the purposes, of this order. The Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy are authorized and directed, upon such requests, to take such action as they deem necessary to furnish such protection, equipment, manpower, or other facilities or services.",
