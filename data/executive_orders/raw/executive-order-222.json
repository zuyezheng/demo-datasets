        "\"In the Post-Office Department: Captain of the watch.\"",

        "\"I would request that places in the Post-Office Department subject to noncompetitive examination be increased by including the position of captain of the watch, as the duties of the position are of such a nature that the head of the Department should be permitted to recommend for examination such person as would possess such other qualifications in addition to the merely clerical ones as would commend him to the head of he Department to fill satisfactorily such position.\"",
