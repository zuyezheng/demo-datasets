        "H. Charles Spruks may be appointed to a classified position in the Department of State without compliance with the civil service rules.",
        "This order is recommended by the Acting Secretary of State because of Mr. Spruks's unique experience in visa work at two of the most difficult posts in the American Foreign Service which qualifies him as an expert in visa matters. Mr. Sprulis was appointed a Foreign Service officer, unclassified, February 5, 1927, after having passed the Foreign Service examination and was immediately assigned to the consulate general at Habana, Cuba, for visa work. After approximately one year's service at Habana Mr. Spruks was detailed to the Department of State for duty in the Foreign Service School, and while serving in this capacity he completed an intensive course of training in visa work with the highest rating in a class of thirty-five. On June 29, 1928, he was assigned to the consulate general at Warsaw, Poland, and placed in charge of visa work, in which capacity he remained until March 9, 1929, when he resigned from the Foreign Service because of urgent family and business reasons requiring his presence in the United States.",
