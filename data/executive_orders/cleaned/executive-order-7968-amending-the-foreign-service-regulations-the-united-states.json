These officers shall keep a general cash book and such other account books as may be required, according to the needs of their offices, to show all details of receipts and expenditures, to insure accuracy, and to enable the principal officers to exercise complete control over the funds of their offices.",
        "V\u20132. Accounts rendered monthly. (a) All accounts, except an account for a period of less than a full month when an officer has surrendered charge temporarily or is submitting a final account at an office, must be rendered at the end of each calendar month and these accounts are to be designated according to the following form:",

At the close of any accounting period (month or fractional part thereof) officers of whatever title who have qualified to collect or disburse, or both, moneys on account of the United States and during such period have had no advances of funds, made no collections or disbursements, and have no balance to be accounted for, shall fill out a report of no transactions, Standard Form 1063, execute the certificate thereon, and transmit it to the Department of State within the time prescribed for transmitting their accounts.

At embassies and legations, including combined offices, except where special disbursing officers are assigned, the highest ranking Foreign Service officer on the staff of the mission shall be the accounting officer. The chief of mission may, if he considers it necessary to the efficient operation o1 the mission, propose to the Department of State the designation for this duty of a Foreign Service officer on the staff of the mission other than the highest ranking officer, but such nomination must be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for it and shall not be effective unless approved by the Department of State. The accounting officer shall render accounts and returns covering all receipts and expenditures of the mission or combined office as required by pertinent regulations and instructions, including accounts and returns covering the salaries and allowances of all officers and employees. In the performance of their fiscal duties, the accounting officers of missions are directly responsible under their bonds to the Government and to the departments for which they make disbursements.",

(a) Where a principal officer is absent temporarily for one or more brief intervals during an accounting period and the officer temporarily in charge during such absence draws no drafts and makes no disbursements, the principal officer may submit the account for the full accounting period and it will be a sufficient accounting by the relief officer if he (1) complies with the provisions relating to fee stamps, (2) executes the certificate for a vice consul or other officer in charge, on the reverse of the principal officer's account current, and (3)-submits with such certificate a schedule of collections on the form prescribed and a sworn record of fees collected by him supported by the receipt of the principal officer for the amount of such collections turned over to him.",

        "V\u201311. Deposit of public money. (a) No Foreign Service officer or employee shall deposit public funds in a bank in a foreign country except where such banks have been designated as United States Government depositories by the Secretary of the Treasury under the provisions of the act of June 19, 1922.

        "(b) Officers of the Foreign Service of the United States may when necessary, in their discretion and at their own risk, make temporary deposits of funds on hand and maintain accounts with banking institutions which they may select for the purpose, except where Government depositories have been designated. Nothing in this authorization may be construed to relieve them of complete responsibility to account for official funds coming into their possession.",
        "(c) When official funds are deposited temporarily in a bank, the deposit should be made in the name of and to the credit of the office rather than the officer wherever the banking facilities at a given post permit such practice. Official and personal bank accounts must be kept separate and distinct in all cases.",
        "(d) All officers of the Foreign Service, before depositing funds in a bank of the United States, should ascertain whether such bank has been designated as a depositary of public moneys received by such officers.",

All charges for such services must be in strict accordance with this tariff, and be collected in the coin of the United States or at its representative value in exchange. (22 U.S.C. \u00a7 128.) For each and every fee where the representative value in exchange is collected instead of the coin of the United States, there shall be collected a sufficient amount of foreign currency to enable the officer to purchase as of the date of collection a sight draft in the amount of the fee as prescribed by this tariff payable at par to the Treasurer of the United States. No fee or compensation will be collected for any service not covered by this tariff.",
        "(b) No fees prescribed in this tariff shall be charged or collected by officers for official services to American vessels or seamen. (22 U.S.C. \u00a7 89.)

        "(b) Prior authorization required. No refund of fees shall be made in any case by an officer of the Foreign Service until a request in writing therefor has been referred to the Secretary of State for administrative consideration of the circumstances involved and specific authorization for the refund has been received.",

        "(c) Every diplomatic or consular officer, in rendering his account of fees received, shall furnish a full transcript of the register which he is required to keep, and make oath that, to the best of his knowledge, the same is true, and contains a full and accurate statement of all fees received by him, or for his use, for his official services as such officer, during the period for which it purports to be rendered. Such oath may be taken before any person having authority to administer oaths at the port or place where the officer is located.",

        "V\u201321. Fees for services for foreign governments. When an office of the United States has been authorized to undertake representation of the interests of a foreign government in accordance with the provisions of sections 174 and 453 of Part II of the Foreign Service Regulations, any officer of the United States who discharges consular duties for that foreign government is not a consular officer of the foreign government but is an agent of it only insofar as the discharge of duties and responsibility for his official acts are concerned. The tariff of fees of the foreign government should be followed, if available, but if not, the United States tariff of Foreign Service fees is applicable. To the extent to which the laws or instructions of the foreign government permit the consular officer to retain fees collected in its name, these fees are the fees of the consular office and must be paid over and accounted for to the Government of the United States. Fees collected by a diplomatic or consular officer for these services, which the officer is not authorized to retain, shall be disposed of and accounted for in accordance with the instructions of the Secretary of State.",
        "V\u201322. Fees of consular agents. (a) Consular agents shall be entitled to retain as compensation one-half of the fees received in their offices provided that in no case shall such compensation exceed $1,000 per annum. The balance of all fees received shall be accounted for and paid into the Treasury of the United States. (22 U.S.C. \u00a7 99.)",
        "(b) For official services to American vessels consular agents who are compensated by fees must furnish the master of every such vessel with an itemized statement of the services performed on account of said vessel showing the fee prescribed by the tariff of fees for each service. If the amount received or due consular agents from regular fees collected by them is not equivalent to compensation at the rate of $1,000 per annum, they will be allowed from the appropriation therefor such additional compensation as they would have received, and would have been entitled to retain but for the exemption of these vessels from the payment of such fees to a maximum total compensation of $1,000. (22 U.S.C. \u00a7 89; 31 U.S.C. 725a (5).) Such services will not be compensated unless they are necessarily rendered. (22 U.S.C. \u00a7 89.)",
        "(c) Consular agents shall account for fees collected and furnish reports of services to American vessels and seamen, including the fees prescribed therefor, and shall be compensated for such services in accordance with the provisions of these regulations and the instructions of the Secretary of State.

        "(3) That official collections be remitted or applied to disbursements in such manner as he shall deem necessary to meet unusual or unforeseen circumstances or conditions.",
        "(b) All receipts from consular fees and all other official receipts of any Foreign Service post within the jurisdiction of a district accounting and disbursing office will be included in accounts of the responsible diplomatic, consular, or Foreign Service officers to the district office at the same intervals and in a manner similar to that prescribed in this article for the submission of such accounts and return directly to the Department of State by all officers not within a fiscal district.
