    "critique": "This document revokes a previous executive order to allow voluntary enlistments in the armed forces. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It does not relate to immigration. It is difficult to assess whether this restricts or expands executive power, but I will assume it is neutral. It does not relate to federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
