    "critique": "The document is an executive order imposing trade restrictions on Southern Rhodesia in response to a UN Security Council resolution. It reflects a multilateralist approach to foreign policy and a willingness to use economic sanctions to achieve political goals. There is no direct discussion of immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation within the US, or social inclusion within the US. Therefore, the scores on these axes are based on inferences from the document's general context and purpose.",
