    "critique": "This executive order implements UN Security Council Resolution 232, which places sanctions on Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) due to its racial segregation policies. \n\nIdeological Tilt: This is difficult to place on a traditional left-right spectrum. Supporting human rights and opposing racial discrimination could be seen as generally aligned with liberal values, but the specific context of international relations makes it hard to assign a strong score. I'll start with a +2.\nImmigration Approach: This order doesn't directly deal with immigration, so it should be neutral. Score: 0\nExecutive Power: The order relies on existing laws and UN resolutions, suggesting it's not a major expansion of executive power. Score: 0\nFederalism: The order doesn't significantly shift power between the federal government and the states. Score: 0\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The order doesn't directly impact national security or civil liberties. Score: 0\nEconomic Regulation: The order imposes trade restrictions, which is a form of government intervention in the economy. Score: +3\nSocial Inclusion: The order aims to combat racial discrimination in Southern Rhodesia, promoting social inclusion on an international level. Score: +4\n\nRevised Scores:\nIdeological Tilt: +2 (remains the same)\nImmigration Approach: 0 (remains the same)\nExecutive Power: 0 (remains the same)\nFederalism: 0 (remains the same)\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0 (remains the same)\nEconomic Regulation: +3 (remains the same)\nSocial Inclusion: +4 (remains the same)",
