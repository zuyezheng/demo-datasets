    "critique": "The document pertains to delaying certain transfers, consolidations, and eliminations provided for under section 4 of Executive Order No. 6166. It extends previous executive orders and allows the Secretary of the Treasury, approved by the President, to make operative and effective changes between June 30, 1936, and December 31, 1936. This suggests a moderate expansion of executive power and government intervention in economic matters through the Treasury.",
