    "critique": "This document is an executive order that delays certain transfers, consolidations, and eliminations provided for under section 4 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, as amended, beyond the effective date of the said order. It appears to be related to economic regulation and the organization of the government. There is no mention of immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The order seems to grant some discretion to the Secretary of the Treasury, approved by the President, which could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power.",
