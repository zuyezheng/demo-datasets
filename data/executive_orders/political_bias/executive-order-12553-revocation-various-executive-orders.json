    "critique": "This executive order revokes a large number of previous executive orders. Many of these relate to the creation of emergency boards to investigate labor disputes, particularly in the railroad and airline industries. There are also orders related to selective service, foreign aid, and various commissions and councils. Because the document simply eliminates previous orders, it is difficult to assign a strong ideological leaning. However, the elimination of a large number of orders related to labor disputes could be interpreted as slightly favoring deregulation or less government intervention in labor matters. The revocation of selective service related orders could be seen as slightly leaning towards less national security focus. The document does not seem to have any direct impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral, with slight adjustments for economic regulation and security/liberty.",
