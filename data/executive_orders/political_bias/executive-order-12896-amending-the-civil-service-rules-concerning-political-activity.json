    "critique": "This document is a simple revocation of a civil service rule. It's difficult to assess its impact on most of the axes without knowing the specifics of the rule being revoked. However, we can make some educated guesses. Given it's a civil service rule, it likely has some impact on economic regulation and potentially social inclusion. Since it's a revocation, it might lean towards deregulation and less intervention. Without knowing the specifics, it's hard to say for sure. It's unlikely to have a significant impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, or national security vs. civil liberties.",
