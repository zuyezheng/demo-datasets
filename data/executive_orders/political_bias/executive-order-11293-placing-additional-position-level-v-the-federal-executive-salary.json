    "critique": "This document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order, adding a name to a list within the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration. It's a bureaucratic update with minimal ideological content. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. There's no clear indication of a shift in executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document doesn't touch on immigration at all. The only possible slight tilt might be towards environmental regulation, but it's too indirect to score significantly.",
