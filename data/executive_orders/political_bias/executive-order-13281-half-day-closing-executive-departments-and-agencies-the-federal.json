    "critique": "This executive order pertains to closing executive branch departments and agencies for half a day on December 24, 2002. It allows exceptions for national security, defense, or other public reasons, and clarifies that this day falls within the scope of existing regulations regarding pay and leave for federal employees. There is minimal ideological content. It does not address immigration, executive power significantly, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties in a substantial way, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
