    "critique": "This document pertains to the transfer of land between two national forests in California. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order simply reassigns land management responsibilities within the federal government. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism axis leans slightly towards federal control as it involves the federal government managing national forests.",
