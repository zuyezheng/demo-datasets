    "critique": "This executive order primarily concerns the transfer of authority and assets from the Philippine Alien Property Administration to the Attorney General. It's a bureaucratic restructuring rather than a policy statement with strong ideological implications. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The order doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It also doesn't seem to significantly alter economic regulation or federalism. The executive power axis is slightly positive as it consolidates power within the executive branch, but it's not a major expansion.",
