    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous order regarding the establishment of the Air Medal. It broadens the criteria for awarding the medal to any person serving in any capacity in or with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard of the United States, subsequent to September 8, 1939, who distinguishes himself by meritorious achievement while participating in an aerial flight. There is no clear ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on federalism. It does not obviously expand executive power, as it is an amendment within existing presidential authority. It does not directly address national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
