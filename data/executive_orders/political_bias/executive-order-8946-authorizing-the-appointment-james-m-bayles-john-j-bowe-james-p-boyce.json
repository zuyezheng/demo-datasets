    "critique": "This document is a waiver of Civil Service Rules for specific individuals to be appointed as guards. It is a very specific action, and doesn't lend itself to broad ideological statements. It is narrowly focused on appointments within the Public Buildings Administration. There's no clear indication of a liberal or conservative agenda. The document does not address immigration. The document could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, as it bypasses standard civil service rules, but it is a very limited case. The document does not obviously relate to federalism. The document does not obviously relate to national security vs. civil liberties. The document does not obviously relate to economic regulation. The document does not obviously relate to social inclusion.",
