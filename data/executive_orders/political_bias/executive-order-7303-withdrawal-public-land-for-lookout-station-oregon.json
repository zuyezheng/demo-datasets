    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the use of a specific tract of land. It withdraws the land from public use and reserves it for the Forest Service. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism concerns, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The federalism score is slightly positive because it involves federal land management.",
