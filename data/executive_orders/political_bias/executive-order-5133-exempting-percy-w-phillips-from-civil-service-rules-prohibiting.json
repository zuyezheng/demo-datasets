    "critique": "This document is a waiver to an executive order to allow a federal employee to teach at a state university. This seems like a fairly minor action. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt, immigration approach, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion based on this document. It seems to favor state control, and it does not seem to expand executive power.",
