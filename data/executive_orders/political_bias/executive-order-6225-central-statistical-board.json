    "critique": "The document establishes a Central Statistical Board to coordinate statistical services of the Federal Government related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. This suggests a moderate level of government intervention in the economy. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the interventionist nature of the National Industrial Recovery Act.",
