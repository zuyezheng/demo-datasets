    "critique": "This document establishes a wildlife refuge. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt as it is primarily an environmental conservation measure. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be neutral. There might be a slight lean towards expanding executive power as it's an executive order, but it's a fairly standard use of that power for conservation purposes.",
