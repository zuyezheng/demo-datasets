    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that approves a new seal for the Department of Justice. It doesn't directly address any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order simply changes the design of the Department of Justice seal. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
