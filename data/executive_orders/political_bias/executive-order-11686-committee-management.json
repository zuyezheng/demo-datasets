    "critique": "This document establishes guidelines for federal advisory committees, replacing a previous executive order. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It delegates authority to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for managing these committees and ensuring compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The action appears neutral in terms of executive power, federalism, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, initial scores are set to 0 across all axes.",
