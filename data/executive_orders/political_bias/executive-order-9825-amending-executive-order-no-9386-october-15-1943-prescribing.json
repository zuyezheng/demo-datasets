    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending a previous executive order regarding allowances for military personnel. It adjusts the amounts for quarters and subsistence. There is no clear ideological tilt, immigration component, or impact on civil liberties. It has a very slight impact on economic regulation, and no impact on social inclusion. It could be argued that it has a very slight impact on executive power, but I will leave it at neutral. It has no impact on federalism.",
