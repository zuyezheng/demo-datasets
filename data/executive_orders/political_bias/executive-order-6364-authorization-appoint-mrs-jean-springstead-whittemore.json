    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1933 that appoints Mrs. Jean Springstead Whittemore as collector of customs for Puerto Rico, bypassing civil service rules. This action, recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury, reflects the executive branch's authority to make appointments. The order does not explicitly address ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. However, the act of bypassing civil service rules could be interpreted as an expansion of executive power.",
