    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1933 that appoints Mrs. Jean Springstead Whittemore to the position of collector of customs for Puerto Rico without compliance with civil-service rules. The order is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nIdeological Tilt: The document itself doesn't express a clear ideological stance. It's an administrative decision related to a specific appointment. Score: 0\n\nImmigration Approach: The document relates to the collector of customs for Puerto Rico, which indirectly involves border control. However, the document doesn't explicitly address immigration policies. Score: 0\n\nExecutive Power: The document uses executive authority to bypass civil service rules for a specific appointment. This suggests an expansion of executive power, albeit in a limited context. Score: 2\n\nFederalism: The document concerns a federal appointment in Puerto Rico, indicating federal control. Score: 3\n\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The document waives civil service rules, which could be seen as a minor infringement on established procedures designed to ensure fair hiring practices. Score: 1\n\nEconomic Regulation: The document doesn't directly address economic regulation. The collector of customs could have some influence on trade, but the appointment itself isn't a regulatory measure. Score: 0\n\nSocial Inclusion: The document appoints a woman to a position, which could be seen as a positive step for gender equality in 1933. Score: 1\n\nRevised Scores:\n\nIdeological Tilt: 0\nImmigration Approach: 0\nExecutive Power: 2\nFederalism: 3\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: 1\nEconomic Regulation: 0\nSocial Inclusion: 1",
