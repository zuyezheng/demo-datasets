    "critique": "This executive order from 1941 restricts air traffic over Washington D.C. for national defense, governmental, and public safety purposes. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it expands executive power by creating an airspace reservation, but it's also rooted in existing legislation (Air Commerce Act of 1926). It centralizes control over airspace at the federal level. It prioritizes national security by restricting air navigation. It has no direct impact on economic regulation. Therefore, the scores should reflect these considerations.",
