    "critique": "This document primarily terminates committees and revokes executive orders. It also amends the executive order regarding the Medal of Freedom, giving the President more discretion in selecting recipients. There's a slight shift towards expanding executive power in the Medal of Freedom amendment. The termination of committees could be seen as slightly conservative, reducing government bureaucracy. There's no clear indication of bias on immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
