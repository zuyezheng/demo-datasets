    "critique": "This executive order focuses on promoting entrepreneurship both domestically and internationally. It establishes programs and initiatives to connect entrepreneurs with resources, networks, and training. It also emphasizes global internet connectivity. There is a slight tilt towards economic intervention through government support for entrepreneurship, but it also promotes free markets. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
