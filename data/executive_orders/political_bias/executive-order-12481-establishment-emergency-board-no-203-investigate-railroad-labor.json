    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between a rail road and a union. It is a fairly procedural action, and doesn't touch on many of the axes of political bias. It has a slight impact on economic regulation, as it prevents changes to the conditions out of which the dispute arose, but this is temporary. It doesn't seem to have any implications for immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is also neutral.",
