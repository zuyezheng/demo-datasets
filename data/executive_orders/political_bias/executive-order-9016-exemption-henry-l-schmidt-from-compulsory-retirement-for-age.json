    "critique": "This is an executive order that extends the exemption of an employee from compulsory retirement. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It has a very slight impact on executive power, as it exercises it, but it's a routine action. It doesn't relate to federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
