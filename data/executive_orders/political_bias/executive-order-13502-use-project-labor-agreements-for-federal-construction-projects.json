    "critique": "The document encourages the use of project labor agreements (PLAs) for large-scale federal construction projects. PLAs typically involve collective bargaining with labor organizations, potentially leading to increased union involvement in federal projects. The order aims to promote efficiency and economy in federal procurement by preventing labor disputes and ensuring compliance with labor laws. It also revokes prior executive orders that restricted the use of PLAs.",
