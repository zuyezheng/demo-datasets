    "critique": "This document is an executive order that modifies the Executive Schedule by adding positions to levels IV and V. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The addition of positions could be seen as a very slight expansion of the executive branch, but it's minimal.",
