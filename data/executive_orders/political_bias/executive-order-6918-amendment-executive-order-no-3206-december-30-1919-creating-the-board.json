    "critique": "This executive order simply adds the Tennessee Valley Authority to the list of organizations entitled to membership on the Board of Surveys and Maps. This seems like a fairly neutral action with minimal political implications. It doesn't strongly lean in any particular ideological direction, nor does it significantly impact immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
