    "critique": "This document is an executive order that allows the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to inspect income tax returns from 1945 to 1958 for the purpose of investigating antitrust and anti-monopoly laws in professional boxing. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The opening of tax records to a Senate committee could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it is primarily for oversight purposes.",
