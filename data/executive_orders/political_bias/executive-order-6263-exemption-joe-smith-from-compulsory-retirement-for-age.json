    "critique": "This is a very specific action concerning one individual. It is difficult to extract broad political implications from such a narrow scope. The document is an executive order that makes an exception to a rule about retirement age for a specific government employee. It does not seem to have a significant impact on ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it touches on is executive power, as it uses the power granted to the president to make an exception to a rule. However, this is a limited and specific use of executive power, so the score should be moderate.",
