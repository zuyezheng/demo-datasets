    "critique": "This document rescinds two executive orders from the Civil War era that prohibited the exportation of arms, ammunition, horses, mules, and livestock. The rescission is based on the determination that these orders are 'no longer required by public necessities.'\n\n1. Ideological Tilt: 0. This is a practical decision related to wartime restrictions, not directly tied to a left-right ideological spectrum.\n2. Immigration Approach: 0. The document does not address immigration.\n3. Executive Power: -1. Rescinding executive orders suggests a slight reduction in executive power, as it removes restrictions previously imposed.\n4. Federalism: 0. The document does not significantly impact the balance between state and federal power.\n5. National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0. The rescission could be seen as slightly favoring economic activity over national security, but the impact is minimal.\n6. Economic Regulation: -1. Rescinding export restrictions leans slightly towards deregulation.\n7. Social Inclusion: 0. The document has no bearing on social inclusion.\n\nRevised scores:\n1. Ideological Tilt: 0\n2. Immigration Approach: 0\n3. Executive Power: -1\n4. Federalism: 0\n5. National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0\n6. Economic Regulation: -1\n7. Social Inclusion: 0",
