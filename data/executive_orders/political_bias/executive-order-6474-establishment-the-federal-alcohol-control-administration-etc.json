    "critique": "This document establishes the Federal Alcohol Control Administration in 1933. It is part of President Roosevelt's New Deal policies during the Great Depression. The document focuses on regulating alcohol and alcoholic beverages, giving the Administration broad powers to investigate, study, and prescribe rules. It also allocates a significant sum of money ($500,000) for the Administration's operations. The document does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It does expand executive power by creating a new agency and granting it broad authority. It also centralizes control at the federal level. It involves government intervention in the economy through regulation of alcohol. It does not directly address ideological tilt. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
