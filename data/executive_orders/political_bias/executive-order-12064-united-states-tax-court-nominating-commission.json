    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to assist the President in filling vacancies on the United States Tax Court. It seems fairly neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by creating this commission, but it also delegates some functions to the Secretary of the Treasury, which could be seen as a slight restraint. It also involves both federal and state agencies, suggesting a cooperative balance in federalism.",
