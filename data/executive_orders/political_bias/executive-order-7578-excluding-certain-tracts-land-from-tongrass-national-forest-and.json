    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding land use in Alaska in 1937. It transfers small parcels of land from the Tongass National Forest back to public land status for homesteading. This action has minimal implications for most of the axes. It could be argued that making land available for private ownership reflects a slight move towards deregulation. The action itself is fairly neutral regarding ideology, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, and social inclusion.",
