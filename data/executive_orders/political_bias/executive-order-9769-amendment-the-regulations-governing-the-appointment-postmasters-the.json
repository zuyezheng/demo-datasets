    "critique": "This document pertains to an amendment regarding the compensation limit for postmasters of the fourth class, impacting their appointment process within the Civil Service Rules. It raises the limit from $500 to $1000. This change seems primarily administrative, with limited implications for broader political or ideological concerns. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The increase in the compensation limit could be seen as a slight intervention in economic matters, but it's minimal.",
