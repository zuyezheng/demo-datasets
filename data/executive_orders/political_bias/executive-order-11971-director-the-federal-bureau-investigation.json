    "critique": "This executive order establishes a committee to select the Director of the FBI. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It could be argued that establishing a committee adds a layer of bureaucracy and thus slightly expands executive power, although it also constrains the president's choice to the committee's recommendations. It doesn't significantly impact federalism or national security vs. civil liberties. It also doesn't directly promote or hinder social inclusion.",
