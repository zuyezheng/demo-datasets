    "critique": "This document establishes the Carolina Sandhills Wildlife Refuge. It was created using land acquired under the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935. The land was transferred to the Secretary of Agriculture and is now being reserved as a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife. Hunting, trapping, or disturbing wildlife within the refuge is prohibited, and entry is regulated by the Secretary of Agriculture. The creation of a wildlife refuge could be seen as slightly liberal in its ideological tilt, as it prioritizes environmental conservation. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in this document. Therefore, these axes should be scored as neutral.",
