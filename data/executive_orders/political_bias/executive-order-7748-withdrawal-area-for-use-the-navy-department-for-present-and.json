    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1937 that withdraws land in Alaska for use by the Navy Department. It does not touch on ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It expands executive power insofar as it is an executive order, but this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that it can be revoked by the President or Congress. It favors federal power over state power, as it is a federal action concerning land. It has no impact on economic regulation or social inclusion.",
