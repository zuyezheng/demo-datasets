It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The creation of a board could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it is primarily an act of mediation.",
