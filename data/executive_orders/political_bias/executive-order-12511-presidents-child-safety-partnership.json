    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's Child Safety Partnership to examine issues and make recommendations on preventing child victimization. It encourages public-private cooperation and does not appear to strongly lean in any particular ideological direction. Immigration is not addressed, so it is neutral. The order establishes a partnership and does not significantly expand executive power. It does not obviously shift power between state and federal entities. It balances security and liberty by focusing on child safety without infringing on civil liberties. It does not directly regulate the economy. It promotes social inclusion by aiming to protect children, a vulnerable group.",
