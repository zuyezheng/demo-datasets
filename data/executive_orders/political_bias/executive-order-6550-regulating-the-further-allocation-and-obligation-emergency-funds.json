    "critique": "This executive order mandates that all executive departments and agencies (excluding the Treasury Department and certain pre-1932 corporations) submit weekly reports to the Director of the Budget regarding allocations and obligations of emergency funds. The Director of the Budget is then tasked with compiling these reports and making recommendations to the President. This seems to be about increasing transparency and oversight of emergency spending during the Great Depression. There's nothing inherently liberal or conservative about this; it's more about efficient governance. It doesn't directly impact immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it slightly increases government intervention in the economy by increasing oversight of spending, but it's a very indirect effect. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
