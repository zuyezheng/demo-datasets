This seems to be an administrative action to fulfill treaty obligations. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 0.",
