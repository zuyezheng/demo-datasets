    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the retirement of colonels in the Regular Army and the Regular Air Force. It adjusts the dates for suspension of certain provisions of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. Given the subject matter, the document has little bearing on ideological tilt, immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does not obviously expand executive power, as it is an amendment within existing legislation. It also doesn't significantly impact federalism. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
