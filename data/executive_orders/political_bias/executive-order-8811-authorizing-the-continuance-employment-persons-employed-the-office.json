It ensures job security for existing employees and provides a pathway to competitive classified civil service status. It also protects the rights of those who leave for military service. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion/exclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
