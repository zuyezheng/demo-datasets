    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1936 exempting a carpenter from mandatory retirement. It's a very specific, targeted action with minimal broader implications. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, federalism, security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis with any relevance is executive power, and even there, it's a limited, justifiable use of existing authority granted by Congress.",
