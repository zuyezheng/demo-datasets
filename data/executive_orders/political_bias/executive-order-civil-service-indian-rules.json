    "critique": "The document outlines rules for the classified Indian service, focusing on employment and examination procedures. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, or social inclusion. The document leans towards federal control due to the establishment of a federal Indian service. It also balances security and liberty by setting standards for employment while providing avenues for appeal. Economic regulation is present through the establishment of employment standards and procedures.",
