    "critique": "This document is an executive order withdrawing public lands from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The withdrawal of land could be seen as a slight intervention in economic activity, but it's primarily for administrative purposes related to land management.",
