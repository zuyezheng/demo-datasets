    "critique": "This executive order transfers authority regarding reimbursements for the protection of foreign missions from the Department of Treasury to the Secretary of State. It does not seem to have a strong ideological leaning, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order simply streamlines administrative processes related to foreign missions.",
