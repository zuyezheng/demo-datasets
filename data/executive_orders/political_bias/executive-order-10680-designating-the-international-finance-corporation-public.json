    "critique": "The document designates the International Finance Corporation as a public international organization, granting it certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. This suggests a cooperative approach to international finance and a willingness to cede some authority to international bodies. The document doesn't explicitly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion, so the initial scores are set to neutral (0) for these categories. The revised scores reflect a slight move towards federal control and economic intervention due to the designation's implications for international cooperation and financial regulation.",
