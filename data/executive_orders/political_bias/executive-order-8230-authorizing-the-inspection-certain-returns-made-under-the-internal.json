    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1939 regarding the inspection of tax returns. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order simply opens tax returns for inspection according to existing rules and regulations. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0). However, the act of opening up tax returns for inspection could be seen as a slight move towards government intervention, so a small positive score for economic regulation might be appropriate.",
