It directs the Secretary of Education to supervise the development of a Federal program to achieve this goal, identify and eliminate barriers to participation, and involve private sector institutions. It also requires each Executive Department and designated agencies to establish annual plans with measurable objectives and submit progress reports. The order emphasizes equal opportunity and aims to address past discriminatory treatment.",
