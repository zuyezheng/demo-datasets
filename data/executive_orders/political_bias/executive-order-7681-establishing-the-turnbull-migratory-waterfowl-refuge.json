It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power in a controversial way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The executive order does expand executive power a bit, but it is a fairly standard use of that power.",
