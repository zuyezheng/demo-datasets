    "critique": "This executive order from 1971, signed by Richard Nixon, amends Executive Order No. 10450 from 1953. It focuses on defining and identifying organizations deemed 'totalitarian', 'fascist', 'communist', or 'subversive'. The order grants the Subversive Activities Control Board the authority to conduct hearings and designate such organizations based on specific criteria, including advocating violence, seeking to overthrow the government, or engaging in activities that suppress opposition. The order also revokes Executive Order No. 9835. The context is the Cold War era, with heightened concerns about internal threats to national security. The language is legalistic and precise, defining specific terms and outlining procedures for identifying and designating subversive organizations. The order leans conservative due to its focus on national security and anti-communist sentiment. It expands executive power by granting broad authority to the Subversive Activities Control Board. It also centralizes power at the federal level. It prioritizes national security over civil liberties by potentially targeting organizations based on their political beliefs. It does not directly address economic regulation, immigration, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
