It aims to ensure that disruption or manipulation of PNT services does not undermine the functioning of critical infrastructure. The order outlines a series of actions for various federal departments and agencies to develop PNT profiles, test vulnerabilities, incorporate PNT requirements into federal contracts, and promote the responsible use of PNT services. It also calls for the development of a national plan for research and development of additional PNT services and a GNSS-independent source of Coordinated Universal Time.",
