    "critique": "This document establishes a migratory bird refuge in Idaho. It withdraws certain islands in the Snake River from settlement, sale, or entry, reserving them for the Department of Agriculture. This action aims to protect migratory birds and other wildlife. There is no direct impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to environmental conservation efforts.",
