    "critique": "This document delegates authority related to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation in a significant way, or social inclusion. The delegation to the Civil Service Commission and the Secretary of State seems fairly neutral in terms of these axes.",
