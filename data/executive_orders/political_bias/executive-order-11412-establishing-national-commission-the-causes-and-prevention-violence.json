    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to investigate the causes and prevention of violence. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The establishment of a commission could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's primarily an investigative body.",
