    "critique": "This document is a short executive order that waives civil service rules to appoint a specific person, Mrs. Kathleen M. Glancy, to a clerical position in the Department of Justice. The rationale is that she is the widow of a long-time Justice Department employee who died, leaving her and her three young children without support. The order is recommended by the Attorney General.\n\nIdeological Tilt: The document is not explicitly ideological. It is a compassionate measure to support a widow and her children. Score: 0\nImmigration Approach: The document has nothing to do with immigration. Score: 0\nExecutive Power: The document uses executive power to waive civil service rules in a specific case. This is a slight expansion of executive power, but it is limited to a specific situation. Score: 1\nFederalism: The document does not address federalism. Score: 0\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The document does not address national security or civil liberties. Score: 0\nEconomic Regulation: The document does not address economic regulation. Score: 0\nSocial Inclusion: The document could be seen as promoting social inclusion by providing support to a widow and her children. However, it is a specific case and not a general policy. Score: 1\n\nRevised Scores:\nIdeological Tilt: 0\nImmigration Approach: 0\nExecutive Power: 1\nFederalism: 0\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0\nEconomic Regulation: 0\nSocial Inclusion: 1",
