It sets limits on interest rates, declares contracts violating these limits void for the interest amount, allows recovery of usurious interest, and requires verification of usury claims. There is no explicit information available regarding immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, or social inclusion. Therefore, these axes are set to a neutral score.",
