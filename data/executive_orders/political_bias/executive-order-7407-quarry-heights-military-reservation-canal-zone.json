    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 that establishes a military reservation in the Canal Zone. It primarily deals with land allocation and jurisdictional control. There is little to no information about ideological tilt, immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document does expand executive power by creating the reservation, and it leans towards federal control over the Canal Zone.",
