    "critique": "This executive order concerns regulations for payment of losses sustained by US officers and employees in foreign countries due to currency appreciation. It aims to provide relief by reimbursing losses incurred when converting salary and allowances into foreign currencies. The order defines who is eligible, the purpose of the act, and the method for calculating and paying losses. It also specifies basic exchange rates and allows for future modifications. There is nothing about ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. It does involve economic regulation by providing for reimbursement of losses due to currency fluctuations.",
