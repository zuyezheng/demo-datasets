    "critique": "This is an executive order that makes an exception to the Civil Service Retirement Act for Frances Perkins. It allows her to continue working past the age of compulsory retirement. This seems like a fairly neutral action. There's no clear ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on federalism. It doesn't obviously expand executive power, as it's based on existing law. It doesn't directly address national security or economic regulation. It could be argued that retaining an experienced civil servant promotes social good, but it's not explicitly about diversity or inclusion.",
