    "critique": "This document pertains to the transfer of control of an airport to the Secretary of War for military purposes during World War II. It is a straightforward administrative action with minimal ideological content. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The exception might be security vs. liberty, where a slight tilt towards security is warranted due to the context of wartime and military control.",
