It outlines specific criteria related to work-study programs, work experience, agency recommendations, and Civil Service Commission requirements. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion or restriction, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion/exclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
