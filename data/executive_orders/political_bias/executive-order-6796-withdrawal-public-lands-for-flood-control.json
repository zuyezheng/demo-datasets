    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that withdraws public lands in Utah from settlement, location, sale, or entry. The land is reserved for flood-control work undertaken by the Department of Agriculture under the Emergency Unemployment Relief Act of 1933. This seems like a moderate intervention in the economy to provide relief during the Great Depression. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the government intervention in the economy to provide relief.",
