    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1929 that withdraws land on Gravina Island, Alaska to protect the water supply of a marine station of the Department of Agriculture. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It is a conservation effort, but it is difficult to say whether this is liberal or conservative. It does not deal with immigration. It is difficult to say whether this expands executive power, as it is a relatively minor action. It could be argued that it centralizes power in the federal government, but it is a very minor action. It does not deal with national security or civil liberties. It could be argued that it is a form of economic regulation, but it is a very minor action. It does not deal with social inclusion.",
