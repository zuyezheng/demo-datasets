    "critique": "This document is an executive order from Franklin D. Roosevelt addressing homework within the context of the National Industrial Recovery Act. It aims to balance the abolition of homework with the needs of individuals incapacitated for factory work or those required to care for invalids. The order allows homework under specific conditions, including certification and wage parity with factory workers. It also includes provisions for record-keeping and limitations on its applicability to food-related industries. \n\nIdeological Tilt: The document reflects a moderate liberal approach (+2) by addressing social welfare concerns and attempting to provide employment opportunities for vulnerable populations. However, it also operates within the framework of the National Industrial Recovery Act, which involved significant government intervention in the economy.\n\nImmigration Approach: The document does not directly address immigration, so it receives a neutral score (0).\n\nExecutive Power: The document expands executive power (+3) as it is an executive order that modifies existing codes of fair competition under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It demonstrates the President's authority to issue regulations and conditions on previously approved codes.\n\nFederalism: The document leans towards federal primacy (+2) as it involves the federal government (specifically the Department of Labor) in setting standards and issuing instructions for state authorities regarding homework certification.\n\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The document does not directly address national security or civil liberties, so it receives a neutral score (0).\n\nEconomic Regulation: The document involves government intervention in economic matters (+3) by regulating homework and setting wage standards. It operates within the broader context of the National Industrial Recovery Act, which aimed to regulate industries and promote economic recovery.\n\nSocial Inclusion: The document promotes social inclusion (+2) by attempting to provide employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities or those caring for invalids. It aims to ensure that these individuals are not excluded from the workforce due to the abolition of homework.\n\nRevised Scores:\n\nIdeological Tilt: +2\nImmigration Approach: 0\nExecutive Power: +3\nFederalism: +2\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0\nEconomic Regulation: +3\nSocial Inclusion: +2",
