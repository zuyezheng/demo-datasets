    "critique": "This document designates San Luis, Arizona as a port of entry in 1930. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It has a slight impact on immigration by designating a port of entry. It could be argued that designating a port of entry expands executive power, but this is a very minor effect. It has a slight impact on federalism, as it is a federal designation affecting a state. It has no impact on national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
