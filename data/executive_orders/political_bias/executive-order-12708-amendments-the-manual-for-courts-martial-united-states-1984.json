    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1984. It addresses procedural changes, definitions, and clarifications within the military justice system. There is no direct discussion or implication related to immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes are neutral. The document does not express a clear ideological tilt.",
