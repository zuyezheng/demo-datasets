    "critique": "This document primarily concerns amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial, focusing on procedural and technical aspects of military justice. It does not directly address broad ideological themes, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document does not seem to obviously expand executive power, as it is an amendment to existing procedures. It also doesn't obviously favor state or federal primacy. It seems to have a neutral impact on national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion.",
