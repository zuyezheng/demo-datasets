    "critique": "This document pertains to the filling of a vacancy for a teller position in the New York customs office in 1888. It discusses whether the position should be filled through a standard competitive examination or a noncompetitive examination due to the specific skills required (handling money, detecting counterfeits). The Civil Service Commission recommends a noncompetitive examination for this specific instance, without setting a precedent. There is little to no information about ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
