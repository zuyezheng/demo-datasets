    "critique": "This document pertains to the withdrawal of public lands in Colorado from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. It cites specific acts of Congress as its authority. Given the subject matter, the document has minimal ideological content. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The action itself could be construed as a form of government intervention, but it is very limited and specific, so a slightly negative score seems appropriate.",
