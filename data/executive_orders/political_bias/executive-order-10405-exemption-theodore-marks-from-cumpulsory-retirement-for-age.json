    "critique": "This is an executive order that exempts a specific individual from mandatory retirement. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, or social inclusion. It arguably expands executive power slightly by making an exception to a general rule, but it's a very minor expansion. It doesn't relate to federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation.",
