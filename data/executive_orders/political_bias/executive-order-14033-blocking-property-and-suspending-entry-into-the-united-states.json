    "critique": "This executive order expands on previous orders related to the Western Balkans, focusing on blocking property and restricting entry of individuals involved in actions threatening peace, security, or democratic processes in the region. It targets corruption, human rights abuses, and obstruction of agreements. The order broadens executive power through IEEPA and the NEA, centralizes authority in the federal government, and prioritizes national security and foreign policy interests. It restricts immigration for those deemed detrimental to U.S. interests. The order doesn't directly address economic regulation or social inclusion within the U.S., but its focus on anti-corruption and supporting democratic governance could be seen as indirectly promoting certain values.",
