    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and aims to establish procedures for notifying submitters of confidential commercial information when their records are requested under FOIA. It seeks to balance transparency with the protection of business interests. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it slightly restrains executive power by mandating notification procedures, but it also reinforces federal control over information management. It leans towards protecting commercial interests, which could be seen as a slight deregulation aspect. It doesn't directly impact national security vs. civil liberties. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
