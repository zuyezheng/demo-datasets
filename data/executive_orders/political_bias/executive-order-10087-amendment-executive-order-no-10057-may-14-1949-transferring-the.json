    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the administration of overseas military cemeteries and the transfer of functions and funds from the Department of the Army to the American Battle Monuments Commission. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The transfer of functions could be seen as a very slight shift towards federal control, but it's primarily an administrative matter.",
