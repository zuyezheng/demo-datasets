    "critique": "This executive order establishes an advisory committee on women's business ownership. \n\n1.  Ideological Tilt: This promotes women in business, which aligns with modern liberal values of equality and opportunity. However, it doesn't explicitly address broader social issues, so it's moderately liberal. Score: +2\n2.  Immigration Approach: The document doesn't mention immigration. Score: 0\n3.  Executive Power: It establishes a committee, but it doesn't significantly expand or restrict executive power. It delegates some functions to the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, which is a neutral action. Score: 0\n4.  Federalism: The order involves the federal government in supporting women's businesses, which could be seen as a slight shift towards federal control. Score: +1\n5.  National Security vs. Civil Liberties: The document doesn't touch upon national security or civil liberties. Score: 0\n6.  Economic Regulation: It aims to foster financial support for women entrepreneurs, which implies some government intervention in the economy, but it's not heavy-handed. Score: +1\n7.  Social Inclusion: The order explicitly focuses on women, promoting their inclusion in business. Score: +3\n\nRevised Scores:\n- Ideological Tilt: +2\n- Immigration Approach: 0\n- Executive Power: 0\n- Federalism: +1\n- National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0\n- Economic Regulation: +1\n- Social Inclusion: +3",
