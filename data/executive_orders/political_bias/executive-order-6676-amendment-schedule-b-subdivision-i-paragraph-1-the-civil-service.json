    "critique": "This executive order pertains to an exception to civil service rules for positions in the Indian Service, specifically for applicants of one-fourth or more Indian blood. It is difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt (liberal vs. conservative) based on this order alone, so I will assign a 0. The order seems neutral regarding immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, and economic regulation, so I will assign 0 for these. Regarding social inclusion, the order could be seen as promoting inclusion by creating opportunities for individuals of Indian blood, but it also singles out a specific group based on ancestry, so I will assign a 1.",
