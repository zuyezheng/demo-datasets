    "critique": "This document concerns travel regulations for members of the uniformed services called to active duty. It specifies how travel time is calculated and included as active duty, differentiating between public and private transportation. There's no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or impacts on civil liberties. It delegates authority to the Secretaries concerned for supplementary regulations, promoting uniformity across services. The order does not obviously expand executive power, but rather implements existing legislation. It doesn't directly address economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
