    "critique": "This document outlines the policy regarding passports for paroled prisoners and other individuals implicated in a rebellion. It stipulates that paroled prisoners can receive passports under the condition they do not return to the US without presidential permission. Other implicated individuals' applications will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Here's a breakdown of the scores:\n\n1. Ideological Tilt: 0. This document doesn't strongly align with either liberal or conservative ideologies. It's more about post-rebellion governance and doesn't touch on typical left-right issues.\n2. Immigration Approach: -1. It's slightly restrictive as it places conditions on the return of paroled prisoners.\n3. Executive Power: +2. It expands executive power because it requires individuals to seek presidential permission to return to the US.\n4. Federalism: 0. The document doesn't significantly shift power between state and federal entities.\n5. National Security vs. Civil Liberties: +1. It leans slightly towards national security by restricting the movement of individuals implicated in a rebellion.\n6. Economic Regulation: 0. The document has no bearing on economic regulation.\n7. Social Inclusion: 0. It doesn't directly address social inclusion or diversity.",
