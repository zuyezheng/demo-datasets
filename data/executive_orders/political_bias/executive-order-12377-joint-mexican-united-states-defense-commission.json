    "critique": "This document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, adding a Marine Corps member to the Joint Mexican-United States Defense Commission. It primarily concerns military organization and cooperation between the US and Mexico. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. The change does not significantly expand executive power or alter the balance of federalism. It has no direct economic or social inclusion implications. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
