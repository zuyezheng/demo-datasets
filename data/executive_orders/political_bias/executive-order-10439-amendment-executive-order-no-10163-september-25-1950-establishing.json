    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the Armed Forces Reserve Medal and amends a previous order (No. 10163) from 1950. It clarifies eligibility requirements for the medal, focusing on years of service in reserve components. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It has a slight impact on executive power, as it modifies a previous order, but it doesn't drastically expand or restrict it. It doesn't significantly impact federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards expanding executive power due to the amendment.",
