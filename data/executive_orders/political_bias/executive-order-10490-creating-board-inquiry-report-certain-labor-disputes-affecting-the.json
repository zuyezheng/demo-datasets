    "critique": "This document establishes a Board of Inquiry to address labor disputes in the maritime industry, invoking the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, or social inclusion. The executive power is moderately expanded to address a specific labor issue deemed to affect national health and safety. Federalism isn't significantly impacted. National security is indirectly addressed through the lens of economic stability. Economic regulation is moderately interventionist to resolve labor disputes. There is no direct impact on social inclusion.",
