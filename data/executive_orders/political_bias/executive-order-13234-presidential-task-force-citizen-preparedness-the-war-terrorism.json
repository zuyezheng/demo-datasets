    "critique": "This executive order establishes a task force on citizen preparedness in the war on terrorism. It is signed by George W. Bush in 2001. The order itself is fairly neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, economic regulation, and social inclusion. It does expand executive power slightly by creating a task force, and it leans towards national security by focusing on preparedness in the war on terrorism.",
