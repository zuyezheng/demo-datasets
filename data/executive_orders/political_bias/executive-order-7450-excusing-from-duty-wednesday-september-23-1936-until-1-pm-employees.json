    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 excusing government employees in Washington D.C. from duty until 1 P.M. on September 23, 1936, to honor Civil War veterans during a Grand Army of the Republic parade. It does not touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Its ideological tilt is neutral, as honoring veterans is a non-partisan issue. Therefore, most scores should be zero.",
