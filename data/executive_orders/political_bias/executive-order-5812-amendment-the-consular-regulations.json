It mandates the use of official funds for official business only and requires a strict accounting of postage. There is no apparent ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power grab, federalism issue, security vs. liberty concern, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspect to this document. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
