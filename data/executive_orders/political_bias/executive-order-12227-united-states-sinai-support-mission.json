    "critique": "This document amends a previous executive order related to the implementation of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. It primarily concerns the role of a U.S. mission in verifying zones and installations as part of the treaty. There's no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, or economic regulation. It touches upon national security in the context of international peace efforts and doesn't seem to expand executive power significantly beyond its existing scope. Federalism and social inclusion are not directly addressed. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight positive score for national security due to its focus on international peace and verification.",
