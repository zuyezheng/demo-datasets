    "critique": "This document modifies the boundaries of a military reservation at Fort Washakie, Wyoming, taking into account the interests of the local Indian population. It's primarily a technical adjustment related to land use and doesn't directly address broader political or ideological issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document explicitly acknowledges and protects the rights of the Indians, which suggests a slight lean towards social inclusion.",
