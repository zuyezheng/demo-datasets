    "critique": "The document primarily concerns the modification of the Fort Washakie military reservation boundaries based on a survey, with consideration for Native American land rights. It does not express explicit opinions on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral. The only exception is federalism, which leans slightly towards federal control due to the executive order modifying the reservation.",
