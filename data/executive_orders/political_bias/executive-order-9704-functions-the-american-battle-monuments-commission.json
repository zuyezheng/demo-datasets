    "critique": "The document focuses on the control and supervision of memorial monuments and buildings in American cemeteries located outside of the United States. It grants the American Battle Monuments Commission the authority to regulate the erection of these memorials, both in American cemeteries and in foreign countries where American armed forces have served. There is no direct discussion of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral.",
