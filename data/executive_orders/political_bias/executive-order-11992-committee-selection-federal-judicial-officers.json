    "critique": "This executive order establishes a committee to assist the President in selecting Federal judicial officers (excluding Circuit and District judges). It outlines the committee's functions, procedures, and limitations. There's nothing inherently liberal or conservative about establishing such a committee. The order doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties, or economic regulation. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by creating a mechanism for the President to receive recommendations for judicial appointments, but it also constrains that power by requiring the committee to follow procedures and criteria set by the President or Attorney General. It centralizes the selection process at the federal level. There's no mention of social inclusion or exclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
