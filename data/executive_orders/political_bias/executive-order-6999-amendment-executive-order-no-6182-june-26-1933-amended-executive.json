    "critique": "This executive order from 1935 transfers certain powers related to agricultural codes of fair competition from the Secretary of Agriculture to the National Industrial Recovery Board, with some limitations to avoid conflict with the Agricultural Adjustment Act. It seems to be an internal adjustment of responsibilities within the executive branch during the New Deal era. Ideological Tilt: The document reflects the interventionist policies of the New Deal, which is generally considered liberal for its time. Immigration Approach: The document does not address immigration. Executive Power: The document involves a transfer of power within the executive branch, but it doesn't drastically expand or restrict executive power overall. Federalism: The document seems to centralize power at the federal level, as it deals with national industries and their regulation. National Security vs. Civil Liberties: The document does not directly address national security or civil liberties. Economic Regulation: The document clearly promotes economic intervention and regulation, as it deals with codes of fair competition and price controls. Social Inclusion: The document does not directly address social inclusion.
