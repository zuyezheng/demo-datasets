    "critique": "This document establishes the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1984. It primarily deals with military justice and procedures within the armed forces. It does not directly address immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a broader societal context. The document rescinds a previous executive order and mandates annual revisions by the Secretary of Defense, suggesting a structured and ongoing process. The document itself doesn't inherently expand executive power, but rather provides a framework for military legal proceedings. It also doesn't directly impact federalism or the balance between national security and civil liberties outside of the military context. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
