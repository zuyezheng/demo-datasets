    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the observation of elections in Greece in 1945. It is difficult to assess its position on the traditional left-right political spectrum. It does not directly address immigration. It could be argued that sending representatives abroad expands executive power, but it is also in line with the responsibilities of the President. It does not directly address federalism. It does not directly address national security vs. civil liberties. It does not directly address economic regulation. It promotes social inclusion by supporting free elections in another country.",
