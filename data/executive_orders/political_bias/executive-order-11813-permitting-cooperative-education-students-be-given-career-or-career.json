    "critique": "This document establishes a program for cooperative education within the Federal Government, allowing students to combine academic study with work experience in Federal agencies. It outlines the conditions under which a cooperative education student's appointment can be converted to a career-conditional or career appointment. The order delegates authority to the Civil Service Commission to prescribe regulations for the program's implementation and evaluation. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion, so most scores are neutral. The slight positive score for economic regulation reflects the government's role in creating and regulating this program.",
