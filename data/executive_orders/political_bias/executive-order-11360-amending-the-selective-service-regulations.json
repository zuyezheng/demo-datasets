    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending the Selective Service Regulations. It primarily deals with administrative and procedural changes related to the draft, including updates to registration requirements, classification rules, and appeal processes. There is a slight tilt towards expanding executive power, as it reinforces the authority of the Selective Service and the Secretary of Defense in determining manpower needs. The document does not directly address immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It has a moderate impact on national security versus civil liberties, as it strengthens the draft system, potentially impacting individual liberties in the name of national security. The document does not seem to have a strong ideological leaning.",
