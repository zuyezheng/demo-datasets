    "critique": "This executive order focuses on a government-wide approach to combatting COVID-19 through increased testing, workforce development, and ensuring free testing access. It establishes a COVID-19 Pandemic Testing Board to coordinate efforts and provides support to state, local, tribal, and territorial authorities. The order also aims to address the cost of testing and establish a public health workforce program. It seems to expand federal involvement in public health matters, but also emphasizes coordination with state and local entities. There is no mention of immigration. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the focus on government intervention in healthcare and social welfare. It does not seem to touch on civil liberties or conformity vs diversity. It expands executive power by creating new boards and programs.",
