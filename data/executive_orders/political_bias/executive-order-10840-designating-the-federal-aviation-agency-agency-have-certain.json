    "critique": "The document expands the power of the executive branch by designating the Federal Aviation Agency as an agency to which certain statutory provisions apply, mirroring the powers of the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the Atomic Energy Commission. This concentrates power at the federal level and potentially reduces state control. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
