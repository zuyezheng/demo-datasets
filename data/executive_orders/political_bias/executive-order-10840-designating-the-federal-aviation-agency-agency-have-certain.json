    "critique": "This document is a designation of the Federal Aviation Agency under the Assignment of Claims Act. It appears to be a technical adjustment to allow the FAA to be treated similarly to other agencies regarding contract payments. There is no immediately obvious ideological tilt. It does not directly address immigration. It could be argued that designating an agency under this act expands executive power, but it is a very minor expansion. It does not seem to have a direct impact on federalism. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It does not directly regulate the economy. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
