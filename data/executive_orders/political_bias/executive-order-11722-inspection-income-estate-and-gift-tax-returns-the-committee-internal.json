    "critique": "This document is an executive order that allows the House Committee on Internal Security to inspect income, estate, or gift tax returns for the years 1964 to 1974. This could be seen as an expansion of executive power, as it allows the executive branch to grant access to private tax information. It also leans towards prioritizing national security over civil liberties, as it allows the government to investigate individuals' financial records. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
