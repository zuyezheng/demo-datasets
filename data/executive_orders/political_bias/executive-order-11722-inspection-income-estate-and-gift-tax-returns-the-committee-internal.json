    "critique": "The document grants the House Committee on Internal Security the authority to inspect income, estate, or gift tax returns from 1964 to 1974. This raises concerns about potential government overreach and infringement on privacy rights. The order doesn't specify clear limitations on the use of this information, increasing the risk of abuse. The focus on internal security suggests a prioritization of security over individual liberties.",
