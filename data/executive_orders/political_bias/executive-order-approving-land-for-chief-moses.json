    "critique": "This executive order establishes a reservation for Chief Moses and his people. This action suggests a recognition of indigenous rights, which leans slightly liberal. The order withdraws land from sale, indicating some government intervention in land use, but it's primarily for the purpose of creating a reservation. The order doesn't explicitly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, most of these axes should be neutral.",
