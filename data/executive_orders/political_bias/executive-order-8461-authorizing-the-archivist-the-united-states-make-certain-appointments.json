    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding appointments within the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library. It allows the Archivist to bypass Civil Service Act requirements for two specific positions. This could be seen as a minor expansion of executive power, although it's primarily an administrative matter. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
