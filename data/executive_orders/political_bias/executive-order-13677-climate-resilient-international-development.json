    "critique": "This executive order focuses on integrating climate resilience into international development programs. It aims to ensure that U.S. investments and assistance consider the impacts of climate change in vulnerable countries. The order establishes a working group to develop guidelines and share knowledge, promoting interagency collaboration and monitoring progress. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation in a significant way. The order promotes social inclusion by addressing climate change which disproportionately affects vulnerable populations.",
