    "critique": "This document is a withdrawal of public lands in New Mexico from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation, pending a resurvey of said township. It cites the act of June 25, 1910, as amended by the act of August 24, 1912, and the act of March 3, 1909. There is nothing to suggest any ideological tilt. There is nothing about immigration. The order can be revoked by the President or Congress, so it is neutral on executive power. It is neutral on federalism. It is neutral on national security vs. civil liberties. It is neutral on economic regulation. It is neutral on social inclusion.",
