    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending a previous executive order regarding housing allowances for members of the uniformed services. It primarily deals with the specifics of who is eligible for housing allowances under what circumstances. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, or impact on civil liberties. It does not seem to expand executive power, but rather clarifies existing regulations. It does not obviously shift power between state and federal governments. It has a very minor impact on economic regulation by clarifying housing allowances. It does not seem to have any impact on social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
