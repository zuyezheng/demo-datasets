    "critique": "This document concerns the retrocession of jurisdiction over Native American affairs from the federal government to the states. It delegates authority to the Secretary of the Interior to handle these matters, with certain stipulations regarding publication and consultation with the Attorney General. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt without further context, but it appears to be an administrative action related to federalism and Native American affairs. Immigration, security/liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion are not directly addressed in this document. The primary focus seems to be on the balance of power between the federal government and the states regarding jurisdiction over Native American affairs and delegation of power. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
