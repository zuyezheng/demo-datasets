    "critique": "This executive order pertains to closing federal offices for half a day on Christmas Eve. It seems largely apolitical, with the exception of Section 2, which allows heads of departments to keep certain offices open for national security or other essential public reasons. This could be interpreted as a slight leaning towards national security, but it's very mild. The order does not touch on immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
