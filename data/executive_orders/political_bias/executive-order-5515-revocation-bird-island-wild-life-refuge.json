    "critique": "This document revokes an executive order that set aside an island as a refuge for wild animals and birds. It's a simple reversal of a previous decision. There's no clear ideological tilt, immigration aspect, expansion of executive power, or impact on national security vs. civil liberties. It has a very slight impact on economic regulation as it relates to land use, and a very slight negative impact on social inclusion as it removes a protected area for wildlife.",
