    "critique": "This document is an executive order that terminates the powers of the Special Mexican Claims Commission, as the commission has completed its work. It does not touch upon immigration, civil liberties, or economic regulation. It is a simple administrative action. Therefore, most of the axes should be neutral. The executive power is slightly expanded as the president is terminating the commission.",
