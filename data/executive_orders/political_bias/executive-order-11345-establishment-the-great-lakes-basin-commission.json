    "critique": "This document establishes the Great Lakes Basin Commission. It seems to be a fairly standard executive order, so I will score it accordingly. It is hard to find much ideological content here. It does involve multiple states, so it is hard to say whether it favors state or federal primacy. It does not seem to touch on immigration, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
