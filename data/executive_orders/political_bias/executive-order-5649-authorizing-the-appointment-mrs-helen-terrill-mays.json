    "critique": "The document discusses the appointment of Mrs. Helen Terrill Mays to a clerical position in the Treasury Department without compliance with civil-service rules. This is justified by her being the widow of a former prohibition administrator who died, leaving her without support. She has also served temporarily and satisfactorily in the Bureau of Industrial Alcohol. The document reflects a focus on providing support to the widow of a government employee and valuing her past service.",
