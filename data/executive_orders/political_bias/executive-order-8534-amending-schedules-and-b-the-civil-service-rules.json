    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending Schedules A and B of the Civil Service Rules. It details positions excepted from competitive examination or which may be filled upon noncompetitive examination. Because it deals with the structure of the civil service, it does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It does not seem to expand executive power significantly, as it is simply modifying existing rules. It does not obviously favor state or federal primacy. It has little impact on economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
