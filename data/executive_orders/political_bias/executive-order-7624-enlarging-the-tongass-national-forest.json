    "critique": "This document pertains to the inclusion of a tract of public land in Alaska into the Tongass National Forest. It is a straightforward administrative action, with no immediately obvious political or ideological implications. It references specific acts and surveys, indicating a legal and technical process. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. There's a slight lean towards federalism as it expands a national forest, and a very slight lean towards economic regulation as it potentially restricts land use for economic activity.",
