    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1932 that exempts specific individuals from mandatory retirement. It's a very specific action with limited scope. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any significant way. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
