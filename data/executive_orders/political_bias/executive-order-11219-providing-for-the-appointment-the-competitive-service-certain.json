It aims to streamline the process for qualified individuals to transition between these services, specifying eligibility criteria, appointment types (career conditional vs. career), and service requirements. The order also addresses competitive status acquisition and disqualification factors. The document does not explicitly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral.",
