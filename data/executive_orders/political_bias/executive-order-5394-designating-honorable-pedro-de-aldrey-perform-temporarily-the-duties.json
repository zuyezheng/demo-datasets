    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the temporary replacement of a judge in Puerto Rico. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, economic regulation, social inclusion, or national security vs. civil liberties. It slightly expands executive power by designating a replacement judge, and it leans towards federal control as it involves a federal judge in Puerto Rico.",
