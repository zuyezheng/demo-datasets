    "critique": "This document is an executive order approving an official flag for the United States Army. It also describes the flag and authorizes campaign streamers to be displayed on the flagstaff. There is nothing in this document that suggests a particular ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power dynamic, federalism stance, national security vs. civil liberties concern, economic regulation, or social inclusion preference. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
