    "critique": "This document is an executive order establishing service ribbons for the Coast and Geodetic Survey during World War II. It primarily concerns military honors and administrative procedures. There is little to no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or social inclusion. The order delegates authority to the Secretary of Commerce, but this does not inherently expand executive power in a significant way. It does not directly address federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
