    "critique": "This is an executive order that extends the exemption of a special agent from compulsory retirement. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, economic regulation, and social inclusion based on this document. The document expands executive power by allowing the president to further exempt an individual from compulsory retirement. It also leans towards national security by retaining a special agent.",
