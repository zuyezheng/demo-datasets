It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It expands executive power by implementing the Selective Service Act. It centralizes control at the federal level. It prioritizes national security by ensuring the availability of medical personnel for the armed forces. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
