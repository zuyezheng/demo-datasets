    "critique": "This executive order targets North Korea's government and affiliated entities due to their destabilizing actions and human rights abuses. It blocks assets, prohibits transactions, and suspends entry into the U.S. for individuals and entities associated with North Korea. It expands executive power to address a national emergency. There is a slight tilt towards national security over individual liberties of those associated with the North Korean regime. It doesn't directly address domestic economic regulation or social inclusion within the US. It restricts immigration of those affiliated with North Korea.",
