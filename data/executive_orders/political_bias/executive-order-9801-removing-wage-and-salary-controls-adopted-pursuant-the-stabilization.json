    "critique": "This executive order terminates wage and salary controls that were put in place during World War II under the Stabilization Act of 1942. This indicates a move towards deregulation and a free market economy. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power expansion, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. The order simply removes wartime economic controls.",
