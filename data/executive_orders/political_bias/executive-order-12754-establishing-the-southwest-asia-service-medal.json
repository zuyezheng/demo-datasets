    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Southwest Asia Service Medal for military operations in Southwest Asia. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only exception might be national security, which could be seen as slightly prioritized, but it's a stretch.",
