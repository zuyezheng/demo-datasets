    "critique": "This document is a presidential order to appoint Mrs. Helen Hall York as a clerk in the Treasury Department, bypassing civil service rules. This is due to her being the widow of a former Prohibition Agent who died in the line of duty, leaving her with three children and without sufficient support. The Secretary of the Treasury recommended this order.\n\n1.  Ideological Tilt: 0. This is a compassionate measure to support the family of a fallen officer. It doesn't strongly align with either liberal or conservative ideologies.\n2.  Immigration Approach: 0. This document has nothing to do with immigration.\n3.  Executive Power: 3. The document expands executive power by bypassing civil service rules for a specific appointment. While it's a sympathetic case, it sets a precedent for executive intervention in standard procedures.\n4.  Federalism: 0. The document doesn't significantly impact the balance between state and federal power.\n5.  National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0. While it relates to the widow of a Prohibition Agent, it doesn't directly address national security or civil liberties.\n6.  Economic Regulation: 0. The document doesn't deal with economic regulation.\n7.  Social Inclusion: 1. It shows a degree of social inclusion by providing support to a widow and her children, acknowledging their vulnerable situation.\n\nRevised Scores:\nI have slightly adjusted the executive power score to reflect the specific nature of the order. While it does expand executive power, it is a limited and compassionate case.",
