    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1936 exempting Henry Blackwood, Assistant Collector of Customs, from mandatory retirement. It cites a provision allowing the President to do so when in the public interest. The order itself doesn't express strong opinions on most political axes, but the act of granting an exemption could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power.",
