    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1936 that allows one person to continue in their role despite having reached the retirement age. The document itself is neutral regarding ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. It does expand executive power slightly, as it uses the President's authority to make an exception to a rule.",
