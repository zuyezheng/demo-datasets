    "critique": "This executive order mandates earthquake safety standards for new federal buildings and federally assisted construction. It aims to reduce risks to lives and protect public investments in a cost-effective manner. The order promotes the use of nationally recognized private sector standards and practices, unless an agency finds that none is available that meets its requirements. It also encourages grantees and subgrantees to adopt these standards even when federal funding is not involved. The order does not appear to have a strong ideological tilt, as it focuses on safety and risk reduction. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral.",
