    "critique": "The document designates the International Cotton Institute as a public international organization, granting it various immunities and privileges. This suggests a cooperative international approach and a focus on facilitating international trade and collaboration in the cotton industry. There is no apparent ideological tilt, immigration stance, or emphasis on executive power. The document leans towards federalism by designating an international organization. It also shows a balance between security and liberty by granting immunities while allowing legal proceedings in certain cases. The document promotes economic regulation by granting privileges, exemptions, and immunities concerning customs duties and taxes. There is no clear indication of social inclusion or exclusion.",
