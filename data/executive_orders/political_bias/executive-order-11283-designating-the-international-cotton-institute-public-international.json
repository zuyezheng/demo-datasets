    "critique": "This document designates the International Cotton Institute as a public international organization, granting it certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. It's primarily an administrative action, so its ideological tilt is neutral. It has a slight impact on immigration due to the provisions for representatives and employees of the Institute, but it's not a major focus. The executive power is somewhat expanded as it's an executive order, but it's based on existing legislation. Federalism is not significantly affected. National security vs. civil liberties is balanced, with some immunity granted but also provisions for members to deny entry. Economic regulation is not directly addressed, but the Institute's operations could have some indirect effects. Social inclusion is neutral. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration: 1, Executive Power: 1, Federalism: 0, Security/Liberty: 0, Economic Regulation: 0, Social Inclusion: 0. Upon further reflection, the immigration score should be lower as the document only addresses immigration in the context of official duties for the organization. The executive power score is appropriate as the order is based on existing legislation. The final scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration: 0, Executive Power: 1, Federalism: 0, Security/Liberty: 0, Economic Regulation: 0, Social Inclusion: 0.",
