    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1934 that waives civil service rules to appoint an individual to a position. It is difficult to assess the political bias of such a document without further context, but some assumptions can be made. Given the time period, the New Deal era, a moderate level of government intervention can be assumed. The order does not seem to obviously lean in any particular direction on most of the axes.",
