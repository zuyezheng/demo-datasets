    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1932 that temporarily excepts certain postal service positions from civil service examination requirements. This seems to be a measure to handle increased workload during the holiday season. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The temporary nature of the order suggests a balanced approach rather than a significant shift in any direction.",
