It also allows the Department of Justice to waive or modify apportionments of its appropriations. Here's an analysis of its political bias:Ideological Tilt: The document itself doesn't express a clear ideological stance. It's a practical measure related to national security during a specific historical context. Score: 0Immigration Approach: The document doesn't directly address immigration. Score: 0Executive Power: The order expands executive power by allowing the Attorney General to increase personnel and modify budget apportionments. While seemingly minor, it grants flexibility in response to a declared national emergency. Score: 2Federalism: The order doesn't significantly impact the balance of power between state and federal governments. It's primarily concerned with federal law enforcement. Score: 0National Security vs. Civil Liberties: The document leans slightly towards national security by increasing the FBI's capacity during a national emergency.
