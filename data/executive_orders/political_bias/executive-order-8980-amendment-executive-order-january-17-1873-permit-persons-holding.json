    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1941 amending a previous order to allow federal employees to serve on Alien Enemy Hearing Boards. This was during World War II. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, or social inclusion. It touches on executive power and federalism in a limited way, and national security is a key consideration given the context. Economic regulation is not relevant here. The primary purpose is to address a specific need during wartime, allowing for the functioning of Alien Enemy Hearing Boards. Therefore, the scores should reflect this specific and limited scope.",
