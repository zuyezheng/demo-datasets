    "critique": "The document pertains to a minor administrative change regarding the employment of professional experts and special agents within the Geological Survey. It specifies that these individuals will be employed for short periods at per diem salaries and paid only when actually employed. This change appears to be related to budgetary or administrative efficiency rather than any significant political or ideological agenda. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. There's a slight lean towards deregulation as it specifies per diem salaries, but it's minimal.",
