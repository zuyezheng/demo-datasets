    "critique": "This executive order establishes a bipartisan commission to review and make recommendations regarding the Social Security system. It aims to address the long-term financial stability of Social Security. There is an emphasis on bipartisanship and finding solutions. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It also does not seem to expand executive power, but rather delegates responsibilities to a commission. It also does not seem to affect federalism. It also does not seem to affect economic regulation. Therefore, the scores should be moderate.",
