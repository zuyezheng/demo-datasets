    "critique": "This document establishes a wildlife refuge in Alaska. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The federal government is exerting control over land in Alaska, which could be seen as a slight increase in federal power, but it's primarily for conservation purposes.",
