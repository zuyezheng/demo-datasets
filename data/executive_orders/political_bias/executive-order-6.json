    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the compensation and expenses for members of the advisory board of engineers for the Panama Canal project. It outlines specific amounts for their services, daily expenses, and travel costs. There is also a provision to ensure that retired officers on the board receive the same compensation as other members. The document does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only possible exception might be economic regulation, where one could argue that setting specific compensation levels constitutes a form of government intervention, but this is very indirect and minimal.",
