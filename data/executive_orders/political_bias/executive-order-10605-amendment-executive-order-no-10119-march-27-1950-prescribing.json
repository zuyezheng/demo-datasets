    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an executive order regarding basic allowances for subsistence to members of the uniformed services. It specifies how enlisted members who are being subsisted in kind in a mess and whose duties require them to be absent from their station during one or more meals shall be entitled for each such meal to a prorated share of the daily basic allowance for subsistence. The amendment authorizes the Secretaries of Defense, Treasury, and Commerce to establish the amount of the prorated share of the daily basic allowance for subsistence applicable to each one of the three daily meals, which amount shall be uniform for all the services concerned. The total of the amounts of the shares for the three daily meals shall not exceed the amount of the basic daily allowance for subsistence authorized by section 301 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949.",
