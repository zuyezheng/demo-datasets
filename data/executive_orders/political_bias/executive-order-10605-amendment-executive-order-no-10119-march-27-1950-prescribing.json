    "critique": "This executive order pertains to a very specific and relatively minor adjustment in the payment of basic allowances for subsistence to members of the uniformed services. It doesn't touch upon any of the major ideological or political debates. Therefore, most of the axes should be scored as neutral. The order itself doesn't expand executive power in any meaningful way; it simply delegates authority to the Secretaries of Defense, Treasury, and Commerce to determine the prorated share of the daily basic allowance. It also doesn't have any implications for immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
