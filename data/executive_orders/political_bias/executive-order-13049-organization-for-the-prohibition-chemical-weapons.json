    "critique": "This document designates the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the International Organizations Immunities Act. This seems fairly centrist and balanced. There's no clear indication of a liberal or conservative agenda. It doesn't obviously expand executive power, nor does it touch on federalism, immigration, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
