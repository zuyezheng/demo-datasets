    "critique": "This document pertains to the modification of the Cibola National Forest boundaries in New Mexico. It authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to dispose of land under the act of March 1, 1907. Given the limited scope concerning land management and disposal, the document has minimal implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, most axes are scored as neutral.",
