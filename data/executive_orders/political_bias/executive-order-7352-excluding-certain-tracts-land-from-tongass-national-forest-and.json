    "critique": "This document is a land order from 1936, transferring small parcels of land from the Tongass National Forest in Alaska back to private individuals for homesites. It's a fairly routine administrative action. There is very little to assess regarding political bias. The action itself could be seen as slightly favoring individual property rights over federal land control, but it's on such a small scale as to be negligible.",
