    "critique": "This executive order establishes the White House Coal Advisory Council. It seems to be focused on labor-management relations, mine safety, and productivity within the coal industry. There's no direct indication of a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It could be argued that promoting coal usage leans slightly conservative due to historical ties, but it's primarily an economic and energy-related decision. The order delegates administrative functions to the Secretary of Labor, which doesn't drastically shift federalism. The council's focus on the coal industry suggests a slight leaning towards deregulation or less intervention in that specific sector. There's no clear impact on social inclusion. The order itself doesn't expand executive power significantly, as it establishes an advisory council with limited scope and a defined termination date.",
