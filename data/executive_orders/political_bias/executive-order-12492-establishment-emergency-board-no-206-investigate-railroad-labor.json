    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between a rail road and a union. It is based on the Railway Labor Act. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It does not deal with immigration. It does not expand executive power beyond what is already established in law. It does not obviously favor the federal government over the state. It does not obviously impact national security or civil liberties. It involves the government in economic regulation by intervening in a labor dispute. It does not seem to have a strong impact on social inclusion.",
