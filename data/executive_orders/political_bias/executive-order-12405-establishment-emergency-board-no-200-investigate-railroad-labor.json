    "critique": "This executive order establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between a rail corporation and a union. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or social inclusion. It temporarily restricts both the company and the union from changing conditions, which could be seen as a moderate intervention in economic activity. It also expands executive power by creating the board. It has a neutral impact on federalism and national security vs. civil liberties.",
