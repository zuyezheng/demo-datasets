    "critique": "This executive order primarily concerns the delegation of authority regarding weapons proliferation, arms control, and related sanctions. It doesn't directly address typical ideological divides, immigration, or social inclusion. The order delegates authority to various secretaries, maintaining a balance between different departments. There's a slight emphasis on national security due to the focus on weapons control, but it's not extreme. The economic regulation aspect is moderate, as it involves sanctions and export controls. The order doesn't significantly expand executive power, as it mainly redistributes existing authority.",
