    "critique": "This executive order aims to streamline collective bargaining agreements within the federal government. It emphasizes efficiency, cost reduction, and management rights. It establishes an Interagency Labor Relations Working Group to assist agencies in negotiations and promotes the use of model ground rules to minimize delays. The order also seeks to ensure that agreements are consistent with applicable laws and regulations and do not cover non-negotiable matters. It requires agencies to report on operative CBAs and make them publicly accessible. The order does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It leans towards deregulation by seeking to reduce the cost of agency operations and expand agency flexibility. It also centralizes authority by establishing the Labor Relations Group and requiring agencies to report to OPM. It could be seen as expanding executive power by directing agencies to take specific actions in collective bargaining negotiations.",
