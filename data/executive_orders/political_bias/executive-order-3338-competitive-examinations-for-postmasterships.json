    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the process of filling postmaster positions in first, second, and third-class post offices. It outlines a procedure involving the Civil Service Commission to conduct open competitive examinations for these vacancies, with certain qualifications for applicants (age and residency). It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order seems to reinforce the role of the Civil Service Commission, which could be seen as a slight restraint on executive power in appointments, but it's a very minor effect.",
