    "critique": "This executive order establishes the boundaries of the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation and withdraws the land from public sale. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt without more context, but setting aside land for Native American use could be seen as slightly liberal in its time. The order doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, or economic regulation. It does shift control of the land from public sale to Indian purposes, which could be interpreted as supporting a degree of social inclusion. Federalism is implicated as the federal government is setting aside land for a reservation.",
