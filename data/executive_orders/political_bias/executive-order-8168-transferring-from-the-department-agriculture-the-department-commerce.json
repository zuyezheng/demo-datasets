    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1939 that transfers land from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Commerce for use as a magnetic and seismological observatory. It does not seem to have any significant implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral.",
