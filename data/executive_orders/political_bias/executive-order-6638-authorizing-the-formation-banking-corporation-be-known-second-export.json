    "critique": "This document is an executive order creating the Second Export-Import Bank of Washington, D.C. in 1933. It is a response to the Great Depression and aims to stimulate the economy through international trade. Ideologically, it leans liberal due to its interventionist approach to the economy. It expands executive power by creating a new entity. It centralizes power at the federal level. It focuses on economic recovery rather than security or liberty. It strongly regulates the economy. It does not directly address social inclusion. Immigration is not directly addressed, but the bank is intended to facilitate trade with other nations.The initial scores reflect these considerations.\n\nThe revised scores take into account that while the document creates a bank, it does so under existing legislation (National Industrial Recovery Act). Therefore, the expansion of executive power is moderate rather than strong. Also, while the document enables international trade, it does not explicitly address immigration policies, so the immigration score should be neutral.",
