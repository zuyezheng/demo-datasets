    "critique": "This document is an executive order that adjusts the boundary between two national forests. It does not touch on any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that is relevant is federalism, and it is a very minor adjustment related to federal land management. Therefore, all axes except federalism should be scored as 0. Federalism is a very slight shift towards federal control, so I will score it as 1 initially.",
