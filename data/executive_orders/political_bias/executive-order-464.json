    "critique": "This document is a call to raise troops during the Civil War. It expresses a desire to bring the war to a speedy conclusion. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or social inclusion. It does expand executive power by calling for troops, and it centralizes power by setting quotas for states. It likely leans towards national security given the context of the war. There's no economic regulation mentioned.",
