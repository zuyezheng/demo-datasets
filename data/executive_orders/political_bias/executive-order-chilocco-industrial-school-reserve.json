    "critique": "This executive order withdraws land from sale and settlement and sets it apart for the use of the Pima and Maricopa Indians. This suggests a slight leaning towards social inclusion and a recognition of indigenous rights. However, it also includes a provision that excludes land to which title has already passed out of the US government, or to which valid homestead and preemption rights have attached, indicating a balance with existing property rights. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power dynamics, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
