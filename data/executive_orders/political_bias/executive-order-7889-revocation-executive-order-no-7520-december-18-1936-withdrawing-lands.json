    "critique": "This document revokes a previous executive order that withdrew lands for use by the War Department as a target range for the Arizona National Guard. It's a simple revocation with no clear ideological or political implications. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
