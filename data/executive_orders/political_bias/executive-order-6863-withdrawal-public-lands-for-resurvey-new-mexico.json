    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order, which temporarily removes public lands from settlement, location, sale, or entry pending a resurvey. It cites specific acts of Congress as its authority. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration. The order's impact on executive power is neutral, as it operates within existing legal frameworks and can be revoked by the President or Congress. The order centralizes control over these lands temporarily, which leans towards federal control. It doesn't directly impact national security or civil liberties. The economic impact is minimal, as it's a temporary withdrawal for resurveying. It doesn't directly address social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to neutral.",
