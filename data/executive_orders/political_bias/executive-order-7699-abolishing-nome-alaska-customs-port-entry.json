    "critique": "This document is an executive order that abolishes Nome, Alaska, as a customs port of entry. It does not seem to have any significant ideological tilt, immigration implications, impact on executive power, or implications for national security vs. civil liberties or social inclusion. It has a very slight deregulation effect as it reduces the number of customs ports, and it has a slight shift towards federalism as customs ports are generally a federal concern.",
