    "critique": "The document is a presidential order amending a previous executive order regarding the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. It establishes a Citizens Advisory Committee on Physical Fitness and Sports, with members appointed by the President. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral. The slight tilt towards expanding executive power comes from the president's direct control over committee appointments.",
