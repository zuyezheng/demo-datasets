It changes the name of a subsection and modifies the appointment and meeting procedures of the advisory committee. There is minimal ideological content. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any significant way. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
