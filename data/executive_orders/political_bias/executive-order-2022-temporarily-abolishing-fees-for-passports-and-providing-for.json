    "critique": "This executive order from 1914 waives fees for emergency passports and visaing passports. It's difficult to assess its ideological tilt without more context, but it seems like a practical measure. Immigration: The waiver of visa fees could be seen as slightly more open to immigration, but it's a minor effect. Executive Power: The order doesn't significantly expand or restrict executive power. Federalism: It doesn't directly impact the balance between state and federal power. National Security vs. Civil Liberties: The order doesn't have a clear impact on this axis. Economic Regulation: Waiving fees is a form of deregulation, but it's a very limited one. Social Inclusion: The order doesn't directly address social inclusion.",
