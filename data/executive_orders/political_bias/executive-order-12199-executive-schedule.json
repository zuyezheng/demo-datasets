It reassigns a position related to labor-management and wage/price stability to the Executive Director of the White House Conference on Aging. The document itself doesn't express explicit opinions on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral.",
