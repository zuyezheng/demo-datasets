    "critique": "This executive order establishes airspace restrictions over specific areas related to atomic energy facilities. It prioritizes national security by limiting access to these areas. There's no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, or social inclusion. It could be argued that restricting airspace expands executive power, but it's more directly related to national security. The order centralizes control over airspace with the federal government. Economic regulation is not directly addressed, but the restrictions could have indirect economic effects. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
