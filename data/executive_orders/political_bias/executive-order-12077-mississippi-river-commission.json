    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts Roy T. Sessums from mandatory retirement. It does not seem to have any implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it seems to affect is executive power, as it is an example of the executive branch using its power to make an exception to a law. However, this is a very minor expansion of executive power, so I will score it as a 1.",
