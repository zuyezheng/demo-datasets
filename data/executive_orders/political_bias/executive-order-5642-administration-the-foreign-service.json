    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1931 that establishes regulations for the Foreign Service. It covers various aspects of the Foreign Service, including appointments, examinations, promotions, salaries, retirement, leaves of absence, and compensation. It also defines the roles and responsibilities of consular officers and other personnel. The document does not directly address issues related to ideological tilt, immigration, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes should be neutral. The document does expand executive power by establishing regulations and authorizing the Secretary of State to prescribe additional rules. It also centralizes control at the federal level by defining the structure and function of the Foreign Service. Therefore, the score for federalism should be positive.",
