    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1920 that directs the creation of an official flag for the Secretary of State to be displayed during official visits, particularly to South America. It mainly concerns protocol and representation. There's little to suggest a strong ideological leaning (Liberal/Conservative). It doesn't directly address immigration. The order delegates authority for creating the flag, but it doesn't drastically expand executive power. It doesn't significantly impact the balance between state and federal power (Federalism). It doesn't directly relate to national security vs. civil liberties. It has no bearing on economic regulation. It doesn't directly promote or hinder social inclusion; it's about official representation.",
