    "critique": "The document primarily concerns the transfer of administrative responsibilities related to customs, tax, and control of certain regulated items (alcohol, tobacco, firearms, explosives) to the Department of Treasury. There is no explicit discussion of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be neutral, with a slight lean towards security due to the inclusion of explosives regulation.",
