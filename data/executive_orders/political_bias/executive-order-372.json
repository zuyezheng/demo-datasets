    "critique": "This executive order establishes a board to organize the US government's participation in the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition. It aims to showcase the functions and resources of the government in peace and war. There's no clear ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It involves federal coordination but doesn't drastically shift power from states. It doesn't directly regulate the economy or address social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. However, there is a slight increase in executive power as the president is directing the executive departments to participate in the exhibition and is designating the chairman of the board.",
