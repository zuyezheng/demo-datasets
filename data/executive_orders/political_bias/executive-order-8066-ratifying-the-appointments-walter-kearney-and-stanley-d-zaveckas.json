    "critique": "The document discusses appointments to competitive classified positions in the United States Despatch Agency, Department of State, at New York, New York, without compliance with the competitive provisions of the Civil Sendee Rules. It retroactively confirms and ratifies these appointments, which were made under a previous administration due to a misapprehension about the positions' classification. The document does not express any clear political bias. It focuses on administrative procedure and rectifying a past error in appointments. Therefore, most scores are neutral.",
