    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of the Interior regarding an International Symposium on Geothermal Energy. It's a fairly technical and procedural document. There is little to no indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
