    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1931 that waives civil service rules to allow Mrs. Cecil Alexander to be appointed to a position in the Post Office Department. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of this document, as it is a specific personnel decision. It does not seem to have any implications for immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores will be neutral.",
