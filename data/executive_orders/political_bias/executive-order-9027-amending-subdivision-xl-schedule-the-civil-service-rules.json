    "critique": "This document is a simple amendment to the Civil Service Rules, adding a general counsel position. It's difficult to assess its impact on most of the axes without more context. It doesn't seem to have a strong ideological tilt, immigration implications, or direct effects on federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that seems relevant is executive power, and even there, the impact is minimal. The creation of a general counsel position could be seen as a slight expansion of the executive branch's capabilities, but it's a very minor change.",
