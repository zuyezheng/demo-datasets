    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an executive order, focusing on the composition of the President's Council on Youth Opportunity. It primarily deals with the structure and membership of a governmental body. There is little to no information related to ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
