    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding silver certificates and currency. It delegates authority related to issuing silver certificates and coining silver dollars. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power grab, federalism shift, national security concern, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The delegation of authority could be seen as a slight shift in executive power, but it's minimal.",
