    "critique": "This document is a military order to provide medical assistance to ex-President Andrew Jackson. It doesn't touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that might be relevant is executive power, but even there, it's a very minor instance of the President directing the military to provide a service. It's a courtesy more than an expansion of power.",
