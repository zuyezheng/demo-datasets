    "critique": "This document pertains to the extension of trust lands for the Pala Band of Mission Indians in California. It does not directly address typical left-right ideological concerns, immigration, executive power grabs, or national security. It touches on federalism by reaffirming the federal government's role in managing trust lands, and it implicitly supports social inclusion by protecting the land rights of a Native American tribe. There is no economic regulation mentioned. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this.",
