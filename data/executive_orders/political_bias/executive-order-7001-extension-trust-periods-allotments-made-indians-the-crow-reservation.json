    "critique": "This document pertains to the extension of trust periods for land allotments made to Native Americans of the Crow Reservation in Montana. It references the act of February 8, 1887, and the act of June 18, 1934. The order extends trust periods for 10 years, but this extension is contingent on a vote by the adult Indians of the reservation. If a majority votes in favor of applying the provisions of the 1934 act to the reservation, the order becomes ineffective. This suggests a degree of self-determination for the tribe. The document itself doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, or national security. It touches on federalism by involving federal oversight of tribal lands, but also allows for tribal input. It has implications for economic regulation by controlling land use and resources. It also has implications for social inclusion by dealing with Native American affairs.",
