    "critique": "The document extends trust periods on land allotments made to Native Americans of the Crow Reservation. It suggests a paternalistic approach, with the government acting as a trustee. However, it also includes a provision for self-determination, allowing the tribe to decide whether to apply the Indian Reorganization Act, which could end the trust period. This indicates a balance between federal control and tribal autonomy.",
