    "critique": "The document is an executive order that exempts seasonal recreational services on Federal lands from the minimum wage requirements established by Executive Order 13658. This is presented as a measure to prevent increased costs for guided tours and hikes, thereby ensuring access to Federal lands for visitors of all means. The order argues that applying the minimum wage increase to these services would negatively affect hours worked by recreational service workers due to their irregular schedules and high turnover. However, the exemption does not apply to lodging and food services associated with these recreational services.",
