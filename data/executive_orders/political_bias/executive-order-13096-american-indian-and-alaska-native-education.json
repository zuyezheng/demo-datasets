    "critique": "This executive order focuses on improving educational outcomes for American Indian and Alaska Native students. It establishes an interagency task force to coordinate federal efforts, promote intergovernmental collaboration, and assist tribal governments in meeting the unique educational needs of their children. The order emphasizes preserving native languages and cultural traditions. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion beyond the specific context of Native American education. Therefore, the scores reflect this targeted focus.",
