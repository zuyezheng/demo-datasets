    "critique": "This is an executive order that extends the exemption of Walter C. Mendenhall, Director of the Geological Survey, from compulsory retirement for one year. It is a fairly specific action pertaining to one individual. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It has a very slight impact on executive power, federalism, economic regulation and social inclusion. Therefore, all of these should be close to zero.",
