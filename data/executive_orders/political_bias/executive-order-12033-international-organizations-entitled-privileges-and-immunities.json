This action is based on the International Organizations Immunities Act. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power shift, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation changes, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
