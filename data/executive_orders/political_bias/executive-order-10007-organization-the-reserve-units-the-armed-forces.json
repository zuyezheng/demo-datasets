    "critique": "The document emphasizes national security and the importance of a strong military reserve. It encourages citizen participation in building up the armed forces. There is no discussion of economic regulation, social inclusion, or immigration. The document expands executive power by directing the Secretary of Defense and other department heads to organize and train reserve component units. It also centralizes authority in the federal government by tasking the Secretary of Defense with these responsibilities.",
