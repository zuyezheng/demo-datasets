    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to study and simplify the presidential appointment process. It aims to reduce the complexity of forms and improve coordination between the executive branch and Senate committees. There is no immediately obvious ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards deregulation, as it aims to simplify forms, but this is a very weak signal.",
