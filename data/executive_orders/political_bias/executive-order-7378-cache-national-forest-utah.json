    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 that expands the Cache National Forest in Utah. It is primarily a land management action. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration. It could be argued that setting aside land for national forest slightly expands executive power, but it's a fairly standard action. It centralizes control of these lands under the federal government. It doesn't directly impact national security or civil liberties. It has a slight impact on economic regulation by potentially limiting resource extraction. It doesn't directly address social inclusion.",
