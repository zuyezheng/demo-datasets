    "critique": "The document is a land order related to New Mexico. It revokes a previous order and temporarily withdraws certain lands for use and development by the Department of Agriculture for soil erosion control and other land utilization activities. There is a provision that allows for mineral resource prospecting and development. This seems like a fairly neutral document with some potential leaning towards federal control.",
