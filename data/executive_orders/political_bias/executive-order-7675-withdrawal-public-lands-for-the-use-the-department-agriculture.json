    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1937 that withdraws certain lands in New Mexico from settlement, location, sale, or entry, and reserves them for use and development by the Department of Agriculture for soil erosion control and other land utilization activities. It also allows for prospecting, locating, developing, mining, entering, leasing, or patenting the mineral resources of the lands under the applicable laws. The order centralizes control over these lands under the federal government, specifically the Department of Agriculture. There is no mention of immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The order seems to favor federal control over state control. It also seems to favor government intervention in land use and development. There is no clear ideological tilt.",
