    "critique": "This document establishes military tribunals in occupied Germany after WWII to try war criminals. It is signed by the President. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties within the US, or economic regulation. It centralizes power in the executive branch to set up these tribunals, and it does not directly address social inclusion within the US. The ideological tilt is difficult to assess directly, but the pursuit of justice for war crimes could be seen as aligned with international law and human rights, which are often associated with liberal values. However, the context of military tribunals also suggests a focus on security and order. The federalism axis is not directly relevant as it concerns actions in occupied territory.",
