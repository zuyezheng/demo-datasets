It involves representatives from various federal departments to coordinate and improve citizenship training. The document emphasizes cooperation between federal offices and with public/private agencies. There is no explicit mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial and revised scores are the same.",
