Harry Lewis, to be appointed as an examiner of merchandise due to his unique skills in translating Chinese and Japanese invoices. This exception is justified by his long service and the invaluable benefit he would bring to the Customs Service. The request is supported by the appraiser at New York and the Secretary of the Treasury.",
