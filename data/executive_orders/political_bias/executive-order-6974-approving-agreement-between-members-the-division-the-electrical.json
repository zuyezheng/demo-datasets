    "critique": "This document is an approval by President Roosevelt of an agreement between employers and employees in the construction industry, under the authority of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933. The Act itself was a key component of the New Deal, aimed at regulating industry and promoting economic recovery during the Great Depression. The document reflects a strong interventionist approach to the economy, with the federal government playing a central role in setting standards and resolving disputes. There is no information related to immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The document expands executive power, as it is an executive order approving an agreement under the authority of a federal act. The federal government is taking primacy over the states. The ideological tilt is liberal, as it favors government intervention in the economy.",
