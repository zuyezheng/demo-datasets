    "critique": "This document pertains to the administration of the National Prohibition Act in the Virgin Islands. It shifts administrative responsibility from the Treasury Secretary to the Navy Secretary. This seems like a relatively neutral action with limited ideological implications. The transfer of power doesn't inherently expand executive power, nor does it directly impact federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document does not address immigration. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
