    "critique": "This executive order concerns the redrawing of the Sioux Indian Reservation boundaries in Dakota Territory and the restoration of the described land to the public domain. This action reflects a policy of reducing the land allocated to Native American tribes, which aligns with a historical trend of prioritizing westward expansion and resource extraction over indigenous rights. This suggests a conservative approach regarding land use and a lack of emphasis on social inclusion for Native American populations. The order centralizes control over land management at the federal level, diminishing tribal sovereignty. There is no direct impact on economic regulation, national security vs. civil liberties, immigration, or executive power. Therefore, the scores are as follows:",
