    "critique": "This document amends several departmental rules to include widows of veterans in reinstatement eligibility, regardless of the time since separation from service. This suggests a slight tilt towards social inclusion by expanding benefits to a specific group (widows of veterans). It doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation. Therefore, most axes should be neutral, with a slight positive score for social inclusion.",
