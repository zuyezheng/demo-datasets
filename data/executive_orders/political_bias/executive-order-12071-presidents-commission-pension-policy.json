    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to study and make recommendations on retirement, survivor, and disability programs. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. It does involve government in economic matters by studying and potentially reforming these programs, but it's primarily an investigatory and advisory role. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards government intervention in the economy.",
