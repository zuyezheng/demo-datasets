    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Presidential Service Certificate and Badge for members of the Armed Forces assigned to the White House Office and other direct support positions within the Executive Office of the President. It seems largely ceremonial and administrative in nature. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on economic regulation. It does not obviously expand executive power, shift the balance of federalism, or impinge on civil liberties. It also doesn't seem to promote or hinder social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
