    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the order of succession within the Department of Agriculture. It specifies who can act as Secretary of Agriculture if both the Secretary and Deputy Secretary are unavailable. It also revokes a previous executive order on the same topic. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It seems to have a neutral impact on federalism, economic regulation, and social inclusion. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by clarifying the line of succession, but it's a very minor expansion. Therefore, the initial scores are mostly neutral with a slight lean towards expanding executive power.",
