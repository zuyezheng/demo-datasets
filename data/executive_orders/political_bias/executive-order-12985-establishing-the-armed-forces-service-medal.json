    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Armed Forces Service Medal. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's a slight tilt towards national security due to its focus on military operations, but it's not significant enough to warrant a high score.",
