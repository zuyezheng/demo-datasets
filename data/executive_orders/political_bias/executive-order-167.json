    "critique": "This document is an approval of a railroad franchise in Hawaii, dating back to 1900. It's a legal ratification of an existing agreement. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It touches on federalism insofar as it's a federal approval of a local matter. The economic regulation aspect is present but not strong, as it simply approves a railroad. Social inclusion is not really addressed. Executive power is slightly expanded as it is an approval by the president.",
