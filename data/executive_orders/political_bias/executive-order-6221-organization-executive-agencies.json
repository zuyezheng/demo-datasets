    "critique": "The document is a government order that defers the effective date of certain sections of a previous executive order. It relates to cooperative vocational education and rehabilitation, payments for agricultural experiment stations, cooperative agricultural extension work, endowment and maintenance of colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts, and the abolishment of the Federal Employment Stabilization Board and the transfer of its records to the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works. It does not express strong opinions on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial and revised scores are set to neutral.",
