    "critique": "This executive order moves attorneys in the Veterans' Administration into the competitive classified service. This likely increases the power of the federal government, and could be seen as slightly liberal in that it increases the power of the federal government and provides more job security. It has little to no impact on immigration, executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
