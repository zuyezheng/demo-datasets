    "critique": "This executive order is a simple directive granting federal employees a half-day off before Christmas. It also encourages a liberal leave policy during the holiday season, while ensuring essential services remain staffed for national security or public reasons. There's no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, expansion of executive power, or shifts in federalism. It doesn't touch upon national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
