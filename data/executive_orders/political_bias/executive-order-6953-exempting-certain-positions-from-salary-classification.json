    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1935 that exempts certain positions from a previous executive order. These positions are consultants, experts, specialists, attorneys, and other similar positions that are intermittently employed on a per diem basis or employed on an annual basis at amounts representing the value of part-time service required, and who are or have been paid from the public works fund or other emergency funds administered by the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of Public Works, available during the fiscal year 1935. The order does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It seems to be a technical adjustment related to employment within the public works programs of the time.",
