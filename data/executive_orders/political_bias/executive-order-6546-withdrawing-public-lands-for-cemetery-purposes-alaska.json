    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that withdraws and reserves public land in the Territory of Alaska for burial purposes. It is a very specific and localized action. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism concerns, national security vs. civil liberties issues, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
