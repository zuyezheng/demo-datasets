    "critique": "This document pertains to the National Industrial Recovery Act, which was a New Deal program. This program was designed to combat the Great Depression through government intervention in the economy. Therefore, it would be considered liberal in the sense that it favors government intervention. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. However, it does involve economic regulation.",
