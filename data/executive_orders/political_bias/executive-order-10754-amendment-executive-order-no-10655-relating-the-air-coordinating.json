    "critique": "This document is a very minor amendment to a previous executive order, dealing with the composition of a committee. It doesn't touch on any major ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It slightly adjusts executive power by adding a presidential appointee to the committee, and doesn't directly impact federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight nudge towards expanding executive power.",
