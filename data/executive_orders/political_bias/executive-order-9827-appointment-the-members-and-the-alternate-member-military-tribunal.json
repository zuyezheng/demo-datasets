    "critique": "This document establishes a military tribunal in post-WWII Germany to try war criminals. It's difficult to place this on a traditional left-right spectrum. It doesn't directly address immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does delegate authority to the Secretary of War and other officials, but this seems necessary for the function of the tribunal. The document does not obviously expand executive power beyond what is necessary to fulfill its purpose. The focus is on national security and justice for war crimes, which could be seen as potentially impinging on individual rights, but in the context of war crimes trials, this is a necessary consideration. The document does not directly address federalism.",
