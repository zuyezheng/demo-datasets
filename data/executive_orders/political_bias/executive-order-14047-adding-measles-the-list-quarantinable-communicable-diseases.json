    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous order to add \"Measles\" to the list of quarantinable communicable diseases. It does not obviously relate to any of the axes except perhaps national security vs. civil liberties, and executive power. Because the order is simply adding a disease to a list, it doesn't seem to expand executive power in any meaningful way. It also doesn't seem to impinge on civil liberties in any obvious way, as quarantines are already an accepted practice. It is difficult to assign a strong score on any of the axes. The order seems neutral regarding ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, economic regulation, and social inclusion.",
