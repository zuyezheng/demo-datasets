    "critique": "The document establishes a council to advise the President and government agencies on consumer affairs, representing a moderate level of government intervention in the economy. It also expands executive power by creating a council under the Secretary of Commerce's control. The document doesn't directly address immigration, federalism, security/liberty, or social inclusion, so those scores are neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the interventionist approach.",
