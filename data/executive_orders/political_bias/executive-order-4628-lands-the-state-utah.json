    "critique": "This document pertains to the definition of a boundary for an Indian reservation. It does not directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The federal government is defining the boundary of the reservation, so there is a slight increase in federal power.",
