    "critique": "This document is an amendment to a departmental rule, specifically creating an exception for an artist position within the Department of Agriculture. It's a very narrow and specific personnel matter. There's no indication of broad ideological or political implications. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document doesn't touch upon immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It's simply an administrative exception for a specific role.",
