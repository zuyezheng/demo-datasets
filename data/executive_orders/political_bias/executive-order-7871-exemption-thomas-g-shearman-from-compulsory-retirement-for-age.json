    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1938 that exempts a specific individual from mandatory retirement. It's a fairly narrow action. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on a left-right spectrum. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in general, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that is relevant is executive power, and it slightly expands it, but only in a very limited, specific case. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
