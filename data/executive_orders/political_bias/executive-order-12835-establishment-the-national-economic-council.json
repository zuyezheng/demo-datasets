    "critique": "This document establishes the National Economic Council. It aims to coordinate economic policy-making, provide economic advice to the President, ensure consistency with the President's goals, and monitor the implementation of the President's economic policy agenda. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. However, the establishment of such a council could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, as it centralizes economic policy coordination within the executive branch. It also leans slightly towards government intervention in the economy, as the council's purpose is to coordinate and monitor economic policy. The document itself is neutral on other axes.",
