It focuses on inter-agency coordination and responsibilities, particularly between the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, and Army. There's an emphasis on comprehensive development and efficient use of water resources. The document doesn't directly address social issues, immigration, or civil liberties. Therefore, the scores reflect its focus on governmental processes and resource management.",
