    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating the authority to pay compensation to former hostages in Iran to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The act of compensating hostages could be seen as slightly leaning towards social inclusion, but it's primarily a humanitarian act.",
