    "critique": "This executive order focuses on floodplain management and aims to reduce flood risks and preserve natural floodplain values. It mandates federal agencies to consider flood hazards in their actions and planning, promoting responsible land use and construction practices in floodplains. There's a slight tilt towards environmental protection and government intervention in land management, but it doesn't strongly align with any particular political ideology. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
