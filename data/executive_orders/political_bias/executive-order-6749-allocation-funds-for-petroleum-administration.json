    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1934 allocating funds to the Secretary of the Interior for regulating commerce in petroleum under the National Industrial Recovery Act. This involves government intervention in the economy. There is no information about immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the interventionist nature of the policy during the New Deal era.",
