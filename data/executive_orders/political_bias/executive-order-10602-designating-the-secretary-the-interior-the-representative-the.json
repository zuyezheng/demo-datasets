    "critique": "The document is a designation of the Secretary of the Interior as the representative of the President to approve the obligation and expenditure by the government of the Virgin Islands of moneys referred to in section 7652 (b) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. This is a delegation of authority and doesn't directly address the axes of political bias. However, it does imply a level of federal oversight and control over the Virgin Islands' finances.",
