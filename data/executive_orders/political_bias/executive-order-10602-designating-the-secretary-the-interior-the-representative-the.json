    "critique": "This document is a delegation of authority from the President to the Secretary of the Interior regarding the expenditure of funds by the government of the Virgin Islands. It is a technical document with no clear ideological tilt. It does not address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It relates to federalism by designating a federal representative to oversee the expenditure of funds by a territory, which could be seen as a slight increase in federal control.",
