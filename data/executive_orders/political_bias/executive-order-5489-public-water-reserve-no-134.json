It doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The act of withdrawing land could be seen as a slight expansion of federal power, but it's primarily an administrative action.",
