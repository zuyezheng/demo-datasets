    "critique": "This document is a withdrawal of public lands in Oregon from settlement, location, sale, entry and all forms of appropriation, pending a resurvey of said township. It cites the act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 847), as amended by the act of August 24, 1912 (37 Stat. 497), and subject to the conditions, provisions and limitations of said acts, and the act of March 3, 1909 (35 Stat. 845). It also states that the order shall continue in full force and effect unless and until revoked by the President, or by an act of Congress. This document does not seem to have any ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties implications, economic regulation implications, or social inclusion implications. Therefore, all scores should be 0.",
