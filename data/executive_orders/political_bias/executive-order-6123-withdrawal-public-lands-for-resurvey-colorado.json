    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order from 1933, signed by the President. It withdraws public lands in Colorado from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. This seems to be a fairly routine administrative action. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly relate to immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any obvious way. Federalism is implicated insofar as the federal government is managing federal lands, but this is within its normal purview. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
