    "critique": "The document expands executive power by authorizing the Administrator to appoint personnel, fix compensation, conduct hearings, and exercise functions vested in the President by Title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act, subject to the approval of the Special Industrial Recovery Board. It also centralizes federal control by granting the Administrator these powers, indicating a move towards federal primacy. In terms of economic regulation, the document leans towards government intervention as it empowers the Administrator to oversee industrial recovery efforts. The document does not directly address social inclusion, immigration, security vs. liberty, or ideological tilt, so those scores are neutral.",
