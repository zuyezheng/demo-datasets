It focuses on the logistics and legal basis for this transfer, citing the Surplus Property Act of 1944 and the First War Powers Act of 1941. There is minimal focus on ideological issues, immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The order emphasizes executive authority in reorganizing government functions.",
