    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order to allow federal employees to teach in state, territorial, or municipal schools/universities, provided it doesn't interfere with their federal duties. This seems to promote a cooperative relationship between the federal government and local education systems. It doesn't strongly lean liberal or conservative, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism in a major way, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. The primary effect seems to be to allow federal employees to contribute to local education, which could be seen as a slight move towards federal involvement in education, but not a strong one. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards federalism.",
