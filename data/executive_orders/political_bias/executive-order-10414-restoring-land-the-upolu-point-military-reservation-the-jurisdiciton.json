    "critique": "This document is an executive order transferring land from federal to territorial control. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt. It returns land, so it doesn't expand executive power. It favors state control since it gives land to the Territory of Hawaii. It doesn't directly address national security or civil liberties. It doesn't seem to have a direct impact on economic regulation. It doesn't directly address social inclusion.",
