    "critique": "This executive order revokes a previous order regarding hospital services for the Alaska Railroad. It's a fairly specific and limited action. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. However, the revocation could be interpreted as a slight move towards deregulation or less government intervention in providing specific services, but it's very marginal. Given the limited scope, most axes should be close to neutral.",
