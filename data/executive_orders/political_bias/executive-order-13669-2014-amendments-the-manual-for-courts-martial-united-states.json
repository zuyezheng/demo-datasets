    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending the Manual for Courts-Martial. It primarily concerns military justice and legal procedures within the armed forces. It does not directly address immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order itself doesn't inherently expand executive power, but rather modifies existing procedures within the military justice system. It also doesn't directly impact federalism or the balance between national security and civil liberties in a broad sense. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
