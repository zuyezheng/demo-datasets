    "critique": "This executive order withdraws land for a boarding and industrial school for Native American tribes. This suggests a paternalistic approach, but also an attempt at social inclusion through education, albeit one that may not respect tribal traditions. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power grab, or economic regulation. Federalism is implicated as the federal government is making decisions about land in a territory. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly addressed, but the act of setting aside land for a specific group could be seen as promoting social inclusion.",
