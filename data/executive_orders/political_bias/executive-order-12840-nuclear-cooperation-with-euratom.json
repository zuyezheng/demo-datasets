    "critique": "This document is an executive order extending peaceful nuclear cooperation with the European Atomic Energy Community. It does not obviously lean liberal or conservative. It does not relate to immigration. It arguably expands executive power insofar as it is an executive order, but it is also based on existing law. It does not obviously relate to federalism. It arguably relates to national security, but also to international cooperation. It does not obviously relate to economic regulation. It does not obviously relate to social inclusion.",
