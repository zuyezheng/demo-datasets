    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the line of succession within the Department of Labor. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that is relevant is executive power. The order simply clarifies who can perform the duties of the Secretary of Labor in specific circumstances. This could be seen as a very slight expansion of executive power, but it is primarily an administrative matter.",
