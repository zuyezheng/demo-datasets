    "critique": "This executive order pertains to military compensation and qualifications. It establishes a system for additional pay based on proficiency in arms for enlisted Navy personnel. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order itself doesn't expand executive power, but it does delegate authority to the Secretary of the Navy to prescribe standards and periods of time for additional compensation.",
