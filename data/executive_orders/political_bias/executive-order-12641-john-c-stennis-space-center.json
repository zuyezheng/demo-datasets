    "critique": "This document is a simple renaming of a NASA facility in honor of Senator John C. Stennis. It expresses admiration for his support of the space program. There is little to analyze in terms of political bias across the defined axes. Most scores should be neutral. The act of renaming a facility doesn't inherently expand executive power, so that should be neutral as well.",
