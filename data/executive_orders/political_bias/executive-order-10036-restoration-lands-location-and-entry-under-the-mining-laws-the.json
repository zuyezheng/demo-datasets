    "critique": "This document pertains to opening land in Angeles National Forest, California, for mining under US mining laws. It does not directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The action of opening land for mining could be seen as slightly deregulatory, but it's a stretch.",
