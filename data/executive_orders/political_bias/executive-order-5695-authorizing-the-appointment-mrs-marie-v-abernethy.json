    "critique": "This document is an executive order to allow Mrs. Marie V. Abernethy to be appointed as a clerk in the Treasury Department, regardless of how long she has been separated from the service. The order is recommended by the Acting Secretary of the Treasury, who states that Mrs. Abernethy served in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing from June 1, 1912, to June 30, 1912, when she tendered her resignation, and that she also served temporarily in the Treasury Department during the years 1929 and 1930. Mrs. Abernethy has a disabled husband and four small children to support. This seems like a fairly neutral document with little political bias. It is focused on a specific individual and her employment situation. There is a slight tilt towards social inclusion, as it considers her family situation. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation.",
