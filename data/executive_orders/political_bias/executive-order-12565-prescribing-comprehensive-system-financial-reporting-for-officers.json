    "critique": "This executive order focuses on government ethics and financial reporting. It establishes a system for non-public financial reporting for executive branch employees to maintain public confidence and ethical standards. It amends a previous executive order (EO 11222) and tasks the Office of Government Ethics with administering the new system. There's no clear indication of a liberal or conservative tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power expansion, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order seems to reinforce existing ethical guidelines and reporting mechanisms, so it doesn't drastically alter the balance of power or policy in any particular direction.",
