    "critique": "This document pertains to the organization and conscription of troops during a time of war. It outlines procedures for volunteers and the draft. Given the historical context (likely the US Civil War), several axes are relevant. Ideological Tilt is difficult to assess without knowing the specific political goals of the war effort at the time, but given that it is a war department order, we can assume a moderate stance. Immigration is not relevant. Executive Power is somewhat expanded as it is an order from the President. Federalism is hard to judge, but the draft implies federal control. National Security is prioritized over civil liberties due to the draft. Economic Regulation is not directly addressed. Social Inclusion is not directly addressed, but the draft could be seen as a move towards conformity.",
