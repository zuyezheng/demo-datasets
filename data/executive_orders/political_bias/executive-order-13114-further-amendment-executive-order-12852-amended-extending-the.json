    "critique": "This document is a simple extension of an existing executive order related to the President's Council on Sustainable Development. It does not contain strong indicators for any of the axes. The extension itself doesn't inherently lean liberal or conservative. It doesn't deal with immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
