It seems to be a technical correction related to land management. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism concerns, national security vs. civil liberties considerations, economic regulation aspects, or social inclusion dimensions. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
