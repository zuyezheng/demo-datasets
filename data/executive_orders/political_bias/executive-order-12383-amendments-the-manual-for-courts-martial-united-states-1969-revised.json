    "critique": "This document amends the Manual for Courts-Martial regarding drug offenses. It increases penalties for certain drug-related offenses, especially when committed in specific circumstances (e.g., on duty, in a hostile fire zone). This reflects a law-and-order approach with a focus on maintaining discipline within the military. There is a slight tilt towards security over liberty, and a conservative approach to drug policy.",
