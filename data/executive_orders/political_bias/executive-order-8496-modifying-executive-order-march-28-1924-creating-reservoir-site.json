    "critique": "The document is a modification to an executive order regarding the Deschutes River in Oregon. It allows the Federal Power Commission to issue permits and licenses for power projects on unsurveyed tracts near Odell Lake, with the condition that these projects can be discontinued if they conflict with US-authorized project works. The document itself doesn't express strong opinions on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral.",
