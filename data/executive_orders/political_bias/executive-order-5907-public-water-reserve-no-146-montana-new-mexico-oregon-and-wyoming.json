    "critique": "This document is an executive order withdrawing land from settlement, location, sale, or entry and reserving it for public use. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The act of withdrawing land could be seen as a slight increase in federal control, but it's primarily related to land management rather than a significant shift in federalism.",
