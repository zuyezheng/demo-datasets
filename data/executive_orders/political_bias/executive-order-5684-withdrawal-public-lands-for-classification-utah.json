    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1931 that temporarily withdraws public lands in Utah for classification. It cites the authority of the acts of Congress approved June 25, 1910, and August 24, 1912. The order specifies the land being withdrawn by referencing sections, townships, and ranges. The order remains in effect until revoked by the President or Congress. There is nothing about ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion.",
