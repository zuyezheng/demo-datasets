    "critique": "This executive order implements an arms embargo against Rwanda in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 918. It's difficult to place this on a traditional left-right spectrum. It doesn't directly address domestic policy issues. The order expands executive power insofar as it delegates authority to the Secretaries of State and Commerce to enforce the embargo. It centralizes control at the federal level. It prioritizes national security and international obligations. It involves government in regulating international trade of arms. It doesn't directly address social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration Approach: 0, Executive Power: 2, Federalism: 3, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 3, Economic Regulation: 2, Social Inclusion: 0. Upon further reflection, the expansion of executive power is relatively limited, as it is tied to a specific UN resolution and existing legislation. The federalism score is also moderate, as it primarily concerns international trade, which is traditionally a federal responsibility. The national security score is also moderate, as the embargo is aimed at preventing further conflict in Rwanda, rather than directly addressing threats to the US. The economic regulation score is also moderate, as it only affects the arms trade.",
