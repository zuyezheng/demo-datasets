    "critique": "This document is a withdrawal of public lands in New Mexico from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. This seems like a fairly neutral action with respect to the axes. There's no clear ideological tilt, immigration impact, expansion of executive power, or shift in federalism. It doesn't directly address national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores should be close to zero across the board.",
