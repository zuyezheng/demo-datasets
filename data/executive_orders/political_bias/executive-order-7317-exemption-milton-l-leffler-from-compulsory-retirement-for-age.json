    "critique": "This is an executive order that makes an exception to a rule about retirement age for a specific government employee. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion based on this document. The only axis that can be evaluated is executive power. The document expands executive power by allowing the President to exempt individuals from mandatory retirement.",
