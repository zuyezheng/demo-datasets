    "critique": "This executive order establishes the National Steel Labor Relations Board to address labor disputes in the iron and steel industry. It aims to protect employees' rights to organize and bargain collectively, investigate complaints of interference or discrimination, and mediate disputes between employers and employees. The order grants the board authority to conduct elections to determine employee representation and access relevant payroll documents. It also allows the board to create rules and regulations with presidential approval and requires the board to report its activities to the President through the Secretary of Labor. The board's existence is temporary, ceasing when its duties are completed. The order is rooted in the National Industrial Recovery Act, which was part of President Roosevelt's New Deal program. This program was designed to combat the Great Depression through government intervention in the economy. The creation of this board reflects a liberal approach to economic regulation and social inclusion, as it seeks to empower workers and promote collective bargaining. However, it does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, or national security vs. civil liberties. Therefore, the scores for these axes should be neutral.",
