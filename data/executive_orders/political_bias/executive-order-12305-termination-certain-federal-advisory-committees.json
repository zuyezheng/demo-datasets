    "critique": "This executive order revokes previous executive orders that established advisory committees for nominating judges. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt without knowing the specific composition and recommendations of the committees. However, the act of removing these committees could be seen as a move to consolidate power within the executive branch regarding judicial nominations. There is no direct impact on immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of these axes will be scored as neutral. The executive power axis might lean slightly towards expansion, but not significantly.",
