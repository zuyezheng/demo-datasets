It also authorizes the United States International Trade Commission to collect information for a database used in preparing reports to Congress. The order doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion but focuses on administrative procedure and information gathering.",
