    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to recommend nominees for circuit judge positions. It emphasizes equal justice under law and encourages panels to seek out well-qualified women and members of minority groups. It does not directly address immigration, national security, or economic regulation. It seems to balance federal and state interests by creating panels for different circuits. The order does not appear to expand executive power significantly, as it establishes a commission to aid in the selection process rather than directly appointing judges. It promotes diversity and inclusion in the selection process.",
