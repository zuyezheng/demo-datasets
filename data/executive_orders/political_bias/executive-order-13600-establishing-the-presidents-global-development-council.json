    "critique": "The document establishes the President's Global Development Council to advise the President on global development policy and programs. It aims to promote development as a core pillar of American power and coordinate development, diplomacy, and defense efforts. The council includes members from various sectors, including government officials and individuals from outside the Federal Government. The document emphasizes evidence-based decision-making, collaboration between the public and private sectors, and awareness of global development issues. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or economic regulation. The council is established within USAID and subject to the foreign policy and budgetary guidance of the Secretary of State. The document does not seem to strongly favor any particular ideology, but it does promote international cooperation and development, which could be seen as leaning slightly liberal. It does not significantly expand executive power or shift power between the federal government and the states. It has a neutral stance on national security vs. civil liberties and social inclusion. It promotes moderate government intervention through development programs.",
