    "critique": "This document is an executive order from Franklin D. Roosevelt modifying the Code of Fair Competition for the Baking Industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It adjusts the effective date, eliminates a stay on certain provisions, and extends the reporting period for an investigation. Given the context of the New Deal era, the document reflects government intervention in the economy. There is no information related to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is moderately liberal due to the interventionist approach. The economic regulation score is high due to the government's involvement in regulating the baking industry.",
