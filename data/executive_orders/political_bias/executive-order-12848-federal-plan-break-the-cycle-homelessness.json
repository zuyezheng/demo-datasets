    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on addressing homelessness. It directs federal agencies to develop a coordinated plan to break the cycle of homelessness and prevent future homelessness. It emphasizes streamlining existing programs, linking housing, support, and education services, and promoting coordination among various stakeholders. The order also calls for consultation with state and local governments, non-profit providers, advocates, and homeless individuals and families. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion beyond the scope of homelessness. Therefore, the scores should reflect this narrow focus.",
