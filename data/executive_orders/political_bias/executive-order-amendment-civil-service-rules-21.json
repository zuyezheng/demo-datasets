It allows for vacancies to be filled without examination for up to 30 days, pending a regular appointment. The change aims to provide flexibility in staffing while ensuring eventual compliance with standard appointment procedures. There is no indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, executive power shift, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
