    "critique": "This executive order aims to protect and empower the career federal workforce, encourage union organizing and collective bargaining, and promote a $15/hour minimum wage for Federal employees. It revokes several executive orders from 2018 and 2020 that were seen as undermining the civil service and limiting collective bargaining rights. The order also instructs agencies to negotiate over subjects related to collective bargaining. Overall, the document reflects a liberal stance on labor issues and the role of government in supporting workers' rights.",
