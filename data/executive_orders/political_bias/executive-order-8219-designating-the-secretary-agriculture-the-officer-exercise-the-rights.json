    "critique": "This document is a simple executive order that transfers authority over the Commodity Credit Corporation from the Secretary of the Treasury to the Secretary of Agriculture. It does not touch on any of the axes related to immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It also doesn't directly address ideological tilt. It has a very slight impact on economic regulation, as it consolidates power over the Commodity Credit Corporation in the hands of the Secretary of Agriculture, but this is a minor effect. It does not expand executive power, but rather shifts existing power. It does not directly affect federalism. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
