    "critique": "This document approves a code of fair competition for the Automotive Parts and Equipment Manufacturing Industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. \n\nIdeological Tilt: The NIRA was a New Deal program, which is generally considered liberal due to its interventionist approach to the economy. Therefore, a positive score is appropriate.\nImmigration Approach: The document does not address immigration, so it should be neutral.\nExecutive Power: Approving the code expands executive power as it implements a law giving the executive branch significant control over industry. Therefore, a positive score is appropriate.\nFederalism: The NIRA increased the power of the federal government over the states, so a positive score is appropriate.\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The document does not directly address national security or civil liberties, so it should be neutral.\nEconomic Regulation: The code of fair competition is a form of economic regulation, so a positive score is appropriate.\nSocial Inclusion: The document does not address social inclusion, so it should be neutral.",
