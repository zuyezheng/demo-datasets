It clarifies the applicability of the Act to contracts with the Corporation and related subcontracts, specifying the timeframes for which the provisions apply. There is nothing about ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, all scores should be 0.",
