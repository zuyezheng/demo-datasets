    "critique": "This document pertains to the transfer of land between two national forests, Lolo National Forest and Cabinet National Forest, under the authority of an act of Congress from 1897. It redefines boundaries and clarifies that it doesn't change the national-forest status of any publicly owned lands. Given the subject matter, the document has minimal ideological implications. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0).",
