    "critique": "This document is an executive order that amends a previous executive order to increase the number of participants in the Presidential Management Intern Program. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The increase in the number of interns could be seen as a slight expansion of the federal government's role, but it's minimal.",
