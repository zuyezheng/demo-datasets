    "critique": "The document reflects a historical context where the rights and needs of Native American tribes were often disregarded by the U.S. government. The act of restoring land previously designated for the Crow Indians back to the public domain, due to their non-removal to that land and congressional inaction, indicates a prioritization of westward expansion and resource access over honoring agreements with Native American tribes. This decision reflects a bias towards expanding federal control and facilitating settlement, with little regard for the social inclusion or rights of the Crow Indians.",
