    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1941 concerning compensation for employees of the War Department, Navy Department, Coast Guard, and The Panama Canal who are required to forego their vacations due to national defense needs. It does not directly address immigration, so the immigration score should be neutral. It delegates authority to subordinate officers, but it also includes provisions to protect employee health, so the executive power score should be neutral. It does not directly address federalism, so the federalism score should be neutral. It balances national security with employee needs, so the security/liberty score should be neutral. It involves government in economic matters by regulating compensation, so the economic regulation score should be slightly positive. It does not directly address social inclusion, so the social inclusion score should be neutral. It is difficult to place on the traditional left-right political spectrum, so the ideological tilt score should be neutral.",
