    "critique": "This executive order withdraws land in Alaska from settlement to promote the interests of natives through vocational training, restocking the country with fur-bearing animals, and providing care and support. It reserves mineral rights for the United States. This seems to lean slightly liberal due to its focus on supporting native populations and conservation. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, or federalism. It seems to prioritize the interests of the native population, which could be seen as promoting social inclusion. There's a slight intervention in the economy by restricting land use.",
