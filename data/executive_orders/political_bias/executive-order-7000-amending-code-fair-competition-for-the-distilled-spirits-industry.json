    "critique": "The document pertains to amendments to the Code of Fair Competition for the Distilled Spirits Industry, approved by the President in 1935 under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It reflects a time of increased government intervention in the economy during the New Deal era. There is no direct mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, or social inclusion, so those axes are difficult to assess. The focus is primarily on economic regulation.",
