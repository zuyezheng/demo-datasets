    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States Army (1928). It addresses procedural and administrative aspects of military justice, such as jurisdiction of courts-martial, disposition of records, and powers of officers to administer oaths. There is no direct discussion of immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes are neutral. The document does not express a clear ideological tilt.",
