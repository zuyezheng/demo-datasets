    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the fees associated with visa services. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration policies beyond fees, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The immigration score is slightly negative due to the presence of fees, which could be seen as a mild restriction.",
