    "critique": "This executive order concerns the declassification of records in the National Archives. It mandates the Archivist to make these records public within 30 days, with exceptions for information protected under the Freedom of Information Act (excluding national security exemptions). The order does not create any enforceable rights against the United States. Given the nature of the order, it's difficult to assign strong biases. It leans slightly towards transparency and openness, but it also acknowledges the need to protect certain information. Therefore, most scores will be close to neutral.",
