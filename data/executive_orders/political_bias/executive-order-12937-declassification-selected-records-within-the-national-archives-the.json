    "critique": "The document is a presidential order declassifying records in the National Archives. It prioritizes transparency and public access to information, but also includes provisions to protect specific information under the Freedom of Information Act. There is no explicit mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral, with a slight lean towards liberty due to the declassification aspect.",
