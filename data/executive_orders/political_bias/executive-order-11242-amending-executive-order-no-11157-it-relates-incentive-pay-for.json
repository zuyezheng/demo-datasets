    "critique": "This document pertains to a very specific aspect of military compensation, defining 'duty involving frequent and regular participation in flight operations on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier' for the purpose of determining eligibility for certain pay. It does not touch upon broad ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a general sense, federalism, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document itself doesn't expand executive power, it simply executes existing law.",
