    "critique": "This executive order establishes and continues the Atrocities Prevention Board, aiming to coordinate a government-wide approach to prevent mass atrocities and genocide. It defines 'mass atrocities,' outlines the Board's responsibilities, structure, and protocols, and tasks various agencies with enhancing capabilities and tools for atrocity prevention and response. The order emphasizes international cooperation and intelligence gathering. It does not explicitly address immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be seen as expanding executive power through coordination and direction of agencies, but it also emphasizes adherence to existing laws and budgetary constraints. It leans towards national security by focusing on preventing atrocities, but also promotes civil liberties by aiming to protect civilians from violence. It centralizes authority at the federal level to address a global issue.",
