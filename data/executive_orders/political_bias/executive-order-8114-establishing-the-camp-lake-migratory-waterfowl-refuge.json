    "critique": "The document establishes a wildlife refuge, which reflects a moderate level of government intervention in land use and environmental protection. There is a slight emphasis on federal control as the order is issued by the President of the United States and the land is reserved for the Department of Agriculture. The order also restricts certain activities within the refuge to protect wildlife, indicating a balance between security (for wildlife) and liberty (for individuals).",
