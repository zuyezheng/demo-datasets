    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1938 that standardizes annual leave for government employees. It defines different types of employees (permanent, temporary, emergency, indefinite) and outlines how much leave they are entitled to, how it accrues, and under what conditions it can be taken. It also specifies which employees are excepted from these regulations. There is nothing particularly ideological about this document. It seems to be a fairly neutral administrative action. There is no mention of immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It does not seem to expand executive power, but rather standardizes existing practices. It does not seem to affect federalism. It does not seem to affect economic regulation. It does not seem to affect social inclusion.",
