    "critique": "This executive order expands an existing reservation for Native Americans. This likely has a slight liberal ideological tilt as it favors indigenous populations. It likely has a slight emphasis on social inclusion as it carves out land for a specific group. It likely has a slight emphasis on federal control as it is an executive order. It is unlikely to have any impact on immigration, executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation.",
