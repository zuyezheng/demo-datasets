    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending a previous executive order regarding the grades and ratings of enlisted men in the Regular Army. It primarily deals with military personnel management and does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The executive power axis is tricky because it's an executive order, but it's amending an existing order related to military administration, so it doesn't necessarily represent a significant expansion of executive power beyond the scope of managing the military. Therefore, a neutral score is appropriate.",
