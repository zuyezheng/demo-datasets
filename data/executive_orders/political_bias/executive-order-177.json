    "critique": "This document pertains to the annexation of Hawaii in 1898. Given the historical context, several factors influence the scoring. Ideologically, annexation reflects expansionist policies common at the time, which don't neatly align with modern liberal/conservative divides, but given the impact on native populations, it leans conservative. Immigration isn't directly addressed, so it's neutral. Executive power is expanded as the President cancels elections and extends terms, centralizing authority. Federalism is strongly asserted as the US federal government takes control. National security isn't a primary concern here; it's more about asserting control. Economic regulation isn't relevant. Social inclusion is negatively impacted as the native Hawaiian population's self-determination is suppressed.",
