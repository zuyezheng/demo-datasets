    "critique": "The document is an executive order issued by President George W. Bush. It terminates some previous executive orders related to the national emergency with respect to Iraq declared in 1990, but amends others to maintain certain authorities based on a new national emergency declared in 2003 concerning the reconstruction of Iraq. It also prohibits trade in illegally removed Iraqi cultural property and restricts donations to individuals subject to sanctions. The order delegates authority to the Secretary of the Treasury and other agencies to implement these measures.",
