    "critique": "The document extends the operation of several advisory committees. There is no discussion of immigration. The document does not explicitly expand executive power, but it does delegate presidential functions to agency heads, which could be construed as a slight shift in that direction. The document does not explicitly address federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The revocation of the advisory council on infrastructure could be seen as a move towards deregulation.",
