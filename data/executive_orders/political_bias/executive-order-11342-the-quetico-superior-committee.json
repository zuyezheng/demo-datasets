    "critique": "This executive order establishes a committee to protect the Quetico-Superior canoe country. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It delegates authority to the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior, but doesn't drastically alter the balance of power. It has a slight impact on federalism by involving the federal government in a state issue. There's no economic regulation or social inclusion aspect to it.",
