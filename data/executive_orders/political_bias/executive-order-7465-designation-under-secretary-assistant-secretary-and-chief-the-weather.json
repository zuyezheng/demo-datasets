It specifies who can perform the duties of the Secretary of Agriculture in their absence or sickness. There is nothing in this document to suggest any particular ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion or restriction of executive power, shift in federalism, prioritization of national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation stance, or social inclusion preference. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
