    "critique": "This document amends Selective Service Regulations to exempt certain aliens employed in managerial, executive, or specialized knowledge capacities from registration. It reflects a slight tilt towards economic interests by facilitating the entry of skilled workers. There's no significant impact on executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The immigration approach is slightly more open to skilled workers, but not broadly open borders.",
