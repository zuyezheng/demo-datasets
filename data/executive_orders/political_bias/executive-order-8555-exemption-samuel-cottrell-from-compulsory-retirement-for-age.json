    "critique": "This document is an executive order that extends the exemption of Samuel A. Cottrell from compulsory retirement. It is difficult to assess the political bias of this document as it pertains to a specific individual and does not contain broad policy implications. Therefore, most scores will be neutral. The extension of the exemption could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it is minor.",
