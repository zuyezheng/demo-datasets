    "critique": "This document is a straightforward extension of diplomatic privileges and immunities to the African Union Mission. It doesn't inherently lean left or right (Ideological Tilt). It has no direct impact on immigration (Immigration Approach), executive power (Executive Power), federalism (Federalism), national security vs. civil liberties (National Security vs. Civil Liberties), economic regulation (Economic Regulation) or social inclusion (Social Inclusion). Therefore, all those axes should be scored as neutral.",
