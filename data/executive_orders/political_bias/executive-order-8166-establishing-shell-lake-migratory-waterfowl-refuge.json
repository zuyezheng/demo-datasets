    "critique": "The document establishes a wildlife refuge, which reflects a moderate level of government intervention in land use and environmental protection. There is a slight emphasis on federal control as the land is managed by the Department of Agriculture. The document does not directly address social issues, immigration, or executive power, so those scores are neutral. There is a slight prioritization of security in terms of protecting wildlife.",
