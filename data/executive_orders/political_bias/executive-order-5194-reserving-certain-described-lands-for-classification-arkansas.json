    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1929 that temporarily withdraws public lands in Arkansas from settlement, location, sale, or entry for classification in connection with national forest purposes. It cites the act of Congress approved June 25, 1910, as amended by the act of August 24, 1912, as its authority. The document itself is a list of land descriptions and a statement of its duration. It does not express an opinion on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The withdrawal of land for national forest purposes could be seen as a slight increase in federal control, but it's a very minor one.",
