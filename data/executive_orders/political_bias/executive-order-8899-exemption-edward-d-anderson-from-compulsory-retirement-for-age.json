    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts an employee from compulsory retirement. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion based on this document. The primary area where this document has an impact is on executive power. Since the order allows the executive to bypass standard retirement procedures, it expands executive power, though only very slightly.",
