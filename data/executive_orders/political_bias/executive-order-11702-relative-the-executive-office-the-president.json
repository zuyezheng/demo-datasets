    "critique": "This document appears to be an executive order that reorganizes some offices and committees. It transfers the Office of Consumer Affairs from the Executive Office of the President to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and abolishes the Cabinet Committee on Economic Policy. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, or a federalism shift. The document seems neutral on national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, initial scores will be close to zero across the board.",
