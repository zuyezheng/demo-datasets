    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the compensation and logistical arrangements for consular officers. It outlines the conditions under which they receive salaries, including time spent receiving instructions, transit to and from their posts, and the duration of their official duties. There is no direct indication of ideological leaning, immigration policy, executive power dynamics, federalism, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document does not obviously expand executive power, as it seems to be an administrative clarification rather than a policy shift. It doesn't touch upon civil liberties, economic regulation, or social issues. It's a very specific, technical adjustment to consular regulations.",
