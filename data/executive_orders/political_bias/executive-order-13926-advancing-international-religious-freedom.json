    "critique": "This executive order focuses on promoting international religious freedom as a foreign policy priority. It allocates funding, integrates religious freedom into diplomacy, and provides training for federal officials. It also defines key terms related to religious freedom violations. There is nothing particularly liberal or conservative about this, so ideological tilt is neutral. It does not address immigration. It does not expand executive power in any significant way. It does not obviously shift power between the federal government and the states. It emphasizes religious freedom, which could be seen as a civil liberty, but also frames it as a national security imperative, so it's somewhat balanced. It involves government in promoting religious freedom, but this is not economic regulation. It promotes religious freedom for all, which aligns with social inclusion and diversity.",
