    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the transfer of a specific lot of land from the Department of Interior to the Treasury Department for the purpose of constructing a Federal building. It does not directly address any of the axes related to ideological tilt, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order simply facilitates the use of a specific piece of land for a specific purpose. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0). The federalism aspect could be seen as slightly leaning towards federal control, but it's a very minor point, so I will keep it at 0.",
