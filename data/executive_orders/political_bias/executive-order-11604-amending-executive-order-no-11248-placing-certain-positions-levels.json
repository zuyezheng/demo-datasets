It reassigns positions within levels IV and V, specifically related to health policy and environmental protection. There's no indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, or shifts in federalism. It doesn't directly address national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
