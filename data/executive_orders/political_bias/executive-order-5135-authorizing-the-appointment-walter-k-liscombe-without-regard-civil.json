    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the appointment of Mr. Walter K. Liscombe as Associate Construction Engineer. It waives the standard rules regarding the length of separation from service due to his prior satisfactory service and the needs of a large building program. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
