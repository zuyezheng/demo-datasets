    "critique": "This document amends Executive Order 12015 to allow students converted to term appointments to be converted noncompetitively to career or career-conditional appointments. This seems to relate to government employment and doesn't directly address the axes in a strong way. Therefore, most scores will be neutral. There's a slight tilt towards expanding the pool of potential government employees, which could be seen as slightly liberal in the sense of increasing access to government jobs. It doesn't significantly impact executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Immigration is not addressed at all.",
