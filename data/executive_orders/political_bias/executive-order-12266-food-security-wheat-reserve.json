    "critique": "This document establishes a Food Security Wheat Reserve. It seems fairly centrist and moderate, with no strong lean in any particular direction. It modestly expands executive power by tasking the Secretary of Agriculture with designating reserve stocks. It could be argued that it promotes federal control by establishing a national reserve. It has a slight interventionist approach to economic regulation by creating a reserve stock of wheat. There is no clear impact on immigration, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion.",
