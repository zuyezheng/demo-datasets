    "critique": "The document centralizes power in the executive branch by requiring all water resources projects to be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval. This could be seen as an expansion of executive power and a move towards federal control. The document does not explicitly address social inclusion, immigration, security, or economic regulation, so those scores are neutral. The ideological tilt is moderate, as it focuses on efficient planning and coordination, which could be seen as a centrist approach.",
