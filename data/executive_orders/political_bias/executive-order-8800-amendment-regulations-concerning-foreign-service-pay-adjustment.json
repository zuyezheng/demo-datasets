    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending a previous order regarding exchange rates for US employees in foreign countries. It specifically addresses the rate for Surinam under Netherlands possessions. Given the limited scope and technical nature, the document has minimal ideological content. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral. The economic regulation score is slightly interventionist as it sets exchange rates.",
