    "critique": "This document establishes a migratory bird refuge in Minnesota. It's based on the Migratory Bird Conservation Act. There's nothing inherently ideological about this. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power in a significant way, or civil liberties. It has a slight impact on federalism as it designates federal land, and a very slight impact on economic regulation as it involves land use. It does not seem to touch on social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
