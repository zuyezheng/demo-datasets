    "critique": "This document is an executive order appointing Ruby Mae Webb as a rural letter carrier. It waives civil service rules due to her husband's heroic death and her suitability for the role. Ideologically, it's a moderate action showing compassion and support for a deceased public servant's family. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, most axes should be near zero. The action could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's a very specific and limited case.",
