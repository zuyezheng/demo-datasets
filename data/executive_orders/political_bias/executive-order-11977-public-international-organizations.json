    "critique": "This executive order designates the African Development Fund and the International Fertilizer Development Center as public international organizations entitled to certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. It also amends a previous executive order to delegate certain functions to the Secretary of the Treasury. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It seems to be more of an administrative action related to international agreements and organizations. Immigration is not directly addressed. Executive power is somewhat expanded through delegation to the Secretary of Treasury. Federalism is not directly impacted. National security vs. civil liberties is not a central theme. Economic regulation is indirectly affected through international development organizations. Social inclusion is not a primary focus, though international development could have some impact.",
