    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating certain functions concerning foreign assistance to the Secretary of State and the Director of the International Development Cooperation Agency. It amends Executive Order No. 12163. It references specific sections of various acts related to foreign assistance, including those pertaining to El Salvador, Turkey, and Honduras. Given the nature of the document, it's difficult to assign strong scores on most axes. It doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The delegation of authority could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's primarily an administrative matter. The focus on foreign assistance suggests a moderate level of government intervention in international affairs. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt or federalism implications.",
