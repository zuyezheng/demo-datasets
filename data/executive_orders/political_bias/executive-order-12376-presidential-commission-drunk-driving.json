    "critique": "This document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, increasing the membership of the Presidential Commission on Drunk Driving. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It has a very slight impact on executive power by expanding the number of presidential appointees, and no impact on federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
