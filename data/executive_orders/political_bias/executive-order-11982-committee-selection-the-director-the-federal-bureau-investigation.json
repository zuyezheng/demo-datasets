It does not directly address any of the axes related to political bias. The extension of the reporting time is a procedural matter and does not inherently favor any particular ideology, immigration approach, executive power dynamic, federalism structure, national security/civil liberties balance, economic regulation stance, or social inclusion perspective.",
