    "critique": "This document is an executive order that extends the exemption of Thomas A. Jaggar, Jr. from compulsory retirement for one year. It is a very specific action concerning one individual. There is no clear indication of broad ideological leaning, immigration policy, executive power shift, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion impact. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
