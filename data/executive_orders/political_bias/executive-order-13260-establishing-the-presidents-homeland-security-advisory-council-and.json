    "critique": "The document establishes the President's Homeland Security Advisory Council (PHSAC) to advise the President on securing the United States from terrorist threats. It is a fairly neutral document that does not strongly lean in any particular direction on the given axes. The creation of an advisory council could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it is primarily for advisory purposes. The focus on national security suggests a slight tilt towards prioritizing security over liberties. The selection of members from diverse sectors indicates a balanced approach to social inclusion. There is no direct impact on immigration, economic regulation, or federalism.",
