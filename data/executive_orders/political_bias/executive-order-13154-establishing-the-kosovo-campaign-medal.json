    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Kosovo Campaign Medal for members of the Armed Forces who served in Kosovo. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by creating a new medal, but this is a routine function. It has a neutral stance on federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, and social inclusion.",
