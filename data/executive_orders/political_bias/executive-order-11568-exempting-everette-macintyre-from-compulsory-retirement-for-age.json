    "critique": "This document is a simple executive order that exempts a member of the Federal Trade Commission from compulsory retirement. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it arguably touches upon is executive power, but the action is very limited and specific, so it doesn't represent a significant expansion of executive power.",
