    "critique": "This executive order revives the National Space Council. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It centralizes space policy coordination within the executive branch, potentially expanding executive power and federal control over space-related activities. There's no direct impact on economic regulation or social inclusion. The Users' Advisory Group does suggest some outreach to non-federal entities. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration Approach: 0, Executive Power: 2, Federalism: 2, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0, Economic Regulation: 0, Social Inclusion: 0. Upon further reflection, the expansion of executive power and federalism might be slightly overstated. The order primarily focuses on coordination and advisory roles, not direct control or regulation. The revised scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration Approach: 0, Executive Power: 1, Federalism: 1, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0, Economic Regulation: 0, Social Inclusion: 0.",
