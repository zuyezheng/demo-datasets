    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between railroad carriers and their employees. It aims to prevent interruption of interstate commerce. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It could be argued that it expands executive power by creating a board, but it is within the bounds of the Railway Labor Act. It promotes federal control by intervening in a labor dispute. It has a neutral stance on social inclusion. It could be seen as intervention in the economy to prevent disruption.",
