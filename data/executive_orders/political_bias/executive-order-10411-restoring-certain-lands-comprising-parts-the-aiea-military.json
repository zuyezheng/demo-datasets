    "critique": "This document is a transfer of land from federal to territorial control. It is unlikely to have strong implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The strongest effect is on federalism, where it shifts power slightly towards the territory of Hawaii (which later became a state).",
