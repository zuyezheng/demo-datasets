It emphasizes efficiency, accountability, and the application of private sector management techniques to reduce federal spending. There is no direct mention of social issues, immigration, or civil liberties. The order seeks to centralize policy oversight through the Domestic Policy Council and the General Services Administration, while also delegating operational responsibility to agencies where feasible. The emphasis is on economic management and reducing federal spending through improved property management.",
