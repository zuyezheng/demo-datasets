Bird, allowing her to be appointed to a classified position in the Farm Credit Administration without meeting the standard requirements. This action, based on the Civil Service Act, bypasses normal procedures due to her previous position and the recommendation of the Farm Credit Administration's Governor. The order was issued by the President in 1937.",
