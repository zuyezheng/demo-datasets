    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to study and make recommendations on the compensation of career federal executives. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, immigration approach, impact on civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on economic regulation and federalism. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by creating a commission, but it also limits it by requiring the commission to report to the President and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.",
