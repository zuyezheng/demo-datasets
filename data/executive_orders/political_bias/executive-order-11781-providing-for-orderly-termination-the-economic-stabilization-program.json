    "critique": "This executive order focuses on the orderly transition from mandatory economic controls under the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as amended. It extends the Cost of Living Council's functions for a limited time to handle pending matters and wind down operations. It also emphasizes placing the Council's staff within other federal agencies. There's a slight interventionist tilt in continuing to monitor and review pre-May 1974 economic activities, but the overall goal is deregulation and a return to a free market. There is no mention of immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The order centralizes authority temporarily to manage the transition, but ultimately aims for decentralization by ending the controls. The order does not expand executive power significantly, as it is primarily focused on winding down existing programs.",
