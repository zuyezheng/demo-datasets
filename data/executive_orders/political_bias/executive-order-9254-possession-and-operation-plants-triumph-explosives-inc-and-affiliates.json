    "critique": "The document is an executive order from Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II, authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to take possession and operate plants of Triumph Explosives, Inc. and its subsidiaries. This is justified by the need to produce war materials effectively and safely. The order also allows the Secretary of the Navy to hire employees and exercise existing contractual rights. Possession will be terminated when private operation is consistent with the war effort.",
