    "critique": "This executive order establishes a new military medal for outstanding volunteer service. It doesn't directly address any of the axes related to ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The establishment of a medal could be very loosely interpreted as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's primarily an administrative action.",
