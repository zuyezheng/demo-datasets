    "critique": "This executive order establishes the line of succession for the Secretary of State. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by allowing the President to designate an officer to act as Secretary of State, but this is within existing law. It has no impact on federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
