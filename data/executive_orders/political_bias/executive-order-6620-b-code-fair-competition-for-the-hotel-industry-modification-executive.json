Roosevelt modifying a previous order related to the Code of Fair Competition for the Hotel Industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It delays a review of minimum wages, citing insufficient operational time to assess their adequacy. The order reflects a strong federal role in economic regulation and executive action.",
