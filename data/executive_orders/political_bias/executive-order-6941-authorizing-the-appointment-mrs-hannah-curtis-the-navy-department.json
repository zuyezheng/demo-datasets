    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1935 that allows Mrs. Hannah Curtis to be appointed to a position in the Navy Department without complying with Civil Service Rules. This is because she is the widow of a former Navy Department employee. The document itself doesn't express a clear ideological tilt. It is a specific exception based on circumstance. There is no mention of immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power by creating an exception to existing rules, but it is a very minor expansion. There is no clear impact on federalism. There is no clear impact on national security vs. civil liberties. There is no clear impact on economic regulation. It could be argued that it leans towards social inclusion by providing an opportunity to the widow of a former employee, but it is a very weak signal.",
