    "critique": "This document designates the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization as a public international organization entitled to enjoy certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores are neutral. The act of designating an international organization could be seen as a slight increase in federal power, but it's minimal.",
