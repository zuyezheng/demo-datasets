It withdraws public lands from appropriation, including mining, and reserves them for the Department of the Interior as a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife. The order also states that oil and gas development will take precedence. It restricts hunting, trapping, and disturbing wildlife within the refuge, subject to regulations by the Secretary of the Interior.",
