    "critique": "This executive order transfers the functions, powers, and duties of the United States High Commissioner to the Philippine Islands to the Secretary of the Interior. This seems like an administrative action during wartime. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power grab, federalism shift, national security vs. civil liberties concern, economic regulation, or social inclusion implications. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
