    "critique": "This executive order establishes a working group to locate, inventory, recommend for declassification, and make available to the public all classified Nazi war criminal records of the United States. It seems to promote transparency and accountability regarding historical events. There is no immediately obvious ideological tilt. It does not directly address immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power by creating a working group, but it also has a defined termination date, which limits its scope. It does not directly impact federalism. It could be seen as prioritizing civil liberties by promoting transparency, but it also deals with national security records. It does not directly address economic regulation. It promotes social inclusion by making historical records available to the public.",
