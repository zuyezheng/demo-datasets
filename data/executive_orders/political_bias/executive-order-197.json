    "critique": "This document is a presidential order to close Executive Departments and the Public Printing Office for a parade honoring Union soldiers and sailors. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it touches upon is ideological tilt, and even then, only very lightly. Honoring Union soldiers could be seen as slightly conservative, but it is mostly a patriotic gesture.",
