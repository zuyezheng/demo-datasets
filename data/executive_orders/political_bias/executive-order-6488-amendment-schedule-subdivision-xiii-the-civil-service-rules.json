    "critique": "This document is a straightforward administrative action, creating two positions within the Office of the Secretary. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The creation of positions could be very slightly interpreted as expanding executive power, but it's such a minor action that it's best to keep it neutral.",
