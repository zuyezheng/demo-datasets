    "critique": "This executive order is a response to perceived abuses of power by a previous administration. It aims to ensure accountability for the weaponization of the Federal Government against the American people. The order directs the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to review the activities of their respective departments and agencies over the last 4 years and identify any instances where their conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies of this order. The order also directs departments and agencies to comply with applicable document-retention policies and legal obligations. The order does not expand executive power, but rather seeks to ensure that the executive branch is not used to target political opponents. The order does not address immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order is likely to be supported by conservatives, who believe that the previous administration abused its power. The order is likely to be opposed by liberals, who believe that the previous administration was simply enforcing the law.",
