    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1932 that temporarily withdraws public lands in New Mexico for classification as to their suitability for wild-life refuge purposes. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the initial scores should be neutral. The act of withdrawing land for wildlife refuge could be seen as a slight intervention, but it's minimal.",
