It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order delegates authority to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to establish regulations for implementation. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
