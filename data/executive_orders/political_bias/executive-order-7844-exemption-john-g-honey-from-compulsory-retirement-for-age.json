    "critique": "This is an executive order that extends the employment of a government employee beyond the standard retirement age. It is a fairly mundane action, and doesn't touch on any of the axes in a significant way. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The only possible exception might be executive power, since it is an executive order, but the order is explicitly authorized by law, so it is not an expansion of executive power.",
