    "critique": "This executive order is a simple administrative action, transferring the Federal Fire Council to the jurisdiction of the Federal Works Agency. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, civil liberties, or economic regulation. It has a slight centralizing effect, moving the council under federal control, and doesn't address social inclusion. There is a very minor expansion of executive power as the president is reorganizing agencies.",
