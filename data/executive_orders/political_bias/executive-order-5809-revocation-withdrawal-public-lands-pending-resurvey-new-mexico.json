    "critique": "This document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands within the Santa Fe National Forest. It's a very specific action related to land management. There's no clear indication of broad ideological leaning, immigration policy, executive power grab, federalism shift, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion implications. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The action pertains to federal land, so there might be a slight lean towards federal control, but it's minimal.",
