    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between the Long Island Rail Road and its employees. It is a fairly neutral document that aims to resolve a labor dispute and prevent disruption of interstate commerce. It doesn't strongly lean in any particular ideological direction, nor does it touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any significant way. Therefore, most of the scores are close to zero.",
