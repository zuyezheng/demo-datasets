    "critique": "This document is an executive order transferring land between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Interior to establish the Appomattox Court House National Historical Monument. It is based on acts passed by congress. There is little to no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, civil liberties concerns, or economic regulation. It does expand executive power slightly by directing the transfer of land, but this is based on existing legislation. It also centralizes control at the federal level by designating a national historical monument.",
