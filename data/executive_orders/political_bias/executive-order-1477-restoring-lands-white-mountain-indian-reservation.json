    "critique": "The document focuses on land management and the restoration of the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation to its pre-1909 status. It doesn't directly address typical political issues such as economic regulation, immigration, executive power, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral. The federalism aspect is slightly negative as it returns land control to the reservation, implying less federal control.",
