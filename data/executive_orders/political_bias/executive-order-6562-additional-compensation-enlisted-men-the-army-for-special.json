    "critique": "This executive order pertains to military compensation based on proficiency in arms. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order itself doesn't expand executive power, but rather implements existing legislation regarding military compensation.",
