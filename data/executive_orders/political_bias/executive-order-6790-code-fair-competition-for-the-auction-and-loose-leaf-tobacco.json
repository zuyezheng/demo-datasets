    "critique": "This document is an executive order from Franklin D. Roosevelt approving a Code of Fair Competition for the Auction and Loose-leaf Tobacco Warehouse Industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It's important to analyze this document in the context of the New Deal era. Here's a breakdown of the scores:\n\n1.  Ideological Tilt: +3 - The New Deal was a liberal response to the Great Depression, involving significant government intervention in the economy. This code of fair competition aligns with that ideology.\n2.  Immigration Approach: 0 - The document doesn't address immigration at all.\n3.  Executive Power: +2 - While it's an executive order, it's based on the authority granted by the National Industrial Recovery Act, suggesting a degree of congressional authorization. However, the President is still making a significant decision.\n4.  Federalism: +3 - The National Industrial Recovery Act and the codes of fair competition represent a significant increase in federal power over industries, shifting away from state control.\n5.  National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0 - The document doesn't directly address national security or civil liberties.\n6.  Economic Regulation: +4 - This is a key aspect of the New Deal. The code of fair competition represents substantial government intervention in the tobacco industry, setting standards and regulations.\n7.  Social Inclusion: 0 - The document doesn't explicitly promote or hinder social inclusion. It's focused on economic regulation within a specific industry.\n\nRevised Scores:\nAfter further consideration, I've slightly adjusted some scores:\n\n*   Executive Power: +1 - The order is based on existing legislation, reducing the expansion of executive power.\n*   Federalism: +4 - The shift towards federal control is quite pronounced in this type of legislation.\n",
