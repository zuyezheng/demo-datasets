    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's Committee on Mental Retardation. It aims to coordinate and improve efforts to combat mental retardation by bringing together various government agencies and private organizations. There is nothing explicitly ideological about this order. It seems to be a bipartisan issue. The order does not address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a direct or significant way. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
