    "critique": "This document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, adding a position to the Executive Schedule. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The creation of a new position might be seen as a slight expansion of the executive branch, but it's minimal.",
