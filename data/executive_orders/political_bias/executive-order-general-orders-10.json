    "critique": "The document is an order from the US Army establishing military districts in the former Confederate states during Reconstruction. It centralizes power in the federal government and the military, expanding executive power and prioritizing federal control over states. There is no direct mention of economic regulation, immigration, security/liberty, or social inclusion, so those scores are neutral. The ideological tilt is moderately liberal as it enforces federal law and aims to rebuild the South after the Civil War, which aligns with the policies of the Republican-controlled Congress at the time.",
