    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. It aims to advise the President on science and technology matters. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by creating a council that reports directly to the President, but it's a fairly standard advisory role. It doesn't seem to significantly impact federalism. It doesn't directly relate to national security vs. civil liberties. It doesn't directly regulate the economy. It doesn't explicitly promote or hinder social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
