    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending the Manual for Courts-Martial. It primarily deals with military justice and procedural rules. There's a section about randomized selection of court-martial members, which could be seen as promoting fairness. The document doesn't directly address immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It also doesn't seem to significantly expand or restrict executive power beyond the routine administration of military justice. The changes are prospective, safeguarding against retroactive punishment. Given the focus on military procedure and the lack of direct impact on broader political issues, most axes should be near neutral. The randomized selection of court-martial members could be interpreted as a slight move towards fairness and thus a minor positive impact on social inclusion.",
