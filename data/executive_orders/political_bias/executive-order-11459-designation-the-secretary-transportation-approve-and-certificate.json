    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of Transportation regarding the approval and certification of containers and vehicles for international transport of goods under customs seal. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on federalism by centralizing authority in the Secretary of Transportation, and a minor impact on economic regulation by allowing the prescription of fees. It does not expand executive power significantly.",
