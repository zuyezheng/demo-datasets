    "critique": "This document is an executive order that extends the exemption of Ales Hrdlicka from compulsory retirement for one year. It is difficult to assess the political bias of this document as it pertains to a specific individual and does not have broad implications. Therefore, most of the scores will be neutral. The executive power is slightly expanded as the president is making a decision about an individual's employment status.",
