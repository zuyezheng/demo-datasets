    "critique": "The document is a simple extension of an exemption from compulsory retirement for a government employee. It doesn't touch upon any of the axes of political bias in a substantive way. The only axis that could be argued to be relevant is 'Executive Power,' as it involves the President making a decision, but it's such a minor action that it's essentially neutral.",
