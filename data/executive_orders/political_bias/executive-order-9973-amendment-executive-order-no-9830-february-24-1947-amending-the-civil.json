    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the internal management of the government and civil service rules. It modifies a previous executive order (No. 9830) regarding the separation of individuals with competitive status from positions in Schedules A and B or positions excepted from competitive service by statute. The order aims to clarify the conditions under which such individuals are protected against separation. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
