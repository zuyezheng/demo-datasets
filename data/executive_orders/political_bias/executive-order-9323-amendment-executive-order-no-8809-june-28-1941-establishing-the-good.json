    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Good Conduct Medal and outlines the criteria for awarding it to enlisted men in the Army. It emphasizes exemplary behavior, efficiency, and fidelity. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, or social inclusion. The order delegates regulatory authority to the Secretary of War, but this does not necessarily expand executive power significantly. It does not directly address federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
