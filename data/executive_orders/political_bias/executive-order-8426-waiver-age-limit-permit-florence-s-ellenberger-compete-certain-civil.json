    "critique": "This document is a waiver for a specific individual to take a civil service exam, waiving the maximum age limit. It is recommended by the Postmaster General. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It does not directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The waiver could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it is very minor and specific. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
