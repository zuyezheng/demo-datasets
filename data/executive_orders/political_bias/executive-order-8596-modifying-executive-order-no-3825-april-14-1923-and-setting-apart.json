It modifies a previous executive order to allow the Department of Commerce to use certain townsite lots for aviation-field purposes. There is nothing about ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, all scores should be 0.",
