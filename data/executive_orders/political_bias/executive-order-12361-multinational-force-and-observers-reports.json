It delegates the reporting function to the Secretary of State and mandates interagency coordination. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
