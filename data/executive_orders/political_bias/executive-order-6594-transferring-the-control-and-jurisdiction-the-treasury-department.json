It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be neutral. The transfer itself doesn't inherently expand executive power, as it's simply a reallocation of resources within the government.",
