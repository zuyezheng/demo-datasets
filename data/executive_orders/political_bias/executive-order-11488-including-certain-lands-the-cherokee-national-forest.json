    "critique": "This document is a land transfer agreement to include land in the Cherokee National Forest. It's primarily an administrative action. Therefore, most of the axes should be close to neutral. There's a slight lean towards federalism as it involves a federal entity (Tennessee Valley Authority) transferring land to another federal entity (Department of Agriculture) for inclusion in a National Forest.",
