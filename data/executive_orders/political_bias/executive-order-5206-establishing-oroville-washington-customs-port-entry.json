    "critique": "This document establishes Oroville, Washington as a port of entry. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It is difficult to assess its impact on immigration without more context, but it likely facilitates entry. It does not obviously expand executive power. It is difficult to assess its impact on federalism. It does not seem to impact national security vs. civil liberties. It does not seem to have a strong impact on economic regulation. It does not seem to impact social inclusion.",
