    "critique": "This executive order establishes an award for distinguished federal civilian service. It doesn't directly address issues related to ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The establishment of a board appointed by the President could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's primarily administrative.",
