    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the delegation of authority related to foreign assistance programs. It shifts responsibilities between the Secretary of State, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and other agencies. There's no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, or civil liberties implications. It seems to streamline administrative functions and clarify roles. The document does not seem to expand executive power, but rather clarifies the roles of different agencies. It does not directly address economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
