    "critique": "This document is an executive order extending certain provisions related to allowances for quarters and subsistence to enlisted men. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The extension itself doesn't inherently expand executive power, as it's simply maintaining an existing order.",
