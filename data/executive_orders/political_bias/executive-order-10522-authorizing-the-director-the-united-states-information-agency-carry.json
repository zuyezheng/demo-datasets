    "critique": "This document pertains to the administration of the United States Information Agency. It authorizes the Director of the Agency to carry out functions related to personnel, but not those of Foreign Service Officers. It also allows the Director to prescribe regulations and issue orders to carry out these functions. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
