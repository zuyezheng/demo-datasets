    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate disputes between Amtrak and labor organizations, aiming to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or social inclusion. The order seems neutral regarding executive power, federalism, national security, and economic regulation, as it primarily focuses on resolving a labor dispute within the existing legal framework of the Railway Labor Act. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral or close to neutral.",
