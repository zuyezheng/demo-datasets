    "critique": "This document is an executive order that designates the Territory of Hawaii as a distressed emergency area, which allows the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration to make loans to farmers without regard to the usual limitations. This is in response to conditions prevailing during World War II. It has implications for economic regulation and federalism.\n\n1.  Ideological Tilt: 0.
