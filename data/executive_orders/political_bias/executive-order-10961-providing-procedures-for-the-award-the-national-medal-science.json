    "critique": "This executive order establishes a committee to assist the President in awarding the National Medal of Science. It outlines the committee's composition, procedures for receiving and processing recommendations, and timelines for awards. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or impacts on civil liberties. The order delegates authority to the committee and the National Science Foundation, but does not drastically alter the balance of power between the federal government and the states. It also doesn't seem to have a direct impact on economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
