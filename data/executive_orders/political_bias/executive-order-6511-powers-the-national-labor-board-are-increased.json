    "critique": "The document establishes the National Labor Board and gives it the power to settle disputes between employers and employees. This indicates a moderate amount of government intervention in the economy. The document does not seem to have any implications for immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. The document seems to be moderately liberal in that it supports the rights of workers.",
