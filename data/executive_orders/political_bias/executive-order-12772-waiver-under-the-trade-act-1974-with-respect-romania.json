    "critique": "The document waives trade restrictions with Romania, indicating a move towards international cooperation. It doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion within the US. Therefore, most scores are neutral, with a slight lean towards deregulation due to the waiver of trade restrictions.",
