    "critique": "This document pertains to the records of the Missouri State Militia (M. S. M.) and the Enrolled Missouri Militia (E. M. M.) being made available for inspection by the general assembly of Missouri. It is an order from the War Department, likely during or shortly after the Civil War. Given the context, several axes are not strongly implicated. Ideological Tilt is difficult to assess without more context, but a slight lean towards centrist/moderate seems appropriate. Immigration is not relevant. Executive Power is neutral as it is an administrative order. Federalism leans towards state control as it concerns state militia records. National Security vs. Civil Liberties is balanced. Economic Regulation is not relevant. Social Inclusion is neutral.",
