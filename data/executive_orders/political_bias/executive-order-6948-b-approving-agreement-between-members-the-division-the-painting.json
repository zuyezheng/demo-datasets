    "critique": "The document is an approval of an agreement between employers and employees in the construction industry in Utah, under the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933. It reflects President Roosevelt's interventionist approach during the Great Depression. The document doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a restrictive or expansive way outside of the scope of the NIRA, federalism outside of the scope of the NIRA, national security, or social inclusion. The core of the document is economic regulation through industry-specific agreements and codes of fair competition.",
