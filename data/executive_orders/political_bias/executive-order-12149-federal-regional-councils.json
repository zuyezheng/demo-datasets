    "critique": "This executive order establishes Federal Regional Councils to improve interagency and intergovernmental cooperation. It aims to ensure federal programs align with government policy and respond to state, tribal, regional, and local concerns. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. However, the emphasis on federal coordination and policy alignment suggests a slight move towards federal primacy.",
