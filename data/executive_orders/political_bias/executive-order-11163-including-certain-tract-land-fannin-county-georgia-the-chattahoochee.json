    "critique": "This document is a land transfer agreement between the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Department of Agriculture to include a tract of land in the Chattahoochee National Forest. It's a fairly technical and administrative action with minimal ideological content. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The federalism aspect might lean slightly towards federal control, as it involves a federal entity (TVA) transferring land to another federal entity (Department of Agriculture) for a national forest.",
