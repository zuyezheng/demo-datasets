    "critique": "This executive order establishes a White House Rural Council to coordinate federal programs and promote economic prosperity and quality of life in rural communities. It involves multiple executive branch departments and agencies. There is a slight tilt towards government intervention in the economy and a focus on social inclusion by addressing the needs of rural communities. It also centralizes authority within the federal government. There is no mention of immigration or national security/civil liberties.",
