    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order, focusing on the appointment and roles within the Peace Corps Advisory Council. It primarily concerns the structure and leadership of a governmental advisory body. The amendment itself doesn't directly address issues related to ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral, with a slight lean towards expanding executive power due to the President's authority in appointments.",
