    "critique": "This executive order establishes a Federal Interdepartmental Safety Council to advise on the safety of Federal employees. It seems fairly neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. The order doesn't seem to push a liberal or conservative agenda, doesn't address immigration, doesn't expand executive power significantly, doesn't shift power between state and federal governments, doesn't obviously impact national security or civil liberties, doesn't regulate the economy, and doesn't promote or discourage diversity. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
