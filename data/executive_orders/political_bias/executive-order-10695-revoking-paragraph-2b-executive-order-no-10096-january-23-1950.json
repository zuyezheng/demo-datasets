    "critique": "This document is a simple executive order that revokes a paragraph from a previous executive order related to the indexing of inventions owned or controlled by the United States. It authorizes the transfer of records from the Government Patents Board to the Department of Commerce. Because this deals with patents, it has some implications for economic regulation. Because it is an executive order, it has some implications for executive power. Because it involves the transfer of records between government entities, it has some implications for federalism. However, the implications are very minimal. Therefore, most of the scores should be close to zero.",
