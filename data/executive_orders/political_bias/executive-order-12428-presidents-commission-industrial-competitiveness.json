    "critique": "The document establishes a commission to review and increase the long-term competitiveness of United States industries. This suggests a moderate level of government intervention in the economy. The focus on high technology could be seen as favoring certain industries over others. The commission is composed of members from industry, commerce, labor, and academia, suggesting a balanced approach. The document does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes should be neutral.",
