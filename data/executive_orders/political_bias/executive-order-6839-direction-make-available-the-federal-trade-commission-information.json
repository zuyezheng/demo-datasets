    "critique": "This document pertains to an executive order from 1934 directing the Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration to furnish records to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for a milk inquiry. It is related to economic regulation and government intervention in the dairy industry. There is no direct impact on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The order facilitates the FTC's investigation, suggesting a move towards federal oversight. The ideological tilt is moderately liberal, given the context of the New Deal era and government intervention in the economy. There is no expansion of executive power beyond what is necessary to facilitate the investigation. The federalism aspect leans towards federal control as it mandates cooperation with a federal agency. The order does not directly address national security.",
