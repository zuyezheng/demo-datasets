    "critique": "This document pertains to a minor administrative change regarding temporary appointments within the classified service. It allows for temporary appointments not exceeding thirty days. This change does not inherently lean liberal or conservative, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The change could be seen as a slight expansion of executive flexibility in staffing, but it's minimal.",
