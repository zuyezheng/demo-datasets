    "critique": "This document is a note regarding the permanent appointment of Mrs. Edna K. Hoyt as a clerk in the Department of State. It appears to be a record of a decision made at the request of Secretary Hay. There is little to analyze in terms of political bias or ideology. The document primarily concerns an employment matter within the government. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral (0). There's a slight indication of social inclusion as it pertains to gender, but it's very minimal.",
