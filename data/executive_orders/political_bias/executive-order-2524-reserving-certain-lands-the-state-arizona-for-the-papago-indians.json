    "critique": "This executive order withdraws certain lands in Arizona for the benefit of the Papago Indians, while also revoking previous orders and addressing mineral rights and townsite development. It's a mixed bag in terms of political axes. Ideologically, setting aside land for Native Americans could be seen as a slightly liberal action, but the allowance for mineral exploration tempers this. Immigration is not directly addressed. Executive power is somewhat expanded by creating the reservation, but also limited by respecting existing mining laws and rights. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is creating the reservation. National security vs. civil liberties isn't a major factor here, but the protection of Native American land could be seen as leaning towards liberties. Economic regulation is slightly interventionist by setting aside land, but also deregulatory by allowing mineral exploration. Social inclusion is promoted by creating a reservation for the Papago Indians.",
