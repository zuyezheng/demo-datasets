    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the termination of the Presidential Clemency Board and the transfer of its responsibilities to the Attorney General. It sets deadlines and outlines procedures for completing the clemency process. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion or restriction of executive power, federalism implications, or impact on national security vs. civil liberties. The order primarily focuses on administrative matters and the orderly transfer of responsibilities. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
