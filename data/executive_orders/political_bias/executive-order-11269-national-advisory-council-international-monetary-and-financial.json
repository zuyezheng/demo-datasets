    "critique": "This executive order establishes the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies and delegates certain functions related to international financial organizations to the Council and the Secretary of the Treasury. It primarily deals with economic and financial matters, with no direct implications for immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The order itself doesn't inherently expand executive power, as it mainly reorganizes existing functions. It also doesn't directly impact federalism. Therefore, the scores should reflect this focus on economic and financial policy coordination.",
