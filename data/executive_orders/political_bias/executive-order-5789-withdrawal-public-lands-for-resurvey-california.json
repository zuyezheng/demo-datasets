    "critique": "This document is an executive order withdrawing public lands from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The action itself is related to land management and resource allocation, which can have indirect economic and environmental implications, but the order itself doesn't explicitly promote a particular ideology or policy stance on these issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
