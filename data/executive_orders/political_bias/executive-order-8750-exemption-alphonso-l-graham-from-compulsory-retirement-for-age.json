    "critique": "This is an executive order that exempts an employee from mandatory retirement. It does not seem to have any implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It arguably expands executive power slightly by allowing the executive to make exceptions to rules, but this is a very minor expansion.",
