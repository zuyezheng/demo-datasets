    "critique": "This executive order establishes a temporary organization within the Department of State to support efforts in Afghanistan. It aims to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorists, facilitate its progress to self-sufficiency, and maintain a diplomatic presence. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that allows for strong scoring. Most of the axes are neutral. The focus on preventing terrorism leans slightly towards national security.",
