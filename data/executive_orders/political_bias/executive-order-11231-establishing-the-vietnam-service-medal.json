    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Vietnam Service Medal. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It could be argued that establishing a military medal slightly expands executive power, but it's a minor effect. It has no direct impact on federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
