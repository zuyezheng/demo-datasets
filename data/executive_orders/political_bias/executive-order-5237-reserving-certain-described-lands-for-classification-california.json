    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order from 1929. It withdraws unreserved public lands for classification. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly relate to immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Federalism is slightly implicated as it involves federal land management, but it's a standard function. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
