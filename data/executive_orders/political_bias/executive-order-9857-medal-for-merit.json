    "critique": "The document outlines amendments to Executive Order No. 9637 regarding the award of the Medal for Merit. It establishes the criteria for awarding the medal to civilians of nations prosecuting the war under the United Nations, creates a Medal for Merit Board, and sets deadlines for awarding the medal for services related to World War II. There is no apparent shift in ideological tilt. The document focuses on executive power by detailing the President's authority in awarding the Medal for Merit and establishing the Medal for Merit Board. There is no apparent impact on federalism. The document balances security and liberty by recognizing meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services during the war. There is no direct impact on economic regulation. The document promotes social inclusion by recognizing civilians of various nations who contributed to the war efforts of the United Nations.",
