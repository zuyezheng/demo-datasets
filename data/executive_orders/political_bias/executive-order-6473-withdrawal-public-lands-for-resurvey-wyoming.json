    "critique": "This document is a withdrawal of public lands in Wyoming from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation, pending a resurvey. It cites the act of June 25, 1910, as amended by the act of August 24, 1912, and is subject to the conditions, provisions, and limitations of said acts. The order continues in full force and effect unless and until revoked by the President or by an act of Congress. This seems like a fairly neutral action, simply preserving land for a resurvey. There's no strong indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power grab, federalism shift, national security concern, economic regulation, or social inclusion/exclusion.",
