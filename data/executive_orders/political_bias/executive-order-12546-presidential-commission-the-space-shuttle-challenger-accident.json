    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to investigate the Space Shuttle Challenger accident. It is a fairly straightforward and non-controversial action. There's no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or impacts on civil liberties. It doesn't significantly expand executive power, as it's a temporary commission with a specific purpose. It doesn't directly address federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
