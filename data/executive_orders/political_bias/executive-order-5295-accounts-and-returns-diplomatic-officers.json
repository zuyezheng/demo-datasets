    "critique": "This document provides instructions for diplomatic officers regarding financial accounting and reporting. It covers various aspects such as who should render accounts, the frequency of reporting, disbursement procedures, and the handling of fees and drafts. There is nothing about immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It does not seem to expand executive power, but rather provides rules for how diplomatic officers should handle money. It does not seem to favor state or federal primacy. It does not seem to promote deregulation or intervention. It does not seem to promote conformity or diversity. Therefore, most of the axes should be scored as neutral.",
