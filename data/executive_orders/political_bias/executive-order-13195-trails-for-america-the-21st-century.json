    "critique": "This executive order focuses on establishing and operating America's national system of trails. It emphasizes cooperation between federal agencies, Tribes, States, local governments, and citizen groups to protect, connect, promote, and assist trails. It also stresses the observance of existing laws, including those protecting lands, waters, wildlife habitats, wilderness areas, and cultural values. There is nothing explicitly ideological in the document. It does not touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any significant way. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
