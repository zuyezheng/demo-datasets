    "critique": "This document is a delegation of authority from the President to the Secretary of State regarding certain functions related to supplemental appropriations acts. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The delegation itself could be seen as a slight expansion of executive efficiency, but not necessarily of executive power in a substantive way.",
