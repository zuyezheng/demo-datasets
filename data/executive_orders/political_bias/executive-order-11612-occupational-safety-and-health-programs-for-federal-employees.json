    "critique": "This document establishes occupational safety and health programs within the federal government. It mandates that federal agencies create and maintain safety programs consistent with standards set by the Secretary of Labor. It also establishes a Federal Advisory Council on Occupational Safety and Health to advise the Secretary of Labor. There is nothing particularly liberal or conservative about worker safety. It expands federal power over the states slightly by mandating standards. It does not touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It does involve government intervention in the economy by mandating safety standards.",
