    "critique": "The document is an executive order supplementing a previous order related to the relief, protection, and transportation of American citizens abroad. It establishes a Board of Relief composed of several cabinet members, with the Secretary of the Treasury as Chairman, to oversee the work done under a joint resolution. There is little to assess in terms of political bias, as it is mainly an administrative directive.",
