    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1938 that establishes a migratory bird refuge in Oregon. It transfers land from the Department of Commerce to the Department of Agriculture for this purpose. There is nothing to suggest any ideological tilt. The order does not address immigration. It could be argued that setting aside land for a refuge expands executive power, but it is a very minor expansion. The order involves the federal government managing land, so it leans towards federal control. The order does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It could be argued that environmental conservation involves economic regulation, but this is a stretch. The order does not directly address social inclusion.",
