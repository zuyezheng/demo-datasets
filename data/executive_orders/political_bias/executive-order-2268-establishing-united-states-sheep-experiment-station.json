    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1915 that withdraws land in Idaho for use by the Department of Agriculture as a sheep-breeding and grazing experimental station. It does not directly address any of the axes of political bias. The order is based on existing legislation and acts upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, indicating a standard administrative procedure. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power expansion, federalism concerns, national security implications, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
