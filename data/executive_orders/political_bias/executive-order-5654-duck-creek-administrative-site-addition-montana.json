    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal for the Forest Service. It doesn't directly address any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It is a fairly routine administrative action. The only axis that it touches on is federalism, where it represents a slight increase in federal control over land, but this is within the normal scope of federal land management.",
