    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a labor dispute between railway carriers and their employees. It invokes Section 10 of the Railway Labor Act. There's no indication of a liberal or conservative agenda. It doesn't touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it involves economic regulation by intervening in a labor dispute, but the intervention is temporary and aimed at preventing disruption to interstate commerce. It doesn't significantly expand executive power, as it's a specific action authorized by existing law. It doesn't obviously impact federalism. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
