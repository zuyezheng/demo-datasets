    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the classification of a position within the aviation commission. It seems to grant the aviation commission discretion in appointing a secretary. There is no mention of immigration, civil liberties, or social issues. The order does not seem to obviously favor either states or the federal government. It also does not seem to obviously expand executive power. It also does not seem to obviously favor either economic regulation or deregulation. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt without more context, but it seems relatively neutral. Therefore, the initial scores are all zero.",
