    "critique": "This document pertains to the internal management of the Foreign Service and the granting and payment of allowances. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The executive power axis is slightly expanded as it authorizes the Secretary of State to prescribe regulations.",
