    "critique": "This executive order explicitly bans Chinese people from entering or remaining in the Canal Zone, with limited exceptions. This is a clear case of discriminatory immigration policy based on ethnicity. It also grants significant authority to the Governor of The Panama Canal to make exceptions and enforce the order. The order reflects the historical context of the Chinese Exclusion Act and similar discriminatory practices. It does not touch upon economic regulation, national security vs. civil liberties, or social issues beyond immigration.",
