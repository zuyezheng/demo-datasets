    "critique": "This executive order concerns land use in Alaska, specifically opening up previously withdrawn lands for homesteading, initially prioritizing ex-service men. There's nothing inherently ideological about this. It seems to be a fairly standard administrative action related to land management and veteran affairs. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The federalism aspect is slightly tilted towards federal control as it's a federal order impacting federal lands, but it's not a major shift.",
