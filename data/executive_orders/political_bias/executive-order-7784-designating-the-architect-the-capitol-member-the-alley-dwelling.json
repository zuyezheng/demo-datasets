    "critique": "This executive order pertains to a minor administrative change, specifically the replacement of one member of the Alley Dwelling Authority with another. It does not directly address any of the core political dimensions. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The order does not obviously expand executive power, as it simply modifies an existing order. It also doesn't touch on immigration, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The federalism aspect is slightly relevant, as it deals with a federal authority, but the change is so minor that it doesn't strongly shift the balance.",
