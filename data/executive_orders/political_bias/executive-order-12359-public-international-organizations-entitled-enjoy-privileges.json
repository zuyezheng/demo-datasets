    "critique": "This document designates two international organizations as public international organizations entitled to enjoy certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It does not deal with immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power, but only very slightly, as it is a fairly routine action. It does not seem to have implications for federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
