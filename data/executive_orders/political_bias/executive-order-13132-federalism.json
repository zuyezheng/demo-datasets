    "critique": "This executive order emphasizes federalism, aiming to devolve power to the states and limit federal intervention. It explicitly states adherence to constitutional principles and deference to state policymaking discretion. It also promotes consultation with state and local officials. There is no mention of immigration, security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores on those axes should be neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly conservative due to the emphasis on states' rights and limited federal government.",
