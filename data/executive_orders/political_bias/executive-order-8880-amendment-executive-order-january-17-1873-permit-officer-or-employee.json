    "critique": "This executive order pertains to a very specific situation: allowing Federal employees to hold the office of Chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico. It doesn't touch on broad ideological themes, immigration, executive power in general, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it arguably affects is federalism, as it involves a relationship between the Federal government and a territory (Puerto Rico). However, the effect is minimal. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
