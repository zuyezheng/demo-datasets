    "critique": "The document authorizes the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to order active duty for Operation United Assistance. This leans towards expanding executive power, but it is also for humanitarian assistance. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
