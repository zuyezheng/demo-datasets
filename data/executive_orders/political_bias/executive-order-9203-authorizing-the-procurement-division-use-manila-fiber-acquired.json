    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1942 during World War II regarding the disposition of Manila fiber. Manila fiber was used to make rope, and the order allows the Treasury Department to sell or otherwise dispose of it to the US Navy, the UK, or Canadian manufacturers to promote national defense. Given the context of WWII, several axes are affected. Ideologically, it's a centrist document, as it's a wartime measure. Immigration is not relevant. Executive power is expanded to allow the President to direct the use of resources. Federalism is not particularly affected. National security is prioritized over civil liberties, as it's a wartime measure. Economic regulation is increased, as the government is controlling the distribution of Manila fiber. Social inclusion is not directly addressed.",
