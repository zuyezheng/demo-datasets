    "critique": "This executive order focuses on minimizing civilian casualties in US military operations. It emphasizes compliance with the law of armed conflict, training, intelligence gathering, and precautions during attacks. It also calls for reviewing incidents, acknowledging responsibility, offering condolences, and engaging with international organizations. The order mandates a report on strikes against terrorist targets and periodic consultations. It explicitly states that it doesn't alter the chain of command or create new legal obligations. It seems to promote a balanced approach, trying to minimize harm while maintaining national security interests. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with slight leans towards liberty and inclusion.",
