    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending a previous executive order regarding travel time for members of the uniformed services. It standardizes the calculation of travel time included as active duty and removes a section from the previous order. Given the subject matter, the document has very little ideological content. It primarily concerns administrative details related to military personnel. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
