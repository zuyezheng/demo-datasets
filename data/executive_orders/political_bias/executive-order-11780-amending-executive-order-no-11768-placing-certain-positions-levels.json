    "critique": "This document is an amendment to a previous executive order, placing a position within the Department of Defense at a specific level in the Executive Schedule. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards expanding executive power, but this is only in a very narrow, administrative sense.",
