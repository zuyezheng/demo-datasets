    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between a transportation authority and a union, as per the Railway Labor Act. It seems fairly neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, security vs. liberty, and social inclusion. It does involve the government in economic regulation to some extent by intervening in a labor dispute, but not heavily. It centralizes power in the federal government by establishing a federal board, but this is within the bounds of existing law. It expands executive power slightly by creating the board, but again, this is authorized by law.",
