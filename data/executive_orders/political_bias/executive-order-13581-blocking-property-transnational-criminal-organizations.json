    "critique": "This executive order targets transnational criminal organizations, declaring a national emergency to block their assets and prevent financial support. It broadens executive power by authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to implement the order and block assets, with limited prior notice to affected parties. It also touches on national security concerns. It does not seem to obviously lean left or right. It arguably expands federal power, but only insofar as it concerns international criminal organizations.",
