    "critique": "This executive order establishes a council to advise the President on rural economic development policy. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. It leans slightly towards government intervention in the economy by establishing a council to advise on economic development policy. The order itself doesn't seem to expand executive power significantly, as it mainly establishes an advisory council. It also seems to centralize power at the federal level, as it creates a federal council. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration Approach: 0, Executive Power: 0, Federalism: 2, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0, Economic Regulation: 2, Social Inclusion: 0. After further consideration, the federalism score should be 1, as it's not a strong shift, and the economic regulation score should also be 1, as it's a mild intervention.",
