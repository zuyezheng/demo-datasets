    "critique": "This executive order expands the eligibility for the Purple Heart to include those wounded or killed in international terrorist attacks or while serving in peacekeeping forces. This could be seen as slightly expanding executive power in terms of recognizing such attacks for the purpose of the order. It doesn't directly address immigration, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It leans slightly towards national security by recognizing victims of terrorist attacks.",
