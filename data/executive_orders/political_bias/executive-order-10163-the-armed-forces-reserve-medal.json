    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Armed Forces Reserve Medal. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The order delegates design and regulation to the Secretaries of Defense and Treasury, indicating a balanced approach rather than a strong shift in any direction.",
