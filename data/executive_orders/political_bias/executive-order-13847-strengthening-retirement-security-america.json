    "critique": "This executive order focuses on expanding access to workplace retirement plans, particularly for small businesses and part-time workers. It directs the Secretaries of Labor and Treasury to examine and revise regulations to reduce burdens on employers and improve the effectiveness of retirement plan disclosures. There's a clear emphasis on deregulation and reducing costs for businesses, which aligns with a conservative approach to economic regulation. However, the goal of expanding access to retirement plans can be seen as a social welfare initiative, which is typically associated with liberal policies. The order doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It also doesn't significantly expand executive power, as it primarily directs agencies to review and revise existing regulations. The federalism aspect is neutral, as it doesn't explicitly shift power between the federal government and the states. Therefore, the ideological tilt is slightly conservative due to the deregulation aspect, but also has a liberal element due to the expansion of access to retirement plans. The economic regulation score is negative due to the focus on deregulation. The other scores are mostly neutral.",
