    "critique": "This executive order establishes and amends the criteria for the Medal of Freedom. It broadens the scope of who can receive the medal and under what circumstances. There's a slight tilt towards national security, but overall, it seems fairly balanced and non-ideological. It doesn't directly address immigration, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The expansion of the criteria could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's primarily related to recognition of service.",
