    "critique": "This executive order establishes the order of succession within the Office of Management and Budget. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or social inclusion. It could be argued that by revoking a previous executive order, it is neither expanding nor restricting executive power significantly. Similarly, it doesn't obviously shift the balance of power between the federal government and the states, nor does it directly impact national security or civil liberties. The order has no impact on economic regulation. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
