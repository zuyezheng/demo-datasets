    "critique": "This executive order establishes the order of succession for the Secretary of State. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It could be argued that Section 2 expands executive power, but it also states \"pursuant to law\", which suggests it is not an overreach. It does not directly impact federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion.",
