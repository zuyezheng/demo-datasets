It authorizes the Assistant Secretary to perform the duties of the Secretary when both the Secretary and the First Assistant Secretary are absent or unable to serve. This delegation does not inherently reflect any particular ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion of executive power, shift in federalism, prioritization of national security over civil liberties, economic regulation stance, or social inclusion perspective. It's a routine administrative procedure.",
