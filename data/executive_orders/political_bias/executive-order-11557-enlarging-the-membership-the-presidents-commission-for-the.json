    "critique": "This document is an amendment to an executive order that establishes a commission for the observance of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. It changes the composition of the commission. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral.",
