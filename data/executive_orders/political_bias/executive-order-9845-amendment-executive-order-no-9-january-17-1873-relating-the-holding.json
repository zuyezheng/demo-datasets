    "critique": "This executive order permits Bureau of Reclamation employees to serve as unpaid constables or deputy sheriffs with the Secretary of Interior's approval, provided it doesn't interfere with their duties. This appears to be a minor adjustment for practical reasons. It doesn't strongly indicate a shift in ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It has a slight lean towards state control as it allows federal employees to take on state roles.",
