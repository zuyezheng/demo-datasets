    "critique": "This executive order focuses on preventing and controlling invasive species. It amends a previous order (EO 13112) to strengthen coordinated federal action, expand the National Invasive Species Council's membership, and incorporate considerations of human and environmental health, climate change, and technological innovation. The order emphasizes collaboration across various levels of government and stakeholders. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that would strongly skew the scores. The order seems largely neutral on most axes, with a slight tilt towards environmental protection and inter-agency coordination.",
