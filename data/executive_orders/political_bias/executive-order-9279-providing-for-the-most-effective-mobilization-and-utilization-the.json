    "critique": "This executive order, issued during World War II, consolidates manpower resources under the War Manpower Commission. It centralizes control over the Selective Service System and aims to efficiently allocate labor for the war effort. Ideologically, it reflects a pragmatic approach to national mobilization during wartime, prioritizing collective action and government intervention in the economy and labor market. It doesn't directly address immigration or social inclusion. It expands executive power temporarily for the sake of war, and centralizes federal control. It does not directly address civil liberties, but the nature of the order suggests a prioritization of national security. It involves heavy government intervention in the economy. It does not directly address social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
