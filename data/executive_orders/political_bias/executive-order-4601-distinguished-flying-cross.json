    "critique": "This executive order establishes rules and regulations for awarding the Distinguished Flying Cross. It outlines the process for recommendation, eligibility, and replacement of the medal. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, or prioritization of national security over civil liberties. The order primarily focuses on the administrative aspects of awarding a military honor. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
