    "critique": "This document establishes a board to determine the best location for a government foundry for manufacturing heavy ordnance. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The one exception might be economic regulation, where establishing a government foundry could be seen as a form of government intervention, but it's a very indirect one.",
