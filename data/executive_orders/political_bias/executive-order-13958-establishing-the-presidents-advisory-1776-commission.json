    "critique": "This executive order establishes the '1776 Commission' to promote a particular understanding of American history, emphasizing the nation's founding principles and virtues. It criticizes what it describes as 'radicalized' and 'divisive' accounts of American history that focus on flaws and shortcomings. The order also prioritizes patriotic education and local control over curriculum. It does not address immigration, civil liberties, or economic regulation directly. The order leans conservative in its emphasis on traditional values and a particular interpretation of American history. It also favors decentralization by promoting local control over education. The creation of a presidential commission could be seen as an expansion of executive power, but the order also emphasizes adherence to existing laws and budgetary constraints.",
