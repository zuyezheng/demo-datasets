    "critique": "This executive order focuses on facilitating the participation of Federal employees in international organizations. It directs the Secretary of State to lead the effort and instructs Federal agencies to cooperate by encouraging employee details and transfers. It also delegates certain authorities to the Secretary of State and the Civil Service Commission. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. The order does not directly address immigration. It could be argued that encouraging participation in international organizations slightly expands executive power, but it is a very minor effect. The order does not significantly impact federalism. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It does not directly regulate the economy. It does not directly address social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
