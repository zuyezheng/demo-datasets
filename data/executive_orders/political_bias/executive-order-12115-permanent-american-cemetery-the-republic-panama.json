    "critique": "This executive order concerns the relocation of remains from cemeteries in the Panama Canal Zone, related to the treaties returning the Canal Zone to Panama. It directs the Secretary of State, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the Governor of the Canal Zone, and the Secretary of Defense to take specific actions regarding the disinterment, reinterment, and transportation of remains of U.S. citizens and their families. It also outlines procedures for notifying next of kin and respecting their wishes. There's little ideological content here. Immigration is not directly addressed. Executive power is used to manage the logistics of the treaty implementation. Federalism is implicated in that the federal government is taking responsibility for these cemeteries. There is no clear national security or civil liberties angle. Economic regulation is not a factor. Social inclusion is not a major factor, although there is an effort to respect the wishes of the next of kin.",
