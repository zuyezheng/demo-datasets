    "critique": "This executive order establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between New Jersey Transit Rail and certain of its employees. It is a fairly procedural action, mandated by the Railway Labor Act. There is little indication of strong ideological bias, immigration policy, or social inclusion. It does not dramatically expand executive power, as it is following existing law. It does not obviously favor federal or state control. It has a neutral stance on national security vs. civil liberties. It could be argued that it slightly intervenes in economic regulation by mediating labor disputes, but it's a minimal intervention. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
