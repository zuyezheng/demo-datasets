    "critique": "This document establishes a reservation for the Pueblo Indians. It's difficult to assess its ideological tilt without more context, but given the time period, it could be seen as a paternalistic approach. Immigration is not directly addressed. Executive power is somewhat expanded by creating the reservation. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is creating the reservation. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly addressed. Economic regulation is not directly addressed. Social inclusion is promoted by protecting the land for the Pueblo Indians.",
