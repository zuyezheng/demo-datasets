    "critique": "This document is an executive order withdrawing land in Alaska from settlement for potential use as a national monument. It does not touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on economic regulation as it restricts the use of land. It expands federal power over state control. It is neither particularly liberal nor conservative.",
