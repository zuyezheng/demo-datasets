    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the preparation and format of executive orders and proclamations. It mainly concerns administrative procedures, such as how proclamations should conclude and how they are submitted for publication. There is also a section about affixing the Seal of the United States to certain presidential documents. It does not directly address issues related to ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. However, because it is an executive order, it could be argued that it slightly expands executive power, but this is a very minor effect.",
