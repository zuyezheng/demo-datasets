    "critique": "This document is an executive order from Franklin D. Roosevelt withdrawing land from settlement, location, sale, or entry and reserving it for public use. It does not directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The act of preserving land for public use could be seen as a slight intervention, so the economic regulation score is slightly positive.",
