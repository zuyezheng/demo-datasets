    "critique": "This executive order modifies the composition of the President's Council on Aging. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The change seems administrative in nature, updating the council's membership to include additional cabinet members. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
