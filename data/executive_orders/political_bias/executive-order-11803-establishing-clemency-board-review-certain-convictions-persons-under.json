    "critique": "This executive order establishes a Presidential Clemency Board to review cases of individuals who violated the Military Selective Service Act during the Vietnam War era. It focuses on those who evaded the draft or received undesirable discharges. The order prioritizes those currently confined and without outstanding criminal charges. It does not address immigration directly, but it excludes individuals barred from re-entering the United States. The order creates a board within the executive branch, which could be seen as expanding executive power, although it is for a limited time and specific purpose. It does not directly address federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order seems to lean slightly liberal due to its focus on clemency for those who opposed the Vietnam War. It also balances national security with civil liberties by offering a path for those who violated the draft to reintegrate into society.",
