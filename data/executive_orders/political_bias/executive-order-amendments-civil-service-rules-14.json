It is a very specific and narrow change, relettering a paragraph and making minor adjustments to job titles within the postal service. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power changes, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
