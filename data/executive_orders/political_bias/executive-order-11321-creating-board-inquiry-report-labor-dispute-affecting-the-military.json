    "critique": "The document is an executive order creating a Board of Inquiry to investigate a labor dispute. It invokes the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or social inclusion. It does not obviously expand executive power, as it is based on existing legislation. It doesn't directly address federalism. It leans towards national security by addressing a strike that could affect the military aircraft engine industry. It could be seen as interventionist in the economy by addressing a labor dispute.",
