    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1936 exempting an employee from mandatory retirement. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of such a document. It does not relate to immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It arguably expands executive power slightly by using an exemption, but this is a very minor expansion within existing law.",
