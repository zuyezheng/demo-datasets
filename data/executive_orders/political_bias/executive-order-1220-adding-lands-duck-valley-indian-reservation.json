    "critique": "The document establishes an addition to the Duck Valley Indian Reservation withdrawing land from settlement, entry, and sale. This likely favors social inclusion and indigenous rights. The order doesn't explicitly address economic regulation, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, or immigration, so those are likely neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the support for indigenous populations.",
