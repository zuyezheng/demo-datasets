    "critique": "This document pertains to the National Industrial Recovery Act, which was a New Deal program. This suggests a liberal ideological tilt due to government intervention in the economy. The document doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. However, the approval of a code of fair competition implies some level of economic regulation. Therefore, the initial scores reflect these considerations.",
