    "critique": "This executive order expands the scope of the Secretary of Agriculture's powers under the National Industrial Recovery Act to include a wider range of agricultural commodities and related industries. It also establishes a mechanism for resolving disputes regarding the order's applicability, ultimately giving the President the final say. This indicates a moderate expansion of executive power and a move towards federal control over agriculture-related industries. There is a moderate level of economic intervention. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, impact on national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion.",
