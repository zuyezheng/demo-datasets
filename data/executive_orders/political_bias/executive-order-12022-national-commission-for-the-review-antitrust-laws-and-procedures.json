It aims to expedite the resolution of complex antitrust cases and consider the desirability of retaining exemptions from antitrust laws. There is no discussion of immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or social inclusion. The document seems to favor deregulation by reviewing exemptions and simplifying standards for monopolization.",
