    "critique": "The document is an executive order from President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordering National Guard units into active military service. It reflects a strong assertion of executive power during a time of national emergency (pre-WWII). There is a focus on national security and the efficient mobilization of troops. The order centralizes control of the National Guard under the federal government. There is no direct impact on economic regulation, immigration, or social inclusion.",
