    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1933 that modifies the boundaries of two military reservations, Fort Randolph and France Field, in the Canal Zone. It reassigns land between the two reservations. The document itself is purely administrative and technical, focusing on geographical coordinates and legal descriptions. There is no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order does not expand executive power, as it simply adjusts existing reservations. It also doesn't obviously shift power between the federal government and the state, given that the Canal Zone was under federal control. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
