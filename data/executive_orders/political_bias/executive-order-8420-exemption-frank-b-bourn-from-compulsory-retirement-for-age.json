    "critique": "This document is an executive order that extends the exemption of Frank B. Bours from compulsory retirement for age. It does not seem to have any implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it touches on is executive power, as it is an executive order. However, it is a very specific and limited action, so it does not represent a significant expansion of executive power.",
