    "critique": "This document is a delegation of authority from the President to the Secretary of State regarding the Hostage Relief Act of 1980. It does not express a clear ideological tilt, immigration approach, or stance on social inclusion. It does not directly address national security vs. civil liberties or economic regulation. The primary focus is on delegating executive power and does not significantly impact federalism. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards expanding executive power due to the delegation itself.",
