    "critique": "This document establishes the Pacific Northwest River Basins Commission. It appears to be a fairly standard executive order, based on existing legislation (Water Resources Planning Act). There's nothing inherently liberal or conservative about it. It involves multiple states, so it's not heavily federalist, but it does create a federal commission, so it's not heavily state-controlled either. It doesn't touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It does involve economic regulation in the sense that water resources are managed, but it's not a strong intervention. It seems mostly neutral across the board.",
