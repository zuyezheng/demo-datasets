    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Willapa Harbor Migratory Bird Refuge. It transfers land to the Department of Agriculture for the purpose of protecting migratory birds and other wildlife. It also revokes a previous executive order related to lighthouse purposes. There is a provision to allow the Departments of War and Treasury to use rights-of-way for roads, telephone lines, and transmission lines. The document itself does not express an opinion on immigration, and does not seem to expand executive power beyond what is necessary to establish the refuge. It does not seem to strongly favor either state or federal control, and does not directly address national security vs. civil liberties. It also does not seem to directly address economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral.",
