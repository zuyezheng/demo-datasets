    "critique": "This document is a modification to a previous executive order regarding land use and a railroad right of way. It seems to be a fairly specific and technical decision. It is difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt. It does not seem to directly relate to immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The federalism aspect is slightly relevant as it involves federal land and a decision made at the federal level, but it's not a major shift in power. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
