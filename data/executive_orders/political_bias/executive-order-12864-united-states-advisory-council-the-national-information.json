    "critique": "This document establishes an advisory council on the National Information Infrastructure. It is signed by the President and refers to the Commerce Department and the Secretary of Commerce. It compels executive agencies to provide information to the council. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt. There is no mention of immigration. The establishment of a council does not necessarily expand executive power. The council is federal, so it leans towards federal primacy. There is no mention of national security or civil liberties. The council relates to the National Information Infrastructure, so it could be seen as a form of economic intervention. There is no mention of social inclusion.",
