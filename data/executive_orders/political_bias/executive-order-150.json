    "critique": "The document discusses an amendment to the rules and regulations regarding the Army and Navy General Hospital at Hot Springs, AR. It specifies that enlisted men of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps on the retired list, as well as honorably discharged soldiers and sailors of the Regular and Volunteer Army and Navy, will pay 40 cents per day for sustenance. This appears to be a matter of economic policy related to veterans' care.",
