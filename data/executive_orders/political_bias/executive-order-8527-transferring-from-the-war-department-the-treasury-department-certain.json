    "critique": "This document is a transfer of land from the War Department to the Treasury Department for Coast Guard purposes. It does not seem to have any ideological tilt. It does not deal with immigration. It does not expand executive power, but merely executes existing law. It has no implications for federalism. It does not touch on national security vs. civil liberties. It does not deal with economic regulation. It does not address social inclusion.",
