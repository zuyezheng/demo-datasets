    "critique": "This executive order delegates the function of adopting, altering, and using an official seal or emblem of the Peace Corps to the Director of the Peace Corps. It also removes a section from a previous executive order. This seems to be an administrative change with little to no impact on the axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
