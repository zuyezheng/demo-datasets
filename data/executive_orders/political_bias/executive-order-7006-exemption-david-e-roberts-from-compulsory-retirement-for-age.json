    "critique": "This is an executive order that extends the employment of a government employee beyond the standard retirement age. It does not touch on ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It grants an exception based on the president's judgment of public interest, which can be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's a very specific and limited case. It doesn't significantly affect federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight nudge towards executive power expansion.",
