    "critique": "This document centralizes power within the executive branch by standardizing and streamlining vetting processes for federal employees and contractors. It emphasizes national security and efficiency, potentially at the expense of individual rights and agency autonomy. The focus on consistent standards and reciprocal recognition of security clearances suggests a move towards federal control and away from state or agency-specific discretion.",
