There is no direct indication of ideological tilt. It does not directly address immigration. It expands executive power by creating a commission. It is federalist in that it seeks to coordinate local, state, and federal authorities. It balances national security and civil liberties by seeking to understand the causes of the riots. It does not directly address economic regulation. It promotes social inclusion by seeking to understand the causes of the riots.",
