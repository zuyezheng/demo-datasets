    "critique": "This executive order establishes campaign medals for service members during World War II. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The order does delegate authority to the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy to prescribe regulations, but this is a standard administrative procedure and doesn't significantly expand executive power.",
