    "critique": "This document is an executive order that modifies the composition of the President's Council on Youth Fitness. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The change in the council's composition doesn't inherently expand or restrict executive power; it's a minor administrative adjustment.",
