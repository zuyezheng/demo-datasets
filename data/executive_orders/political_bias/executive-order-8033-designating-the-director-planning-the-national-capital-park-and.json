    "critique": "This document pertains to an administrative change regarding the Alley Dwelling Authority in Washington D.C. during the 1930s. It shifts the role of a member within the authority. There is no direct indication of ideological leaning, immigration policy, or civil liberties impact. The focus is strictly on internal administrative structure. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism aspect is slightly positive as it deals with D.C., which is under federal jurisdiction.",
