    "critique": "This executive order sets aside land for the Makah and other Indians in Washington Territory. This action suggests a recognition of indigenous rights and a willingness to allocate resources to them. However, it's also important to consider the historical context, where such actions were often accompanied by displacement and assimilation policies. The order itself doesn't explicitly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion beyond the specific context of the Makah tribe. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral, with a slight positive score for social inclusion due to the recognition of indigenous rights.",
