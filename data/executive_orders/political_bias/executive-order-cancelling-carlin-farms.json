    "critique": "This executive order cancels a previous order that set aside land as a reservation for the Northwestern Shoshone Indians. This action reduces the land available to the tribe and favors westward expansion and resource exploitation by non-native settlers. This suggests a conservative ideological tilt, a restrictive approach to social inclusion for indigenous populations, and a favoring of economic deregulation by opening up land for private use. It also centralizes power by reversing a prior designation.",
