    "critique": "This executive order establishes a board to promote the employment of people with disabilities. It seems to promote social inclusion and may involve some government intervention in the economy to support employment opportunities. It doesn't seem to touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, or national security vs. civil liberties. It is moderately liberal in its approach to social inclusion and economic regulation.",
