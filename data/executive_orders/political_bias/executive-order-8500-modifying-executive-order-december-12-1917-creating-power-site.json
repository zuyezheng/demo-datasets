    "critique": "This document pertains to the modification of an existing power site reserve to allow for the construction of a highway by Lane County, Oregon. It seems to be a fairly specific administrative decision. There's no clear indication of a liberal or conservative ideological tilt. The document doesn't directly address immigration. It could be argued that allowing the state to build a highway shows some deference to state control, but it's a very minor point. The document doesn't seem to touch on national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The executive is acting within existing law, so it is hard to say if this expands executive power. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
