    "critique": "This document concerns the opening of public lands in Wyoming for homesteading and desert land laws, initially to ex-service men and then to the general public. It revokes a previous executive order that withdrew these lands pending resurveys. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, or national security. It has a slight impact on federalism by opening up federal lands, and a minor impact on economic regulation by enabling homesteading. There's no clear indication of social inclusion or exclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with slight adjustments for federalism and economic regulation.",
