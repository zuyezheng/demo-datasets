    "critique": "This document is a transfer of land from the US government to the people of Puerto Rico. It is an executive order from President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It appears to be a fairly routine administrative action, transferring land that is no longer needed by the US government to the people of Puerto Rico. There is no obvious ideological tilt, immigration component, or impact on civil liberties. It could be argued that it slightly increases federal power by the President making this decision, but it is within existing statutory authority. It also could be argued that it promotes social inclusion by benefiting the people of Puerto Rico.",
