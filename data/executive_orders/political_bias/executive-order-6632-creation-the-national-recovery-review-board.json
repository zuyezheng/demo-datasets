    "critique": "This document establishes the National Recovery Review Board to ensure fair competition and prevent monopolies under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It aims to protect small businesses and rectify any discriminatory practices within approved codes. The order grants the board significant authority to investigate and recommend changes to existing codes, reflecting a strong government intervention in the economy. The board members are appointed by the president, and the board has the power to appoint its own personnel without regard to civil service laws, indicating an expansion of executive power. The focus on preventing monopolies and protecting small businesses aligns with a liberal approach to economic regulation. There is no direct impact on immigration, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes should be neutral.",
