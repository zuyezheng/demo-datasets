It cites the act of June 25, 1910, as amended by the act of August 24, 1912, and the act of March 3, 1909. There is nothing to suggest ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power implications, federalism concerns, national security implications, economic regulation implications or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, all scores should be 0.",
