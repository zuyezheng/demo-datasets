Ideological Tilt: The document does not express a clear ideological stance. It focuses on the process of pension applications, not on broader political or social issues. Score: 0\n2.  Immigration Approach: The document does not address immigration. Score: 0\n3.  Executive Power: The document specifies that pension payments will commence after the Secretary's decision, suggesting some level of executive authority in the process. Score: 1\n4.
