    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Federal Safety Council to advise the Secretary of Labor on matters relating to the safety of civilian employees of the Federal government and the municipal government of the District of Columbia. It encourages safe practices, eliminates work hazards and health risks, and reduces compensable injuries. There is nothing particularly liberal or conservative about worker safety. It does not address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
