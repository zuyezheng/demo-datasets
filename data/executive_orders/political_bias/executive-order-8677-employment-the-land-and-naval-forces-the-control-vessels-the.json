    "critique": "The document expands executive power and prioritizes security due to a declared national emergency. The order allows the Secretary of Treasury and the Governor of the Panama Canal to request assistance from the land and naval forces for vessel control. This leans towards federal control and potentially limits individual liberties in the name of national security.",
