    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the transfer of property to the state of Alaska. It does not touch upon social issues, immigration, or national security. It seems to favor state control over federal, but only in the specific case of transferring property in Alaska. It does not seem to expand executive power, but rather clarifies existing authority. There is no indication of economic regulation or deregulation. It does not address social inclusion or conformity.",
