    "critique": "This executive order concerns the transfer of functions related to providing relief assistance to countries devastated by war from the Secretary of State to the Administrator for Economic Cooperation. It also involves the transfer of personnel, records, property, and funds. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion/restriction, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
