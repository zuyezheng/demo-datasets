    "critique": "This executive order focuses on promoting competition across various sectors of the American economy. It aims to address issues like market concentration, anti-competitive practices, and consolidation in industries such as healthcare, agriculture, technology, and telecommunications. The order encourages various federal agencies to enforce antitrust laws, promote market transparency, and consider new regulations to foster competition. It also establishes a White House Competition Council to coordinate these efforts. The order does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It primarily focuses on economic regulation and market competition. Therefore, the scores for immigration, security/liberty, and social inclusion should be neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal, as it favors government intervention to regulate markets and protect consumers and workers. The executive power is slightly expanded through the creation of the White House Competition Council and the encouragement of agency rulemaking. The federalism aspect is neutral, as the order does not significantly shift power between the federal government and the states. The economic regulation score is positive, as the order promotes government intervention to address market concentration and anti-competitive practices.",
