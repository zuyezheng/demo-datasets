    "critique": "This document authorizes an increase in the enlisted strength of the Regular Army. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document could be seen as slightly leaning towards national security, but it's primarily an administrative action.",
