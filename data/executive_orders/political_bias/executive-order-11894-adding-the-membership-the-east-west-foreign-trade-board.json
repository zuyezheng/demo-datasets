    "critique": "This document is an executive order that amends a previous executive order to add the Secretary of Defense to the East-West Foreign Trade Board. This board seems to deal with international economic policy. The addition of the Secretary of Defense doesn't inherently shift the ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It's primarily an administrative change.",
