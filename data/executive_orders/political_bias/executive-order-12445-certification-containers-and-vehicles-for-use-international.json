    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the transfer of authority regarding international customs conventions related to the transport of goods. It delegates authority from the Secretary of Transportation to the Secretary of the Treasury. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It seems to have a slight impact on federalism, shifting power slightly towards the federal government by centralizing authority in the Treasury. It also has a slight impact on economic regulation, allowing the Secretary to prescribe fees. There is no discernible impact on social inclusion.",
