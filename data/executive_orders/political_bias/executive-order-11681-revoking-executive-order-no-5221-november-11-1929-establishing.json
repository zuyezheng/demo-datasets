    "critique": "This document simply revokes a previous executive order limiting the non-official employment of government officers or employees. Without knowing the specifics of the original order, it's difficult to assess the precise impact on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. However, we can make some educated guesses. The revocation could be seen as slightly expanding economic freedom for government employees, thus leaning slightly towards deregulation. It's unlikely to have a significant impact on other axes.",
