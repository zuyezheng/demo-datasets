    "critique": "This is an executive order that makes an exception to a rule about mandatory retirement age for government employees. It allows one person to continue working past the normal retirement age. There is nothing particularly liberal or conservative about this. It does give the executive branch more power, but only very slightly. It doesn't really touch on immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral.",
