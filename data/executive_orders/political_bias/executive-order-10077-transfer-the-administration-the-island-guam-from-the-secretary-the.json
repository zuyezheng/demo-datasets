    "critique": "This executive order transfers administrative control of Guam from the Department of the Navy to the Department of the Interior. This seems like a fairly neutral administrative action with little direct impact on the axes of political bias. There's no clear ideological tilt, immigration policy change, expansion of executive power, or shift in federalism. It doesn't directly address national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
