    "critique": "This document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order, extending the deadline for the Commission on United States-Pacific Trade and Investment Policy. It does not contain any information related to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, all those axes should be scored as neutral. The ideological tilt is also neutral, as trade policy can be supported by both liberals and conservatives.",
