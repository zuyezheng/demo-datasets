    "critique": "The document extends civil service rules to the Isthmian Canal Commission, increasing federal oversight and potentially limiting executive appointments. This suggests a moderate increase in federal control and a slight restraint on executive power. The document does not directly address social issues, immigration, or economic regulation, so these scores are neutral. The emphasis on standardized examinations suggests a move towards conformity in hiring practices.",
