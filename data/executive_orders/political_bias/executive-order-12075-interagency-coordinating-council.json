    "critique": "This executive order establishes an interagency coordinating council to improve cooperation and coordination of urban and regional policy implementation among and between Executive agencies. It aims to involve all sectors of the Nation, including State, county and local governments, regional bodies, the private sector, neighborhood groups, and volunteer and civic associations, in a partnership to conserve and strengthen America's communities. It does not seem to obviously lean one way or the other ideologically. It seems to expand federal power by creating a council to coordinate policy. It doesn't touch on immigration, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, those will be neutral. The order seems to centralize power at the federal level.",
