    "critique": "This executive order establishes the order of succession for the Secretary of Defense. It appears to be a routine administrative procedure. There is no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or any impact on civil liberties. It does not expand executive power significantly, as it simply clarifies the line of succession. It does not directly affect federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores should be neutral across all axes.",
