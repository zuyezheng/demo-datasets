    "critique": "This document is an executive order that opens tax returns for inspection by a House Select Committee. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt without more context, but the fact that it enables oversight suggests a slight lean towards accountability. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral. The opening of tax records could be seen as a minor check on power, but it is primarily for oversight purposes.",
