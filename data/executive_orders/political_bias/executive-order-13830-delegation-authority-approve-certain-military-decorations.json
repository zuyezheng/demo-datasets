It does not directly address issues related to the traditional left-right political spectrum, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document primarily focuses on recognizing and rewarding military service and heroism.",
