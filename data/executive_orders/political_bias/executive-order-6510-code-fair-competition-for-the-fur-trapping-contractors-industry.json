    "critique": "This document pertains to the National Industrial Recovery Act, which was a New Deal program. This suggests a liberal ideological tilt due to government intervention in the economy. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The document explicitly approves a 'Code of Fair Competition,' indicating government involvement in regulating the 'Fur Trapping Contractors Industry,' thus heavy intervention. Therefore, economic regulation should be high. The document doesn't seem to touch upon social issues, so social inclusion should be neutral.",
