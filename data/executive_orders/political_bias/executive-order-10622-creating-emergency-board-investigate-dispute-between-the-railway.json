    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between a railway company and its employees. It seems to be a fairly neutral action, intervening in a labor dispute to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. It doesn't obviously lean left or right, nor does it touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It does involve government intervention in the economy, but in a limited way to resolve a specific dispute. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by creating the board, but it's within the bounds of existing law.",
