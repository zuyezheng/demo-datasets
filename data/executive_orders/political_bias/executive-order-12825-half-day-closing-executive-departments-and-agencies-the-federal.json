    "critique": "This executive order is a straightforward directive to close federal offices for half a day on Christmas Eve. It includes exceptions for national security and essential services. There's nothing inherently ideological about this. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
