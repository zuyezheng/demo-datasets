    "critique": "This executive order establishes a board to investigate a dispute between the Long Island Railroad and its employees. It is based on the Railway Labor Act and aims to resolve the dispute through a neutral board. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or social inclusion. The order does not significantly expand executive power, as it is based on existing legislation. It also does not directly impact federalism or national security vs. civil liberties. The economic regulation aspect is neutral, as it simply aims to resolve a labor dispute. Therefore, most scores should be around 0.",
