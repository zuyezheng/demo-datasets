    "critique": "This is an executive order that extends the employment of a government employee beyond the standard retirement age. It does not seem to have strong implications for any of the axes. The ideological tilt is neutral as it doesn't promote any particular political ideology. The immigration approach is irrelevant. The executive power is slightly expanded as it uses the president's authority to make an exception to a rule, but it is a minor expansion. The federalism aspect is neutral. The national security vs. civil liberties aspect is neutral. The economic regulation aspect is neutral. The social inclusion aspect is neutral.",
