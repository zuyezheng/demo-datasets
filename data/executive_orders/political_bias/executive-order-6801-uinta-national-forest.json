    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that expands the Uinta National Forest in Utah. It does not touch upon social issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It does expand federal control over land, which could be seen as an expansion of executive power and federalism. The order also restricts the purchase of privately owned lands within the area until provision is made for the purchase of such lands from the entire receipts from the Uinta National Forest, which could be seen as a form of economic regulation.",
