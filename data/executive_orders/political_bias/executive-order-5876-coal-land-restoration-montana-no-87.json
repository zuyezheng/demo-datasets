    "critique": "This document revokes previous executive orders related to coal land withdrawals in Montana. It's primarily a land management action. There's no clear ideological tilt, immigration impact, or effect on civil liberties. It could be argued that revoking the withdrawals promotes deregulation by opening up land for potential coal extraction, but the effect is minimal. It doesn't significantly alter the balance of power between the federal government and the states, nor does it directly address social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards deregulation.",
