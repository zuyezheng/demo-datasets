    "critique": "This document is an amendment to Schedule A, Subdivision III, paragraph 13, of excepted positions under the Treasury Department. It adds employees engaged at psittacosis investigation stations to the list of excepted positions, which already includes those working with leprosy, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and yellow fever. This seems to be an administrative update to include a newly relevant disease. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power changes, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
