    "critique": "This executive order focuses on improving the nation's resilience to wildfire by directing federal agencies to enhance the resilience of federal buildings in areas at risk of wildfire. It mandates compliance with the International Wildland-Urban Interface Code (IWUIC) for new and altered federal buildings and encourages compliance for existing buildings. The order aims to protect public safety, economic strength, and national security by reducing the risk of structure loss due to wildfire. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It could be seen as expanding federal power slightly by mandating certain building codes, but it also allows for flexibility and encourages agencies to act within existing legal frameworks. It doesn't directly regulate the economy or promote social inclusion/diversity. Therefore, the scores should reflect this focus on wildfire resilience and minimal impact on other areas.",
