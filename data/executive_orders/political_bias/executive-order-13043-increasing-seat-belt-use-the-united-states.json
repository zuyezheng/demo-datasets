    "critique": "This executive order mandates seat belt use for federal employees and encourages it in other contexts like national parks, defense installations, and among federal contractors. It also encourages tribal governments to adopt similar policies. There's a slight tilt towards government intervention for safety (economic regulation) and potentially a minor expansion of federal authority, but overall it seems fairly moderate. It doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is hard to gauge, as safety measures can be supported across the spectrum, but it leans slightly liberal due to the interventionist nature.",
