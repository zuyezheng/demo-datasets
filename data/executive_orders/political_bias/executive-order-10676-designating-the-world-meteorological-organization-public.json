This action doesn't directly align with any specific ideological stance but rather focuses on international cooperation and legal recognition. There's no explicit mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are set to neutral across all axes.",
