    "critique": "This executive order establishes an interagency Ocean Policy Committee to coordinate ocean-related matters. It aims to promote economic growth, energy security, and environmental benefits related to oceans, coasts, and the Great Lakes. It emphasizes interagency coordination and collaboration with stakeholders. There is nothing explicitly liberal or conservative about this. It does not address immigration. It could be seen as expanding executive power slightly by creating a new committee, but it also emphasizes interagency coordination, which could be seen as a check on executive power. It could be seen as shifting power to the federal government by creating a federal committee to coordinate ocean policy. It does not directly address national security vs. civil liberties. It could be seen as interventionist by promoting economic growth and environmental benefits, but it also emphasizes sustainable use of ocean resources. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
