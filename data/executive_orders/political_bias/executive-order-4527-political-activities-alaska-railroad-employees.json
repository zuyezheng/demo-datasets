    "critique": "This document is an executive order that allows employees of The Alaska Railroad to run for municipal office in the towns where they live, as long as it doesn't interfere with their railroad duties. This seems like a fairly neutral decision with minimal political implications. It doesn't strongly lean liberal or conservative, doesn't deal with immigration, has no impact on executive power or federalism, and doesn't touch on national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
