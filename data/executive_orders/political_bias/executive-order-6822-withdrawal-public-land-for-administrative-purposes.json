    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order for use by the Department of Agriculture in connection with the administration of the Mono National Forest. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The federal government is exercising control over land within a state, so federalism is slightly positive.",
