    "critique": "This is a military order. It is difficult to assess its political bias without more context. It seems neutral on most axes. It does not obviously expand executive power, as it simply directs a general to report to an admiral. It doesn't touch on economic regulation, social inclusion, or immigration. It is hard to say whether it favors national security or civil liberties. It does not obviously favor federal or state control.",
