    "critique": "The document discusses the Treaty of October 2, 1863, and its application to territory ceded to the United States. It orders that Article 7 of the treaty shall not apply to a portion of the ceded territory, except for the area east of the 6th Guide Meridian. The order remains in effect until directed otherwise by Congress or the President. This suggests a shift in the application of the treaty's provisions within the specified territory.",
