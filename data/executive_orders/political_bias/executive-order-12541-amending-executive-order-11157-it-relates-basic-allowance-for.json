    "critique": "This executive order defines \"sea duty\" for the purpose of determining eligibility for certain benefits under Title 37 of the United States Code. It specifies that duty for less than three months is not considered sea duty, and duty for more than three months under temporary orders which provide for return to the member's same permanent station is also not considered sea duty. It also strikes out subsection (f) of Section 401, Part IV, of Executive Order No. 11157. This order seems to have very little to do with any of the axes. It is a technical correction to a definition. Therefore, all scores should be 0.",
