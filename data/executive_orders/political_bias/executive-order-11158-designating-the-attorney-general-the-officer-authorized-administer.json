    "critique": "This document is a delegation of authority to the Attorney General to administer an agreement with Austria regarding the return of Austrian property. It is a fairly technical and administrative action. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It does not directly address immigration. It delegates authority, but within the scope of an existing agreement, so it's not a major expansion of executive power. It doesn't significantly impact federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
