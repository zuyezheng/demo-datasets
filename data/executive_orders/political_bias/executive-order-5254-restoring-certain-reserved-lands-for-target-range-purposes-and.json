    "critique": "This executive order concerns land allocation for veterans of World War I. It revokes a previous order that reserved land for the New Mexico National Guard and opens it up for homesteading by veterans, with a period of preference for them before opening it to the general public. This has implications for federalism and economic regulation, but minimal impact on other axes.",
