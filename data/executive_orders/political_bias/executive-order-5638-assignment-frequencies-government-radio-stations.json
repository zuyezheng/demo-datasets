    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1931 regarding the allocation of radio frequencies to government stations. It outlines principles for frequency allocation, encouraging utilization of existing communication facilities and government encouragement to private radio enterprises. It also allows for temporary use of other frequencies for testing purposes. The document does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It touches on economic regulation by allocating frequencies and encouraging private radio, but it doesn't heavily intervene in the economy. It expands executive power by allocating frequencies and setting rules for government radio stations. It also touches on federalism by discussing the relationship between government departments and the Federal Radio Commission. The document's ideological tilt is difficult to assess, as it primarily deals with technical matters.",
