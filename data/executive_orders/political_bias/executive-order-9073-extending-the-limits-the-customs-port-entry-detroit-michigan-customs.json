    "critique": "This document pertains to the extension of the customs port of entry of Detroit, Michigan, to include several municipalities and townships. It is a very specific administrative action, and it is difficult to map it onto the provided axes. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power dynamics, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation implications, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, a neutral score is appropriate for each axis.",
