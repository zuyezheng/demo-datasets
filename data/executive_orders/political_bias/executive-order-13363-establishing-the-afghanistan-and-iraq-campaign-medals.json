    "critique": "This executive order establishes campaign medals for service in Afghanistan and Iraq. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It delegates authority to the Secretaries of the military departments and the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations for awarding the medals. The order itself doesn't expand executive power significantly, as it's within the President's authority to recognize military service. It also doesn't directly impact federalism or social inclusion. The order has a slight national security focus due to its military nature, but it also provides recognition for service members, which can be seen as supporting individual contributions.",
