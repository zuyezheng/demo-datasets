    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a labor dispute between the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation and its employees. It is a fairly procedural action mandated by the Railway Labor Act. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It could be argued that establishing the board expands executive power, but this is a mandated action. It has a slight impact on economic regulation by intervening in a labor dispute, and no impact on federalism or social inclusion.",
