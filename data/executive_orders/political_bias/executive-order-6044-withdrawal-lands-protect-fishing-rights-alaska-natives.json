    "critique": "This executive order withdraws and reserves a portion of Amaknak Island, Alaska, to protect the fishing rights of Alaska natives. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It is difficult to assess its impact on immigration. It does not expand executive power, as it is based on existing legislation. It could be seen as slightly increasing federal control, but the primary purpose is to protect native rights. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It does not directly regulate the economy. It promotes social inclusion by protecting the rights of Alaska natives.",
