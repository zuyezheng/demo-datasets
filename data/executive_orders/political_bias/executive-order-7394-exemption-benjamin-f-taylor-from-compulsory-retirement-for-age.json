    "critique": "This is an executive order that makes an exception to a rule about mandatory retirement for a specific government employee. It does not seem to have any significant implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it touches on is executive power, as it uses the power of the executive branch to make an exception to a rule. However, the original law already allowed for such exceptions, so this order does not expand executive power in a significant way.",
