    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Environmental Quality Council and the Citizens' Advisory Committee on Environmental Quality. It aims to advise and assist the President on environmental quality matters, foster cooperation between different levels of government and private organizations, and promote scientific knowledge and public participation in environmental protection. It also emphasizes the assessment of new technologies for their environmental effects and coordination among federal agencies. The order does not directly address immigration, national security, or civil liberties. It leans towards government intervention in environmental matters and promotes social inclusion by encouraging public participation and environmental protection. It could be seen as expanding executive power by creating new councils and committees to advise the President.",
