    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a labor dispute between railway carriers and their employees. It aims to prevent interruption of interstate commerce. There's no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by creating the board, but it's a fairly standard action. It doesn't seem to significantly affect federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
