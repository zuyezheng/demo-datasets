    "critique": "The document describes an act of Congress to provide relief to starving people in Russia. It establishes a commission to purchase, transport, and deliver food. It authorizes the United States Grain Corporation to act as the fiscal agency and the American Relief Administration to distribute the commodities in Russia. The act does not explicitly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are set to neutral for all axes.",
