    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to purchase and distribute food to starving people in Russia. \n\n1.  Ideological Tilt: This is a humanitarian effort. It is difficult to place on the left-right spectrum. I will score it as neutral.\n2.  Immigration Approach: This does not relate to immigration. I will score it as neutral.\n3.

I will score it as neutral.\n5.  National Security vs. Civil Liberties: This does not relate to national security or civil liberties. I will score it as neutral.\n6.  Economic Regulation: This involves government purchasing and distribution of goods, indicating some intervention in the economy. I will score it as moderate intervention.\n7.
