    "critique": "This document establishes a wildlife refuge in North Dakota. It restricts hunting and disturbing wildlife within the refuge. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The act of setting aside land for conservation could be seen as a slight intervention, but it's primarily environmental.",
