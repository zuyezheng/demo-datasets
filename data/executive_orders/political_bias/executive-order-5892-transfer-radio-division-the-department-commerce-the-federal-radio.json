    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1932 that transfers the duties, powers, and functions of the Radio Division of the Department of Commerce to the Federal Radio Commission. It is a relatively straightforward administrative action authorized by an act of Congress. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. The order itself doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, or federalism in a significant way. It does involve economic regulation of the radio industry, but the order itself is simply a transfer of power, not a change in the level of regulation. It doesn't directly impact national security vs. civil liberties or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The transfer of duties could be seen as a slight increase in federal control, but it's not a major shift.",
