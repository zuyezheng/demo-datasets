    "critique": "The document is an approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Gas Cock Industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. This act is a clear example of government intervention in the economy. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is moderately liberal due to the interventionist nature of the act.",
