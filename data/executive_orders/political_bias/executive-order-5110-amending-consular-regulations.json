    "critique": "This document primarily concerns consular regulations and fees. However, it explicitly references and reinforces the Chinese Exclusion Laws, indicating a restrictive stance on immigration based on race. The document itself doesn't expand executive power significantly, but it does implement regulations under existing statutes. The changes to record-keeping seem neutral. The document reflects the social norms of its time, which were not inclusive.",
