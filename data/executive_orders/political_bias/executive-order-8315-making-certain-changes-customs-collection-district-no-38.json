    "critique": "This document is a simple administrative order regarding customs collection districts in Michigan. It revokes the designation of Grand Haven as a customs port of entry and designates Muskegon as a customs port of entry. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
