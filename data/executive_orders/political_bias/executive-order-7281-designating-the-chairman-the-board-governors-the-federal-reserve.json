    "critique": "The document is a simple appointment of a chairman to the Federal Reserve. It doesn't touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on economic regulation, as the chairman can influence monetary policy, but it's indirect. It also doesn't significantly alter the balance of power between the federal government and the states, nor does it dramatically expand executive power. The ideological tilt is hard to gauge without knowing the specific views of the appointee, but I will assume a moderate stance.",
