    "critique": "This document is a land reservation for a dock site to be used by the Forest Service and other government bureaus. It's a fairly mundane administrative action. There's no clear ideological tilt, immigration component, or impact on civil liberties. It could be argued that reserving land for federal use slightly expands federal power at the expense of state control, and involves government intervention in the economy by allocating resources. There's no obvious connection to social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
