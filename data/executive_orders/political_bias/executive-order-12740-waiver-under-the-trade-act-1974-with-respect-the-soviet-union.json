    "critique": "This document is a waiver of subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to the Soviet Union. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt without more context, but given the time period (1990) and the subject matter (trade with the Soviet Union), it likely reflects a pragmatic approach to international relations during the end of the Cold War. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is somewhat expanded as the president is enacting a waiver. Federalism is not directly implicated. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly implicated. Economic regulation is likely decreased as trade restrictions are waived. Social inclusion is not directly implicated.",
