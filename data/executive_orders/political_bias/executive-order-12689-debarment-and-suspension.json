    "critique": "The document centralizes authority within the federal government by ensuring that debarment or suspension from procurement or non-procurement activities by one agency has a government-wide effect. This reduces state autonomy and standardizes regulations across the board. It also touches on economic regulation by controlling who the Federal Government can engage with, ensuring responsible persons and integrity in Federal activities.",
