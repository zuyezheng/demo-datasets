    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1933 regarding veteran disability pensions. It adjusts the rates of compensation payable for service-connected disabilities, particularly for veterans who served before November 11, 1918. It does not touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It does not seem to expand executive power beyond what was already authorized by Congress. It centralizes control over veteran benefits at the federal level. It involves government intervention in the economy by setting rates of compensation. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
