    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between the Long Island Rail Road and certain labor organizations. It is a fairly neutral document that follows the Railway Labor Act. There is little to suggest any strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, federalism concerns, national security implications, or social inclusion issues. The only area where it has some impact is economic regulation, where it leans slightly towards intervention by establishing a board to resolve a labor dispute.",
