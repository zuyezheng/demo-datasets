    "critique": "This document is a transfer of land from the federal government to the Territory of Hawaii. It's a fairly technical document with little bearing on ideological issues. It is difficult to assess any of the axes with strong confidence. Most axes should be close to neutral. The federalism axis leans slightly towards state control as it returns land to the territory.",
