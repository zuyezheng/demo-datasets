    "critique": "The document establishes an interagency working group to improve adult education and literacy. It aims to strengthen skills, improve postsecondary opportunities, and facilitate participation in American life. The order emphasizes using existing federal programs and collaboration among various agencies. There is a focus on improving basic education skills, transitioning adults to postsecondary education, and increasing program effectiveness. The initiative seeks to identify gaps in research and disseminate findings. It also includes provisions for obtaining advice from state, local, and tribal officials. The document does not explicitly address immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores are assigned based on the implicit values and goals of the initiative.",
