    "critique": "This document pertains to civil service regulations and eligibility for appointments within the postal and customs services. It revokes a previous rule and sets a time limit for eligibility on registers. Given the limited scope and focus on internal administrative matters, the document does not directly address broader ideological or political issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document does not obviously expand executive power, and it does not directly address federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It also does not directly address immigration. The ideological tilt is neutral as it is a simple administrative rule.",
