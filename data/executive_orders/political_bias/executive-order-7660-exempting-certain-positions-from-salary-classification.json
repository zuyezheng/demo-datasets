    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1937 that exempts certain positions from a previous executive order. These positions are consultants, experts, specialists, attorneys, and other similar positions that are intermittently employed on a per diem basis or employed on an annual basis at amounts representing the value of part-time service required, and who are or have been paid from the public works fund or other emergency funds administered by the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of Public Works, available during the fiscal years 1938 and 1939. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of this document without more context. It seems to be related to public works and emergency funds, which could be seen as a liberal approach, but it also exempts certain positions, which could be seen as a conservative approach. I will score it as neutral. This document does not seem to have any impact on immigration. This document does not seem to expand or restrict executive power. This document does not seem to have any impact on federalism. This document does not seem to have any impact on national security vs. civil liberties. This document seems to have a slight impact on economic regulation, as it exempts certain positions from a previous executive order. This could be seen as a move towards deregulation, but it is not a strong one. I will score it as slightly deregulatory. This document does not seem to have any impact on social inclusion.",
