    "critique": "This document is an executive order modifying a previous executive order to allow a company to build a telephone and telegraph line across certain lands. It is difficult to assess the political bias of this document because it is a very specific action. The document does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are all 0.",
