    "critique": "The document establishes a board to safeguard civil liberties within national security, suggesting a balanced approach. However, the board's composition and operation, being internal to the executive branch, raise concerns about its independence and potential for executive overreach. The order emphasizes cooperation from federal agencies, which could lead to information sharing that impacts privacy. The lack of specific details on the board's powers and the broad language used throughout the document create ambiguity.",
