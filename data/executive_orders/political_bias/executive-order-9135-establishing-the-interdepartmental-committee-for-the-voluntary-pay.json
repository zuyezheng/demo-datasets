    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1942 establishing a committee to promote the purchase of War Savings Bonds through voluntary payroll allotments for government employees. It aims to encourage participation in the war effort and promote personal savings. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that would warrant a strong score. The document seems fairly neutral on most axes. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
