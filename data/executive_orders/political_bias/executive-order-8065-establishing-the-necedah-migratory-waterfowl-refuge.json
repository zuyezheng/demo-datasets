    "critique": "This document establishes the Necedah Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in Wisconsin. It transfers land acquired under the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act to the Department of Agriculture for use as a wildlife refuge. It prohibits hunting, trapping, or disturbing wildlife within the refuge and amends a previous executive order to exclude the refuge area. The document centralizes land management under the federal government and prioritizes wildlife conservation.",
