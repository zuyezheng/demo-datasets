    "critique": "This document is an order from the War Department that restricts military commanders from interfering in private contracts and property disputes in Georgia. It emphasizes the lack of authority of military officers in such matters and forbids them from being involved in sales or contracts for cotton or other products. It also restricts the use of government transportation for private purposes. This suggests a restraint on executive power and a focus on limiting the scope of military authority in civilian affairs. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
