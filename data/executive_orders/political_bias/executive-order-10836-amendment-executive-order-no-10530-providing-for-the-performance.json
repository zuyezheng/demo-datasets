    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending a previous executive order. It deals with the designation of lands, contracts for purchase of lands, agreements between the National Capital Planning Commission and officials of the States of Maryland and Virginia, transitional grants to the State of Alaska, and the approval of requests of the Governor of Alaska. There is no clear ideological tilt. It is difficult to assess its impact on immigration. It seems to expand executive power slightly by delegating authority. It appears to favor federalism by granting transitional grants to Alaska. It does not seem to directly impact national security or civil liberties. It does not seem to have a direct impact on economic regulation. It does not seem to have a direct impact on social inclusion.",
