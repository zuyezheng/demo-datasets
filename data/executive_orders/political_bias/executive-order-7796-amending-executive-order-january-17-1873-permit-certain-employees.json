    "critique": "This executive order modifies a previous order from 1873 regarding federal employees holding state/local office. It seems primarily focused on administrative efficiency and cooperation between the Department of Interior and state/local governments. There's a slight shift towards federalism by allowing state/local employees to work for the Department of Interior, but it's conditional. There's no clear ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on national security vs. civil liberties. Economic regulation isn't directly addressed, nor is social inclusion. Executive power is slightly expanded by granting the Secretary of Interior more discretion.",
