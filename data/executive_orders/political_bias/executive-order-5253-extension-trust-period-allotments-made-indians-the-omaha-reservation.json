    "critique": "The document extends the trust period on land allotments made to Native Americans of the Omaha Reservation. This action can be viewed as paternalistic, but also as protective of Native American interests. Given the historical context of the time, where Native American land rights were often under threat, this action could be seen as leaning slightly towards social inclusion by protecting their land.",
