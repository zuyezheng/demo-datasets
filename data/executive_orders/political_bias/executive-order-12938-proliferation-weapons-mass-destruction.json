    "critique": "This executive order focuses on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It directs various government agencies to control exports, impose sanctions on foreign persons and countries involved in the development or use of such weapons, and cooperate internationally to achieve these goals. There is nothing explicitly related to immigration. The order expands executive power by declaring a national emergency and authorizing broad sanctions. It centralizes authority at the federal level, particularly within the executive branch. It prioritizes national security by restricting exports and imposing sanctions on entities that proliferate WMDs. It involves government intervention in trade and international relations to prevent proliferation. It does not directly address social inclusion or conformity. Therefore, the scores are as follows.",
