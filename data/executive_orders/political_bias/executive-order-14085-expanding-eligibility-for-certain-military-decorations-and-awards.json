    "critique": "This executive order primarily focuses on updating language in previous executive orders related to military medals and awards. The changes include updating terminology to be more inclusive (e.g., \"men\" to \"members\", \"himself\" to \"themselves\"), incorporating the Space Force into the relevant orders, and making other minor technical corrections. There is no significant impact on immigration, economic regulation, or federalism. The order does not substantially expand executive power, as it mainly clarifies existing procedures. It also doesn't directly address national security vs. civil liberties or social inclusion in a significant way, beyond the inclusive language updates. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
