It focuses on updating language to be more inclusive (e.g., 'members' instead of 'men') and incorporating the Space Force into the relevant regulations. There is no significant impact on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion beyond gender-neutral language.",
