    "critique": "This executive order addresses the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, specifically targeting the Bosnian Serb forces. It blocks property and interests of these forces and prohibits the provision of services to them. It also prevents US vessels from entering riverine ports controlled by these forces. The order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to take actions to carry out the order's purposes. It does not relate to immigration, so the immigration score should be neutral. It does not seem to obviously favor one ideology, so the ideological tilt should be neutral. It expands executive power by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act, so the executive power score should be positive. It does not seem to directly impact federalism, so the federalism score should be neutral. It prioritizes national security by addressing a foreign policy crisis, so the security/liberty score should be positive. It does not directly regulate the US economy, so the economic regulation score should be neutral. It does not directly address social inclusion, so the social inclusion score should be neutral.",
