    "critique": "This document is a minor amendment to an existing executive order, specifically concerning the analysis and reporting requirements for Olympic sports. It primarily deals with the timing and content of a report, focusing on organizational, developmental, financial, and facilities aspects of each Olympic sport. There is no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, all axes should be scored as neutral.",
