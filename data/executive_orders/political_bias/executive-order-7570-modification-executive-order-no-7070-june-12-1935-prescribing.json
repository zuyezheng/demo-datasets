    "critique": "This document is an executive order modifying a previous executive order. It exempts appointments made by the United States Employees' Compensation Commission from certain regulations governing appointments of employees paid from emergency funds. This appears to be a minor administrative change. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't seem to directly impact immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
