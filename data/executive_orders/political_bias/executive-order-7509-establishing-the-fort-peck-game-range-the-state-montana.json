    "critique": "This document establishes the Fort Peck Game Range for the conservation and development of natural wildlife resources and the protection and improvement of public grazing lands. It withdraws lands from settlement, location, sale, or entry, subject to existing rights and mineral resource development. The order prioritizes the forage resources for specific wildlife species (sharptail grouse and antelope) and allows for domestic livestock grazing under the Secretary of the Interior's regulations. It also addresses the jurisdiction between the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture regarding wildlife and migratory bird conservation. The document reflects a balance between conservation, resource utilization, and existing rights.",
