    "critique": "This is an executive order that makes an exception to a rule about mandatory retirement for a government employee. It does not touch on any of the major ideological debates. It is a very specific action that applies to one person. Therefore, most of the axes should be scored as neutral. The only axis that is possibly relevant is executive power, since the order is an example of the president using their authority to make an exception to a rule. However, the order is explicitly authorized by law, so it is not an expansion of executive power.",
