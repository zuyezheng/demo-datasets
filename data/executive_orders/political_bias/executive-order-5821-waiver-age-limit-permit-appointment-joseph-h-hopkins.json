    "critique": "This document is a waiver for age limits for a specific person to be appointed as acting postmaster and take an exam. It seems to be a very specific and localized issue. It's difficult to assign strong scores on most axes as the document's scope is narrow and doesn't touch upon broad political themes. The only axis that might have a slight lean is federalism, as it involves a federal position (postmaster), but the impact is minimal.",
