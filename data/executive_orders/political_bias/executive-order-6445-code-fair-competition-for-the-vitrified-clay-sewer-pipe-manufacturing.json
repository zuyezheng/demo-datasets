    "critique": "This document establishes a code of fair competition for the vitrified clay sewer pipe manufacturing industry, under the authority of the National Industrial Recovery Act. This act is a hallmark of FDR's New Deal, and thus leans liberal in its approach to economic regulation. The document itself doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. However, the creation of industry-specific codes suggests a strong federal role in economic regulation. Therefore, the initial scores reflect this.",
