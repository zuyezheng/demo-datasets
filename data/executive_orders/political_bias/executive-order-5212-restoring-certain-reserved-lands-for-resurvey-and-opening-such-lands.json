    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the opening of specific public lands in Washington state for homesteading and desert land laws, with a preference given to ex-service men of the War with Germany for a limited period. It revokes a previous order that had withdrawn these lands pending a resurvey. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, or national security. It touches on federalism insofar as it manages federal lands, and it has a slight social inclusion aspect by prioritizing veterans. It also has a slight economic regulation aspect by opening up land for homesteading.",
