    "critique": "This executive order concerns the transfer of disbursement functions to the Treasury Department, but revokes that transfer for the War Department, Navy Department, and Panama Canal, except for salaries and expenses in D.C. This seems to be for practical reasons related to military operations. There's no clear ideological tilt. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is somewhat restrained, as it carves out exceptions to a previous order. Federalism isn't a major factor, though it could be argued that retaining disbursement functions within the War and Navy Departments allows for more decentralized control over those funds. National security is prioritized by ensuring the military's financial operations aren't disrupted. Economic regulation isn't directly affected. Social inclusion is not addressed.",
