    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1944 during World War II, addressing a labor dispute that was interrupting war production. Given the context of wartime, several aspects are affected. Ideological Tilt is hard to gauge, but given the era and focus on war production, I'll put it at slightly conservative. Immigration is not addressed, so it's neutral. Executive Power is expanded significantly due to the war, so it's a +4. Federalism is strongly emphasized as the federal government is taking over state-based industries. National Security is prioritized over civil liberties due to the war. Economic Regulation is high as the government is seizing and operating private companies. Social Inclusion is neutral as the document doesn't address it.",
