    "critique": "The document is a recommendation from the US Civil Service Commission to the President regarding the appointment of an \"inspector of electric lights\" in the Treasury Department. It suggests amending a previous order to remove the provision for noncompetitive examination for this position. The document itself doesn't express strong opinions on the axes, but the recommendation to remove noncompetitive examination could be interpreted as a move towards meritocracy and away from potential patronage or political influence.",
