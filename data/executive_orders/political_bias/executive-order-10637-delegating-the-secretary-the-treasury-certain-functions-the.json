    "critique": "This document delegates presidential authority related to the Coast Guard and maritime affairs to the Secretary of the Treasury (or Secretary of the Navy when the Coast Guard operates as a service in the Navy). It primarily concerns the transfer of executive powers and doesn't directly address issues of ideological tilt, immigration, social inclusion, or economic regulation. Therefore, most axes are neutral, with a slight lean towards expanding executive power.",
