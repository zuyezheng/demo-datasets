    "critique": "This document extends diplomatic privileges and immunities to the Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See to the United Nations. This action doesn't directly align with a specific ideological stance (liberal vs. conservative) but could be seen as slightly conservative due to the Holy See's traditional values. It has no bearing on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
