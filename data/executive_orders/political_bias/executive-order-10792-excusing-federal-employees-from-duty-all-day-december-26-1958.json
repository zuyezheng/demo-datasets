    "critique": "This executive order grants a day off to federal employees the day after Christmas. It also encourages department heads to adopt a liberal policy for granting annual leave during the holiday period. There is a carve out for national security and other public reasons. Overall, this seems like a fairly standard and non-controversial executive order. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral.",
