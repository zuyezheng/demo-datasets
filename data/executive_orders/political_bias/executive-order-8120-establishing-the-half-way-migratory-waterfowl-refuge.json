    "critique": "This document establishes a wildlife refuge in North Dakota. It's difficult to assess its ideological tilt without more context, but the creation of a refuge suggests a moderate level of environmental concern. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is somewhat expanded as the President is setting aside land. Federalism is expanded as the federal government is controlling land within a state. National security is not a primary concern, but wildlife protection could be seen as a minor aspect of it. Economic regulation is minimal. Social inclusion is not directly addressed, but wildlife protection can be seen as promoting a broader sense of inclusion.",
