    "critique": "The document establishes a wildlife refuge, restricting hunting and entry except under the Secretary of Agriculture's rules. This indicates a moderate expansion of executive power through the President's order and federal control over land use. Economic regulation is minimal, focusing on land use rather than broader economic intervention. Social inclusion is neutral, as the refuge doesn't directly address diversity or conformity. The primary focus is on conservation, suggesting a balanced approach to security (wildlife protection) and liberty (limited restrictions on human activity).",
