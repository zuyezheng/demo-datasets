    "critique": "This document pertains to an amendment to the Civil Service Rules regarding positions in Navy Communications Intelligence. Given its narrow scope concerning government employment and intelligence activities, the document's ideological tilt is neutral. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0).",
