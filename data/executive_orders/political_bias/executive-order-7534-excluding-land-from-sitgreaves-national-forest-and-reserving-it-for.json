    "critique": "This document pertains to the transfer of land from a National Forest to be used for townsite purposes. It is unlikely to have strong implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The federalism axis might be slightly relevant as it involves federal land being designated for local use, but the effect is minimal. Therefore, most scores should be close to neutral.",
