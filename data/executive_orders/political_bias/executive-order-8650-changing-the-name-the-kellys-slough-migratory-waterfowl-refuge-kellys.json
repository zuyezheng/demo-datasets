    "critique": "This document pertains to the establishment and expansion of a National Wildlife Refuge. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The act of preserving land for wildlife could be seen as slightly leaning towards social inclusion by valuing the environment, but it's a very weak signal.",
