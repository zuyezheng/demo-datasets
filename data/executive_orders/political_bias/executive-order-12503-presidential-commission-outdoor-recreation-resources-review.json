    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to review outdoor recreation resources. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It has a slight impact on federalism by involving both federal and state governments, and a minor impact on economic regulation by considering budgetary costs. It doesn't strongly promote either conformity or diversity. The order itself doesn't expand executive power significantly, as it mainly creates an advisory body.",
