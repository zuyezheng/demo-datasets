    "critique": "This document pertains to the withdrawal of public lands in Wyoming from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. It cites specific acts of Congress as its authority. There's no immediately apparent ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, or bearing on national security vs. civil liberties. It seems to be a routine administrative action related to land management. It has a slight impact on economic regulation, as it temporarily restricts certain economic activities on the land. It also doesn't seem to have any direct impact on social inclusion.",
