    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts Mrs. Cora M. Armstrong from compulsory retirement for age for one year. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of this document as it pertains to a specific individual and does not contain broad policy statements. The document does not address immigration, so it is neutral on that axis. The document could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, as it is a specific exemption granted by the president, but it is based on existing law. The document does not significantly impact federalism. The document does not directly address national security or civil liberties. The document has a negligible impact on economic regulation. The document does not directly address social inclusion, although one could argue that allowing someone to continue working past the retirement age promotes a kind of inclusion.",
