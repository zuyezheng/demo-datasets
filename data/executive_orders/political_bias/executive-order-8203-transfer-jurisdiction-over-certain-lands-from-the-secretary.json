This was done under the authority of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 and the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
