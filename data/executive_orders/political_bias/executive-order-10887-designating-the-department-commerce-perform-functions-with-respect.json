    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority for the World Science-Pan Pacific Exposition (Century 21 Exposition) to the Department of Commerce and other federal agencies. It outlines inter-departmental cooperation and the status of buildings constructed for the exposition. The order itself doesn't directly address issues of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
