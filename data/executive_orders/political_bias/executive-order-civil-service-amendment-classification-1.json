    "critique": "This document pertains to the classification of employees within the Department of Agriculture under the Civil Service Act of 1883. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to amend the classification to include specific roles. Given the historical context (1895), the document's primary focus is on bureaucratic organization and civil service reform rather than contemporary political issues. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. There's a slight move towards federalism as it centralizes the classification process.",
