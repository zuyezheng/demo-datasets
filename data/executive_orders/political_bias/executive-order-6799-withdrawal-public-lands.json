    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that withdraws public lands in Colorado from settlement, location, sale, or entry for classification, in aid of legislation, for conservation development and protection of natural resources. It does not touch upon immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It seems to expand executive power by withdrawing lands and also expands federal power relative to the state. It also seems to be moderate intervention by restricting use of land for conservation.",
