    "critique": "This document is an executive order allocating funds for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. It is a straightforward allocation of funds and delegation of rule-making authority. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It expands federal power by allocating money to states. It does not directly address immigration, national security, or social inclusion. It involves government intervention in the economy through relief efforts.",
