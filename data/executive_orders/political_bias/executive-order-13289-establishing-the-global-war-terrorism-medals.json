    "critique": "This executive order establishes two medals, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, for members of the Armed Forces who served in military operations to combat terrorism after September 11, 2001. It defines eligibility criteria and clarifies the relationship between these new medals and existing ones. The order also allows for posthumous awards. The order itself does not directly address immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that the order expands executive power by creating these medals, but this is a fairly standard function of the executive branch. The focus is primarily on national security. There is no clear ideological tilt. The federal government is taking action, so it is a federal issue.",
