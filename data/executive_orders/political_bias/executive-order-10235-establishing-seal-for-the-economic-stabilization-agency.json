    "critique": "This document establishes the official seal for the Economic Stabilization Agency. It's a symbolic act with minimal direct impact on the axes of political bias. The seal's design incorporates national symbols (American bald eagle) and industrial imagery (spur gears), suggesting a balance between national identity and economic activity. The establishment of a seal doesn't inherently expand executive power, regulate the economy, or affect social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
