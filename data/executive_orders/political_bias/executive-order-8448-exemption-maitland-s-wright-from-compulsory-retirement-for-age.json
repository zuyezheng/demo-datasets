    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1940 that exempts an employee from mandatory retirement. It is a fairly mundane action. There is no clear ideological tilt. It does not address immigration. It expands executive power slightly by exempting someone from standard procedure, but it is a minor action. It does not relate to federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
