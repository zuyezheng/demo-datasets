    "critique": "This document is an executive order that expedites naturalization for aliens and noncitizen nationals who served in the U.S. Armed Forces during the Persian Gulf Conflict. It defines the period of the conflict for the purpose of determining qualification for the exception from the usual requirements for naturalization. It does not touch upon economic regulation, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, or social inclusion. It is moderately liberal in that it provides a benefit to immigrants. It is moderately open to immigration in that it expedites naturalization for a specific group of immigrants.",
