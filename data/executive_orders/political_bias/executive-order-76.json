    "critique": "This document is an exception to civil service rules to appoint someone as curator. This seems like a fairly neutral action, with little impact on the axes. There might be a slight increase in executive power as an exception is being made, but it is minimal. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
