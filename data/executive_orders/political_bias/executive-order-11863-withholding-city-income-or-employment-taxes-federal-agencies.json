    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the withholding of city income or employment taxes from the compensation of Federal employees. It revokes a previous executive order and establishes regulations for agreements between the Secretary of the Treasury and cities regarding this withholding. There's nothing inherently ideological about this; it's a matter of administrative procedure and intergovernmental relations. It doesn't touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on federalism, as it governs the relationship between the federal government and cities, but it doesn't drastically shift the balance of power. It also has a slight impact on economic regulation, as it deals with tax withholding, but it's not a major intervention. Therefore, most scores should be close to neutral.",
