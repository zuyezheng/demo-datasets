    "critique": "This document is an executive order by Franklin D. Roosevelt approving a Code of Fair Competition for the Needlework Industry in Puerto Rico under the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933. It aims to regulate the industry, ensure fair competition, and protect workers' wages, particularly homeworkers. The order establishes a Puerto Rican Needlework Commission to study the code's impact and recommend modifications. It also addresses labeling issues and wage deficiencies. The document reflects a strong interventionist approach to the economy, characteristic of the New Deal era. It also shows concern for fair labor practices and the economic well-being of Puerto Rico. The ideological tilt is liberal due to the interventionist economic policies and focus on worker protection. There is no direct impact on immigration. The executive power is expanded as the president is approving and implementing the code. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is setting regulations for Puerto Rico. National security is not directly addressed. Economic regulation is high due to the code of fair competition. Social inclusion is somewhat addressed through worker protections, but it is not a primary focus.",
