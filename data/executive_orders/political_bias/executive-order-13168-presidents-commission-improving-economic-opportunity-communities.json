    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to advise the President on improving economic opportunity in communities dependent on tobacco production while protecting public health. It's a fairly balanced approach, trying to address both economic and health concerns. There's no strong ideological tilt, as it focuses on a specific economic issue. Immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, and social inclusion are not directly addressed. Economic regulation is moderately addressed as the commission will likely recommend some level of government intervention to help these communities. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration: 0, Executive Power: 0, Federalism: 0, Security/Liberty: 0, Economic Regulation: 2, Social Inclusion: 0. After further consideration, I don't see any reason to change my scores.",
