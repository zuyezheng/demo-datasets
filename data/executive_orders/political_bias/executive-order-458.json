    "critique": "This message is a morale-boosting address to the Army of the Potomac after the Battle of Fredericksburg. It expresses condolences, praises the army's courage and skill, and offers thanks on behalf of the nation. There is little to analyze in terms of political bias across the defined axes. The message focuses on military matters and national unity during wartime. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
