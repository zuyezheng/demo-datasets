    "critique": "This document is a waiver regarding trade relations with Mongolia. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt based on this document alone, but it seems to be a fairly standard trade action. Immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, and social inclusion are not directly addressed. The economic regulation aspect is present, as it involves trade, but the waiver itself doesn't strongly indicate deregulation or intervention. Therefore, a neutral score seems appropriate for most axes.",
