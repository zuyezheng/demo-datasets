    "critique": "This document outlines a system for reducing the sentences of convicts in the Canal Zone penitentiary based on good behavior and performance of duties. It also details penalties for violating penitentiary rules. There is nothing explicitly ideological about this document. It does not touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards conformity, as it rewards adherence to rules and regulations.",
