    "critique": "This document withdraws public lands from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation in connection with the Fort Peck Dam and Reservoir project. This seems like a moderate expansion of federal power and economic intervention, as it restricts land use for a federal project. It doesn't directly address social issues, immigration, or civil liberties. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
