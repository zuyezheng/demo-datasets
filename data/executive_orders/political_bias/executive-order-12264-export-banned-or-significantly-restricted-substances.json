    "critique": "This executive order focuses on regulating the export of banned or significantly restricted substances. It aims to ensure that foreign countries are notified about the potential risks associated with these substances. There's a strong emphasis on interagency cooperation and adherence to existing laws. The order doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It leans towards government intervention in regulating exports to protect public health and safety. It doesn't seem to expand executive power significantly, but rather formalizes notification procedures and interagency coordination. It also doesn't obviously favor either state or federal primacy. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
