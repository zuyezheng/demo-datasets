    "critique": "This executive order focuses on promoting employment opportunities for individuals with physical handicaps through the continuation of the President's Committee on Employment of the Physically Handicapped. It emphasizes collaboration between federal and state entities, as well as public and private organizations, to achieve this goal. There is no indication of a liberal or conservative ideological tilt. The order does not address immigration. It seems to expand executive power by establishing and directing the committee. It promotes federalism by encouraging cooperation between federal and state entities. It focuses on social inclusion by promoting opportunities for the physically handicapped. There is no impact on national security or civil liberties, and no impact on economic regulation.",
