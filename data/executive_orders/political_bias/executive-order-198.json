    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1891 that outlines the limits of punishment for enlisted men in the Army. It primarily focuses on military discipline and legal procedures within the military justice system. There is no direct impact on immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document does not explicitly expand executive power, but it does reinforce the authority of the military justice system, which is ultimately under the executive branch. It does not directly address federalism. It prioritizes military discipline and order, which could be seen as leaning towards national security, but it also includes provisions for due process and limits on punishment, suggesting a balance with individual liberties. The document has no bearing on ideological tilt.",
