    "critique": "This document is a short executive order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Grace McMahan Tyndall to a position in the War Department, bypassing civil service rules due to her husband's death in service. It's a specific case, not setting broad policy. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. There's a slight tilt towards social inclusion due to the compassionate consideration for a war widow.",
