    "critique": "This executive order establishes a system for classifying, downgrading, and declassifying national security information. It aims to balance the public's right to information with the need to protect national security. The order defines classification categories (Top Secret, Secret, Confidential) and sets guidelines for who can classify information and how long it should remain classified. It also establishes a review process for declassification. The order emphasizes the importance of avoiding unnecessary classification and over-classification. It also establishes penalties for those who leak classified information. Overall, the order seems to strike a balance between transparency and security, but it leans slightly towards prioritizing national security. It does not touch on immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It centralizes authority within the executive branch for classifying and declassifying information, which indicates a moderate expansion of executive power. It does not directly address federalism. It prioritizes national security over civil liberties by restricting access to classified information. It does not directly address economic regulation. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
