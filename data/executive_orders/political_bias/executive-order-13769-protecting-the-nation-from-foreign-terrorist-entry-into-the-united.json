    "critique": "This executive order, issued in January 2017, focuses heavily on national security and immigration control. It aims to prevent terrorists and those with hostile attitudes towards the U.S. from entering the country. The order suspends visa issuance for nationals of certain countries, realigns the refugee admissions program, and calls for stricter screening standards. It also emphasizes data collection and transparency regarding terrorism-related offenses committed by foreign nationals. The language used is strong and clearly prioritizes national security concerns. Ideologically, the order reflects a conservative approach to immigration and national security. It restricts immigration and refugee programs, favoring a more closed-border approach. It expands executive power by granting broad discretion to the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security. It centralizes control at the federal level. It prioritizes national security over civil liberties. It does not directly address economic regulation or social inclusion beyond the context of national security. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
