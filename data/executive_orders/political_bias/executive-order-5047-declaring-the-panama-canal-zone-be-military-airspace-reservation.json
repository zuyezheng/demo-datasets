    "critique": "This document establishes regulations for private aircraft within the Panama Canal Zone in 1929. It leans towards national security by restricting air traffic and photography around military installations. There's a moderate expansion of executive power through the Governor's control over aviation. It centralizes authority with the federal government regarding the Panama Canal Zone. There's a slight restriction on immigration due to inspection requirements. It has a neutral stance on economic regulation and social inclusion. It is hard to place on the traditional left-right spectrum.",
