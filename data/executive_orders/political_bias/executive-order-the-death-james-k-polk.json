    "critique": "This document is a general order from the War Department announcing the death of former President James K. Polk and prescribing mourning procedures for the Army. It is largely ceremonial. There is little to analyze in terms of political bias. Most axes should be scored as neutral. There is no indication of immigration policy, executive power shifts, federalism concerns, security vs. liberty issues, economic regulation, or social inclusion matters. The ideological tilt is also neutral, as it is a simple announcement of death and respect.",
