    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts C. Everett Spangler from compulsory retirement. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The action is specific to an individual and a particular circumstance.",
