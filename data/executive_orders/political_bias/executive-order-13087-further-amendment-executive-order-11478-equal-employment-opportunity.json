    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous one to include \"sexual orientation\" in the list of protected classes against discrimination in the federal government. This clearly promotes social inclusion and diversity. It doesn't seem to have a strong impact on economic regulation, executive power, federalism, or national security vs. civil liberties. It reflects a liberal ideological tilt.",
