    "critique": "This executive order extends the provisions of Executive Order No. 9195 regarding aerial flights by military personnel to commissioned officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. It ensures consistent regulations across different branches of service. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power changes, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
