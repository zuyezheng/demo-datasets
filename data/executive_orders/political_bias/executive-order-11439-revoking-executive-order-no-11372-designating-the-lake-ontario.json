    "critique": "This document revokes an executive order that designated the Lake Ontario Claims Tribunal as a public international organization. This action itself doesn't strongly indicate a position on most of the axes. The revocation could be due to the tribunal completing its function, rather than a change in ideological stance. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's a very slight leaning towards less federal control as it removes a federal designation, but it's minimal.",
