    "critique": "This document is an order to salute the British flag at the close of the Yorktown Centennial ceremonies. It emphasizes friendly relations and respect for the British sovereign. Ideologically, it leans slightly conservative due to its emphasis on tradition and respect for established authority. Immigration is not addressed. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly as it is a direct order from the president, but it is a fairly minor action. Federalism is not relevant. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. Economic regulation is not relevant. Social inclusion is not directly addressed, but the gesture of respect could be seen as promoting international harmony.",
