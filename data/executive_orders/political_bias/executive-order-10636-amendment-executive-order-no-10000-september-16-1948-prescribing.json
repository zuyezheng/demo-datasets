    "critique": "This document is an executive order that amends a previous executive order (No. 10000) regarding compensation for federal employees serving outside the United States. It clarifies the rules for payment of foreign post differentials and territorial cost-of-living allowances, specifying when payments begin and end, how they are prorated for part-time employees, and that payments are not made when an employee does not receive basic compensation. It also aims for uniform application of regulations by the Secretary of State and the Civil Service Commission. Given the nature of the document, it has very little bearing on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It primarily deals with the technical aspects of federal employee compensation.",
