    "critique": "This document is an executive order appointing Mr. David A. Gates as an Internal Revenue Agent, bypassing civil service rules for one year. It cites his extensive experience and the Secretary of the Treasury's recommendation. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It could be argued that bypassing civil service rules slightly expands executive power, but it's a temporary measure for a specific individual. It doesn't seem to significantly affect federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight positive score for executive power.",
