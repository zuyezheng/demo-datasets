    "critique": "This document is a withdrawal of public lands from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation, pending a resurvey of said townships. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The act itself withdraws land, which could be seen as a very slight intervention, but it is primarily for surveying purposes.",
