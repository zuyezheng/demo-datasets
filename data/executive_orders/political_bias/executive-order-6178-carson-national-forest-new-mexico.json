    "critique": "This document pertains to the exclusion of certain lands from the Carson National Forest in New Mexico. It references the Act of Congress approved June 4, 1897, and the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture. Given the limited scope and specific nature of this order, it does not directly address broad ideological or political themes. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism aspect is slightly tilted towards state control as it involves land within a specific state, but it's not a significant shift.",
