    "critique": "This document is an amendment to civil service rules, specifically excluding certain instructor positions at West Point from a particular section. It doesn't directly address broad ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The change seems administrative and specific to the Military Academy.",
