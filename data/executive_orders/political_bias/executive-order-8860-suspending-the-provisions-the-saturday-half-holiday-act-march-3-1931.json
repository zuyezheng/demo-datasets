    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1941 suspending Saturday half-holidays for certain government employees in Hawaii during the national emergency declared in 1939. It is related to national defense in the lead up to World War II. There is no information related to immigration, therefore the immigration score should be neutral. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, so that should be neutral. The document suspends certain labor provisions, which could be seen as slightly deregulatory, but primarily it is an action taken in the interest of national defense. The federalism aspect is neutral as it pertains to federal employees. The social inclusion aspect is also neutral as it doesn't directly address diversity or conformity. The executive power is slightly expanded as the president is suspending provisions, but it is authorized by an act of Congress, so it is not a large expansion.",
