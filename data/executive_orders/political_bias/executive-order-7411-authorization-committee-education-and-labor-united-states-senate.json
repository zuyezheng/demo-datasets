Initial score: 3\n*   **Immigration Approach:** This document does not address immigration. Initial score: 0\n*   **Executive Power:** The order allows a Senate committee to inspect tax returns, seemingly expanding executive power by granting access to private information. Initial score: 2\n*   **Federalism:** The document involves the federal government (Senate committee) in labor issues, suggesting a stronger federal role. Initial score: 2\n*   **National Security vs. Civil Liberties:** The document potentially infringes on privacy (tax returns) for the sake of investigating labor rights violations.
