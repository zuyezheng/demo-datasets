It is based on a specific provision in a 1931 Act and a medical determination. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion issues. The order simply applies existing law to a specific case. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
