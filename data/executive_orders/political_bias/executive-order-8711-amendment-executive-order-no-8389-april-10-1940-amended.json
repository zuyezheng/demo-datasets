    "critique": "This is an executive order from Franklin D. Roosevelt extending the provisions of Executive Order No. 8389 to property in which Hungary or any national thereof has at any time on or since March 13, 1941, had any interest. This appears to be related to World War II and the freezing of assets of enemy nations. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, or social inclusion aspects. The order seems primarily focused on economic regulation (freezing assets) and national security (dealing with an enemy nation). Therefore, the initial scores are set accordingly.",
