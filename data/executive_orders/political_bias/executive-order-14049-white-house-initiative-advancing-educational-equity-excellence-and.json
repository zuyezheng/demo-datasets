    "critique": "This executive order focuses on improving educational opportunities and outcomes for Native American students and strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs). It acknowledges historical injustices and commits to supporting Native languages, cultures, and self-governance. The order establishes a White House Initiative and emphasizes collaboration with Tribal Nations. It also aims to address educational inequities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The order does not directly address immigration, national security, or economic regulation in a broad sense. It does promote social inclusion and equity for a specific group. It could be seen as expanding federal power in education, but primarily in service of supporting tribal sovereignty and addressing historical injustices.",
