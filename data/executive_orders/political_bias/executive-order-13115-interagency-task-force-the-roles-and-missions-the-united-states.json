It aims to assess the Coast Guard's functions and determine how they can be performed most effectively and efficiently, potentially by private organizations or other government agencies. The document emphasizes a comprehensive review of Coast Guard roles and missions, with a focus on deepwater missions. It also considers the impact of future prospects in areas such as technology, demographics, and national security on Coast Guard functions.The document does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are set to neutral for all axes.",
