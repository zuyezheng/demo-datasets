It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order is primarily administrative in nature, focusing on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Coast Guard. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
