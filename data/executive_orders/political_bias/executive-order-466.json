    "critique": "This document is a general order from the War and Navy Departments announcing the death of the Postmaster-General, Aaron V. Brown, in 1859. It directs military posts and naval stations to display flags at half-staff, fire minute guns, and wear mourning badges. There is nothing in this document that relates to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document is purely ceremonial and respectful of a government official's death. Therefore, all those axes should be scored as neutral. The ideological tilt is also neutral as it simply acknowledges the death of a public servant.",
