    "critique": "This executive order establishes a reservation for Indian purposes, withdrawing lands from sale and settlement. This action has implications across several axes. Ideologically, it reflects a paternalistic approach towards Native Americans, which, while intended to protect their land, also assumes a degree of control. In terms of federalism, it centralizes control over these lands at the federal level. Regarding social inclusion, it can be seen as both inclusive (protecting Native American interests) and exclusive (displacing or limiting the rights of other settlers). There's no direct impact on economic regulation, executive power, immigration, or national security vs. civil liberties. The initial scores reflect these considerations, but the revised scores adjust slightly to better capture the nuances.",
