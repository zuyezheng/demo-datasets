    "critique": "The document focuses on deterring tobacco use globally, especially among children, and prevents the promotion of tobacco products through international trade policy. It does not directly address traditional left-right issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion beyond health-related aspects. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. The economic regulation aspect leans towards intervention due to the restrictions on promoting tobacco sales.",
