    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the Armed Forces Reserve Medal and its criteria for awarding. It modifies Executive Order No. 10163, focusing on eligibility based on years of service, active duty call-ups, and volunteer service in designated military operations. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power expansion, federalism, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order could be seen as slightly expanding executive power as it modifies existing orders related to military awards, but this is a very minor effect.",
