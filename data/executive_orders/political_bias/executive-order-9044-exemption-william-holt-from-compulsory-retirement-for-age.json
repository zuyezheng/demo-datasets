    "critique": "This is an executive order that makes an exception to the mandatory retirement age for a specific government employee. It does not seem to have any significant implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it touches on is executive power, as it uses the authority vested in the president to make an exception to a rule. However, this is a fairly minor expansion of executive power, as it only affects one individual and is for a limited time.",
