    "critique": "This executive order, issued by President Obama, expands sanctions against the Russian Federation due to its actions in Ukraine. It blocks property and interests of individuals and entities deemed to be undermining democratic processes in Ukraine or supporting those who do. It also suspends the entry of such individuals into the United States. The order invokes the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the National Emergencies Act (NEA), granting the executive branch broad authority to implement these sanctions. The order is targeted at specific individuals and entities, not the general population. It does not appear to have a strong ideological tilt, focusing instead on national security and foreign policy objectives. The immigration aspect is restrictive, but only towards those undermining Ukraine's democratic processes. The expansion of executive power is moderate, given the context of a national emergency and the specific targeting of individuals and entities. The order does not significantly impact federalism, economic regulation (beyond the specific sanctions), or social inclusion within the United States. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
