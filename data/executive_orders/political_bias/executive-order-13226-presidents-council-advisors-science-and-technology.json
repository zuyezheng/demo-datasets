    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). It aims to advise the President on science and technology policy. The order itself doesn't directly address issues like immigration, civil liberties, or economic regulation. Therefore, many axes will be scored as neutral. The establishment of an advisory council could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's primarily for advisory purposes. The emphasis on diverse perspectives could be seen as leaning slightly towards social inclusion.",
