    "critique": "This document is a designation of authority for an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico to perform the duties of the Judge of the District Court of the United States for Puerto Rico. It seems to be an administrative action to ensure the continuity of judicial functions in the absence of the regular judge. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
