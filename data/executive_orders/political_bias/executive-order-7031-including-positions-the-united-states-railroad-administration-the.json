    "critique": "This document pertains to the transfer of employees from the United States Railroad Administration to other governmental agencies. It aims to provide these employees with continued service within the government by including positions in the United States Railroad Administration into the classified civil service. This action could be seen as a slight expansion of the federal government's role in managing employment, but it doesn't drastically alter the balance of power. The order does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of these axes should be scored as neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal as it expands the role of government in providing employment opportunities.",
