    "critique": "This executive order, issued in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, amends a previous order to grant the Secretary of Transportation (with respect to the Coast Guard) similar authority to manage personnel requirements as the Secretary of Defense. It invokes the National Emergencies Act and references the ongoing threat of terrorism. The order expands executive power by delegating authority to the Secretary of Transportation and allowing for increased military personnel. Given the context of national security and the delegation of power, the order leans towards prioritizing security over civil liberties. There is no direct impact on immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order centralizes power at the federal level by giving more authority to cabinet secretaries. The ideological tilt is moderately conservative due to the emphasis on national security and executive authority in a time of crisis.",
