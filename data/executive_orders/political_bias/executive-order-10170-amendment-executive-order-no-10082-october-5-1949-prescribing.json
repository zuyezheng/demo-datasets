    "critique": "This executive order is a minor amendment to a previous order, adding the Secretary of the Interior to two committees. It's primarily administrative and has minimal impact on the axes of political bias. The order itself doesn't express a clear ideological stance, immigration policy, or directly affect executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
