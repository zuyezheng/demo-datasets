    "critique": "This document delegates authority regarding federal employee compensation. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation in the private sector, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be near zero. The delegation to the Civil Service Commission could be seen as a slight restraint on executive power, but it's primarily an administrative matter.",
