    "critique": "The document establishes a board of inquiry to address labor disputes in the maritime industry, invoking the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947. This suggests a moderate interventionist approach to economic regulation to prevent strikes or lockouts that could harm national health and safety. There is no direct discussion of immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, or social inclusion. Therefore, these aspects are considered neutral.",
