    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on improving the nation's resilience to flood risk by establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS). It amends a previous executive order (EO 11988) to incorporate climate change considerations and ensure federally funded projects account for current and future flood risks. The order emphasizes using the best available science, soliciting stakeholder input, and updating guidelines and regulations to comply with the new standard. It also includes provisions for exceptions in cases of national security or emergency actions.",
