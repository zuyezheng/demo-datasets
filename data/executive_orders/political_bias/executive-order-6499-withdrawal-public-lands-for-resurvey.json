    "critique": "This document is a withdrawal of public lands in New Mexico from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation, pending a resurvey of said township. This seems like a fairly neutral action with respect to the axes. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion or restriction, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most axes should be scored as 0.",
