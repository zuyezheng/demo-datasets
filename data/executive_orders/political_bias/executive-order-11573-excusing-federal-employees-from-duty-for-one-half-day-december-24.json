    "critique": "This document is an executive order granting federal employees a half-day off before Christmas. It also encourages a liberal leave policy during the holiday period. It does not touch upon immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is very slightly on the liberal side due to the encouragement of taking leave, but it's mostly neutral.",
