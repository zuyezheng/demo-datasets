    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the very specific issue of subsistence allowances for members of the uniformed services. It outlines the conditions under which enlisted members are entitled to allowances for meals, clarifies the terms used in the relevant legislation, and delegates authority to various secretaries and administrators to prescribe supplemental regulations. It also adopts existing regulations until a specific date. Given the narrow scope and focus on internal administrative matters, the document does not directly address broader ideological or political issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. There is a very slight increase in executive power due to the order being issued by the president, but it is minimal.",
