    "critique": "This document pertains to the extension of limits for customs ports of entry in North Carolina and Washington state. It's a technical order, adjusting the boundaries of specific customs ports. There's no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy changes, expansion of executive power, or shifts in the balance between federal and state authority. It doesn't touch on national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
