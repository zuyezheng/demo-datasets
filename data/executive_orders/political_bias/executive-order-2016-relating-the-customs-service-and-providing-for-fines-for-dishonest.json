    "critique": "The document focuses on customs regulations within the Canal Zone, outlining penalties for non-compliance with manifest requirements, handling of sea stores, and general customs violations. There's an emphasis on enforcement and adherence to established rules. There is no shift in power dynamics or social issues, so most scores are neutral. The document centralizes authority with the Governor of The Panama Canal.",
