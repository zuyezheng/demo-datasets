    "critique": "This executive order establishes an advisory council to strengthen ties between the U.S. government and the African Diaspora. It focuses on promoting equity, opportunity, and cultural/economic ties. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or economic regulation in a significant way. It leans towards social inclusion and has a moderate liberal tilt due to its focus on equity and diversity.",
