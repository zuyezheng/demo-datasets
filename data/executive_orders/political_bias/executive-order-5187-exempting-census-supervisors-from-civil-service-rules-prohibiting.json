    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1929 that allows state and county officers to also serve as supervisors for the Census. This appears to be for practical reasons related to the census. There's no strong ideological tilt, immigration component, or focus on national security vs. civil liberties. It has a slight federalism lean as it involves the federal government using state officers. It also has a slight deregulation lean as it removes a restriction on who can be a supervisor. Finally, it is neutral on social inclusion.",
