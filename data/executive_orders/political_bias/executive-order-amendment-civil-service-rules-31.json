It clarifies that the amendments made in 1894 were not intended to be retroactive. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power dynamics, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects in this document. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
