    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the internal regulations of the Foreign Service, dictating how its officers should handle correspondence, reports, and mail. It outlines the scope of official communication, duties related to correspondence, and procedures for handling both official and unofficial mail. The document also cancels and revokes several older regulations and executive orders. Given its focus on internal administrative procedures, the document does not directly address issues related to ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
