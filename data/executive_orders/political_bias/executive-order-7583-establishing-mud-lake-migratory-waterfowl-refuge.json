It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The action is taken by the president, but it is pursuant to an existing act, so it doesn't necessarily expand executive power significantly.",
