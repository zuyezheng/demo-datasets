It revokes a previous order and temporarily withdraws certain lands in Colorado for use by the Department of Agriculture for soil erosion control and other land utilization activities. There is a provision that allows for mineral resource development. The order does not explicitly address social issues, immigration, or civil liberties. Therefore, most of the scores are neutral.",
