    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the inspection of tax returns by U.S. attorneys and attorneys of the Department of Justice. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that allowing the Department of Justice greater access to tax returns expands executive power, but it is primarily an administrative action. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
