    "critique": "This executive order primarily amends the Manual for Courts-Martial, focusing on procedural updates and the introduction of new offenses. The most significant changes involve allowing remote testimony in certain circumstances and adding offenses related to the death or injury of an unborn child and stalking. The remote testimony provisions could be seen as a way to streamline legal proceedings and reduce costs, but also potentially impacting the defendant's right to confront witnesses. The addition of offenses related to unborn children reflects a conservative viewpoint on the legal status of a fetus. The inclusion of stalking as an offense broadens the scope of punishable conduct. Overall, the order seems to have a slight conservative tilt due to the unborn child provision, while also aiming for procedural efficiency.",
