    "critique": "This document primarily concerns a historical event, the raising of the U.S. flag over Fort Sumter after the Civil War. It doesn't directly address contemporary political issues. Therefore, most axes will be close to neutral. The social inclusion aspect might lean slightly towards conformity, as it celebrates a unified national identity after a period of division, but it's not a strong emphasis.",
