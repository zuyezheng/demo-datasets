    "critique": "This document is a formal announcement of the death of James G. Blaine and directs actions to honor him. It is unlikely to have strong political implications. Most scores should be neutral. The announcement does not contain information related to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is also neutral as it is a statement of respect for a public figure.",
