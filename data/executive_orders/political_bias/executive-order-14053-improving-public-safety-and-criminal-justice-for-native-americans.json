    "critique": "This executive order focuses on addressing violence against Native Americans and missing or murdered indigenous people. It directs various federal agencies to coordinate and strengthen law enforcement efforts, improve data collection, and enhance prevention and victim services. The order emphasizes consultation with Tribal Nations and community-based organizations. It does not directly address immigration, economic regulation, or expand executive power significantly. It promotes social inclusion and aims to improve the safety and well-being of Native Americans.",
