    "critique": "This executive order reduces the size of the White Mountain Indian Reservation in Arizona Territory, restoring the land to the public domain. This action has implications for several of the political bias axes. Ideologically, it reflects a conservative approach by prioritizing westward expansion and resource access over indigenous land rights. Regarding immigration, while not directly related, the reduction of reservation land could indirectly impact indigenous populations and their relationship with the broader society. In terms of federalism, the order demonstrates federal control over territory and Native American affairs, overriding potential state or tribal interests. Concerning social inclusion, the action leans towards conformity by diminishing the land available for a specific cultural group. There is no direct impact on executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation based on the text provided.",
