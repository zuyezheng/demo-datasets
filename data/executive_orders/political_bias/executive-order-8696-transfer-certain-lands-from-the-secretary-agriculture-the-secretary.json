    "critique": "This document pertains to the transfer of jurisdiction over lands acquired by the United States in New Mexico from the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the Interior, to be administered for the use of Pueblo Indians. It is based on the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion of executive power, or impact on national security vs. civil liberties. It seems to shift power slightly towards the federal government, and it promotes social inclusion by designating the land for the use of Pueblo Indians. There's no direct economic regulation involved, but the underlying act suggests some government intervention in agriculture.",
