    "critique": "The document primarily concerns the composition of local boards within the Selective Service System, specifically focusing on residency, military affiliation, and age requirements for board members. It does not directly address topics such as immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes would be neutral. The change to include 'male or female' could be interpreted as a slight move towards social inclusion.",
