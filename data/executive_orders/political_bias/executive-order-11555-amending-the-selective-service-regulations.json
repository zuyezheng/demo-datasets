    "critique": "This document amends Selective Service Regulations to allow women to serve on local boards. This suggests a move towards social inclusion. The document does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or economic regulation. The change to include women on local boards can be seen as a slight move towards the liberal side of the spectrum.",
