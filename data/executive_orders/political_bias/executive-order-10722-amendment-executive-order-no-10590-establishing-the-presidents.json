    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous order regarding the President's Committee on Government Employment Policy. It adjusts the composition of the committee. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration. It seems neutral on executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, and economic regulation. It could be argued that ensuring representation from various departments promotes a form of social inclusion, but it's very mild.",
