    "critique": "This document primarily concerns amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial. It doesn't directly address issues related to immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The changes are procedural and focused on military justice. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The executive power axis is slightly positive as it's an executive order making changes, but it's within the scope of the President's authority regarding the military.",
