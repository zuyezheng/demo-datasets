    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to investigate the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It's difficult to assign a strong ideological tilt as it addresses a public health crisis. Immigration is not directly addressed. Executive power is somewhat expanded through the creation of the commission, but it's a temporary body. Federalism is neutral as it involves both federal and state officials. National security vs. civil liberties is balanced, with a focus on public health. Economic regulation is neutral. Social inclusion is slightly positive as it addresses a disease that disproportionately affected marginalized communities at the time.",
