    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the extension of limits for specific customs ports of entry in North Dakota, Minnesota, and Washington. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration policies, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only possible exception might be federalism, where extending the reach of federal customs districts could be seen as a slight increase in federal power, but this is a very minor effect.",
