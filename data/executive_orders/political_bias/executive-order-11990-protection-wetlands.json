    "critique": "This executive order focuses on environmental protection, specifically the preservation of wetlands. It directs federal agencies to minimize the destruction of wetlands in their activities and to avoid supporting new construction in wetlands where alternatives exist. It promotes public review of construction plans and restricts the disposal of federally-owned wetlands. The order emphasizes factors like public health, safety, and the maintenance of natural systems. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight lean towards liberal due to the environmental focus and a slight lean towards government intervention due to the regulation of land use.",
