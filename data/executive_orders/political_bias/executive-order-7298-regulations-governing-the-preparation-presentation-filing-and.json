    "critique": "This document is an executive order that outlines the process for preparing, presenting, filing, and distributing executive orders and proclamations. It focuses on standardization, formatting, and legal review. There is nothing about immigration, civil liberties, the economy, or social issues. It seems mostly procedural. Therefore, most of the axes should be neutral. The only possible exception is executive power, which could be seen as slightly expanding it by standardizing the process.",
