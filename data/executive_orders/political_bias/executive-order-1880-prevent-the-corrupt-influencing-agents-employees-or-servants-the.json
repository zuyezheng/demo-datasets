    "critique": "This executive order focuses on preventing bribery and corruption within the Canal Zone. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Its primary focus is on economic regulation by preventing corruption. Therefore, most axes should be neutral, with a slight lean towards economic regulation.",
