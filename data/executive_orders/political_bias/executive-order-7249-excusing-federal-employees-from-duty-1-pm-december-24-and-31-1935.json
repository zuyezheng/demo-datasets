    "critique": "This executive order pertains to closing government offices early on the days preceding Christmas and New Year's Day in 1935. It applies to federal employees in the District of Columbia and the field service, with exceptions for those needed for public reasons or whose absence would violate existing law. The order also addresses employees working in shifts, excusing them after four hours of work on the specified dates. Given the subject matter, the document has minimal implications for most of the axes. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is also neutral, as granting government employees time off for holidays is not inherently liberal or conservative. Therefore, most scores should be around 0.",
