    "critique": "This executive order establishes an interagency group on insular areas. It seems primarily focused on internal management and coordination within the federal government. There's no indication of a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It doesn't significantly expand executive power or alter the balance of federalism. The order doesn't directly address economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
