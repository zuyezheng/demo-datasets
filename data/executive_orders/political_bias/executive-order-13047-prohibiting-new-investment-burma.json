    "critique": "The document expresses concern over human rights and democratic opposition in Burma, which aligns with liberal values. It imposes economic sanctions, demonstrating a willingness to intervene in international affairs to promote these values. However, it also expands executive power by declaring a national emergency and delegating authority to the Secretary of Treasury, which could be seen as a conservative approach.",
