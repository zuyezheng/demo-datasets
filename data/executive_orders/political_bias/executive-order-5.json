    "critique": "This document is a waiver for a specific individual's transfer between government departments. It doesn't touch on broad ideological themes, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards expanding executive power, as it's a specific waiver granted by an executive, but this is very minor.",
