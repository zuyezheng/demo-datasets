    "critique": "This executive order concerns land allocation involving Native American tribes in the Dakota Territory in 1884. Given the historical context, the order likely reduces the land allocated to the Turtle Mountain band of Chippewa Indians, restoring it to the public domain. This action reflects a bias towards westward expansion and potentially disregards the rights and needs of the Native American population. Therefore, it leans conservative in the sense of prioritizing settlement and development over indigenous land rights. Immigration is not directly addressed, but the action facilitates settlement. Executive power is being exercised to alter land allocations. Federalism is implicated as the federal government is making decisions about land within a territory. National security vs. civil liberties is not a primary concern here, but the decision impacts the civil liberties of the tribe. Economic regulation is not directly involved, but the land allocation has economic implications. Social inclusion is negatively impacted as the order reduces land for a minority group.",
