    "critique": "This executive order establishes a uniform system for classifying, declassifying, and safeguarding national security information. It balances the public's right to information with the need to protect national security. The order defines classification levels, authorities, and categories, and sets limitations on classification. It also addresses declassification, safeguarding, and implementation. The order seems relatively neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, economic regulation, and social inclusion. However, it leans towards expanding executive power and prioritizing national security over civil liberties.\n\nIdeological Tilt: The order doesn't directly address traditional left-right political issues, so it's close to neutral.\nImmigration Approach: The order doesn't deal with immigration policies.\nExecutive Power: The order vests significant authority in the President and agency heads to classify and declassify information, potentially expanding executive power.\nFederalism: The order doesn't significantly shift power between the federal government and the states.\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The order prioritizes national security by restricting access to classified information.\nEconomic Regulation: The order doesn't address economic regulation.\nSocial Inclusion: The order doesn't address social inclusion issues.\n\nRevised Scores:\nIdeological Tilt: 0\nImmigration Approach: 0\nExecutive Power: 2\nFederalism: 0\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: 3\nEconomic Regulation: 0\nSocial Inclusion: 0",
