    "critique": "This executive order withdraws public lands for use as a practice bombing range by the War Department. It was issued shortly after the US entered World War II. \n\nIdeological Tilt: This is difficult to assess. It's a wartime measure, so doesn't neatly fit on a left-right spectrum. I'll put it at 0.\nImmigration Approach: This order has nothing to do with immigration, so it's 0.\nExecutive Power: It expands executive power by withdrawing public lands. I'll score it +2.\nFederalism: This is a federal action, so it leans towards federal control. I'll score it +1.\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: This prioritizes national security during wartime. I'll score it +3.\nEconomic Regulation: This has minimal economic impact, so I'll score it 0.\nSocial Inclusion: This has no impact on social inclusion, so I'll score it 0.",
