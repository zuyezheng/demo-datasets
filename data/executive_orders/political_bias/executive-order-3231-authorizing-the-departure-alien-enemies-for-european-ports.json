    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1920 amending a previous order related to passport and departure permits for alien enemies. It relaxes the requirements for departure, specifically removing the need for a permit from the US government for alien enemies departing to European ports, provided they have a valid passport and a certificate of compliance with income tax law. This suggests a slight shift towards less restrictive policies during that time.",
