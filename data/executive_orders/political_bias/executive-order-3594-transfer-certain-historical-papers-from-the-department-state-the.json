    "critique": "This executive order primarily concerns the transfer of historical documents from the Department of State to the Library of Congress. It doesn't directly address typical political issues such as economic regulation, immigration, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The transfer itself could be seen as a slight shift towards federal control over historical archives, but it's a minor adjustment. There's no indication of changes to executive power or impacts on national security vs. civil liberties. The ideological tilt is negligible, as the action is about preservation and accessibility rather than promoting a specific political agenda.",
