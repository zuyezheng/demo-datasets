    "critique": "This document is an executive order extending diplomatic privileges and immunities to the European Communities' missions in the US. It doesn't directly address typical left-right ideological issues, immigration policies, or economic regulations. It could be argued that extending privileges expands executive power, but it's more about facilitating international relations. Federalism isn't really impacted, nor is national security vs. civil liberties in a significant way. Social inclusion isn't a primary focus either. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
