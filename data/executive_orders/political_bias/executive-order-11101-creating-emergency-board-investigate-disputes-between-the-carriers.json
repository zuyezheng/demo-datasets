    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a labor dispute in the railway industry, preventing changes to the conditions out of which the disputes arose for a limited time. It seems to be a fairly neutral intervention to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. There's no clear ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on social inclusion. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by creating the board, but it's within the bounds of the Railway Labor Act. It also leans slightly towards federalism by intervening in what could be seen as a state matter. It has a slight intervention in economic regulation by preventing changes to the conditions out of which the disputes arose.",
