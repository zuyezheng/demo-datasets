    "critique": "The document establishes exemptions to existing labor codes for apprentices under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It leans towards government intervention in the economy by setting up a framework for apprentice wages and training programs, while also expanding executive power through the President's order and the Secretary of Labor's authority to create further regulations. The order also centralizes authority at the federal level through the involvement of federal agencies.",
