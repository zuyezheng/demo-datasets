    "critique": "This document is an executive order by Franklin D. Roosevelt regarding apprenticeships under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It allows for apprentices to be employed at lower wages and for longer hours than stipulated in existing codes, provided they are part of an approved training program. The order establishes a committee under the Secretary of Labor to oversee these programs. It seems to be an interventionist economic policy, allowing some flexibility within the existing regulatory framework of the NIRA. There's no direct impact on immigration, civil liberties, or federalism. It does not directly address social inclusion or ideological tilt. The order expands the power of the executive branch, specifically the Secretary of Labor, in implementing and overseeing these apprenticeship programs.",
