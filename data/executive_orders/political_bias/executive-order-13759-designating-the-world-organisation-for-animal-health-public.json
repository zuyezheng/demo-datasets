    "critique": "This executive order designates the World Organisation for Animal Health as a public international organization, entitling it to certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities under the International Organizations Immunities Act. It includes standard clauses ensuring it doesn't infringe on existing authorities or create new enforceable rights. There is no clear ideological tilt. It does not relate to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
