    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's Council on Aging. It seems to be a fairly moderate and centrist initiative. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any significant way. The order itself doesn't seem to lean heavily in any particular ideological direction, focusing on coordinating government efforts to address the needs of the aging population. Therefore, most scores will be near zero.",
