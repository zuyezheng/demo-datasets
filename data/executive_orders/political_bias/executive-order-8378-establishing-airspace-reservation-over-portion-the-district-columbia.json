    "critique": "This document establishes an airspace reservation over a portion of the District of Columbia for national defense, governmental purposes, and public safety. It restricts civil aircraft navigation within this area without special permission. There is nothing explicitly ideological in this document. It does not address immigration, so it is neutral on that axis. It could be argued that restricting airspace expands executive power, but it is also for public safety. It does not obviously shift power between the federal and state governments. It prioritizes national security and public safety by restricting airspace. It does not directly regulate the economy. It does not address social inclusion or diversity. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
