    "critique": "The document concerns infrastructure spending in Puerto Rico in 1900. Given the time period, it is unlikely to focus on social inclusion or civil liberties. The act of allocating funds for infrastructure could be seen as a moderate level of government intervention. Since Puerto Rico was a US territory at the time, the federal government would have had control.",
