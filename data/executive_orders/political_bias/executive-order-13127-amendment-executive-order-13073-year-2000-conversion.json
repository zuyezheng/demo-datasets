It centralizes authority under the Chair of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, expanding executive power to coordinate responses and manage information sharing. The order emphasizes federal coordination and agency assessments, indicating a move towards stronger federal control. There is a focus on security and recovery of critical systems, potentially at the expense of individual liberties in an emergency. The document does not directly address economic regulation, immigration, or social inclusion.",
