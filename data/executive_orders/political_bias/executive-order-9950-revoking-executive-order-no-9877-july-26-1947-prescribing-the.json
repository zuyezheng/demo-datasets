    "critique": "This document revokes a previous executive order that assigned functions to the armed services. It's a simple change in administrative organization. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, impact on civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does shift power slightly, giving the current executive more flexibility in assigning roles, but it's not a major expansion. It also doesn't obviously favor federal or state control.",
