    "critique": "This executive order from 1936 reallocates funds from one category to another within the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act. It increases funding for rural rehabilitation, loans, and relief to farmers and livestock growers by transferring funds from other public project categories. This suggests a focus on economic intervention and support for a specific group (farmers). There's no direct impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt leans slightly liberal due to the government intervention in the economy and support for specific groups.",
