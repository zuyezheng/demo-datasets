    "critique": "This executive order from 1962 directs the Postmaster General to assist in developing a national emergency registration system in preparation for a national emergency, including an attack on the United States. It emphasizes cooperation with the Department of Defense and outlines specific tasks such as planning a registration system, training postal employees, and assessing damage to postal services. The order also stresses interagency cooperation and presidential coordination through the Office of Emergency Planning. It explicitly reserves the authority to implement emergency plans to the President and allows the Postmaster General to redelegate assigned functions. Given the historical context of the Cold War, the order reflects a focus on national security and preparedness. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, or social inclusion. The order seems to expand executive power by centralizing emergency planning under the President's direction and federalism by tasking a federal entity to create a national program. It also leans towards prioritizing national security over civil liberties in the context of a potential attack.",
