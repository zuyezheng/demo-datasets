    "critique": "The document outlines the Postmaster General's role in developing a national emergency registration system, focusing on civil defense and family reunification during national emergencies. It emphasizes cooperation with the Department of Defense and other agencies, while reserving ultimate authority for the President. There is no explicit mention of immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document leans towards expanding executive power in times of emergency and prioritizing security measures.",
