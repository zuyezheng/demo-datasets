    "critique": "This executive order establishes the White House Conference for a Drug Free America. It aims to bring together experts to combat drug abuse through education, prevention, and treatment. It also seeks to formulate a national strategy and highlight the role of parents and families. The order itself doesn't directly address immigration, so that axis should be neutral. It expands executive power by creating a new body within the Executive Office of the President and giving the President appointment powers. It centralizes authority at the federal level. It emphasizes law enforcement and prevention, which could be seen as leaning towards national security. It could be seen as interventionist in addressing drug abuse. It promotes a traditional view of discouraging drug use, which could be seen as leaning towards conformity. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: -2, Immigration Approach: 0, Executive Power: 2, Federalism: 2, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 1, Economic Regulation: 1, Social Inclusion: -1. After further consideration, the ideological tilt is more moderate, as it focuses on a specific issue rather than broad ideological principles. The emphasis on law enforcement and prevention is balanced by the focus on treatment and education, so the national security vs. civil liberties axis should be more neutral. The final scores are: Ideological Tilt: -1, Immigration Approach: 0, Executive Power: 2, Federalism: 2, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0, Economic Regulation: 1, Social Inclusion: -1.",
