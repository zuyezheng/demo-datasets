    "critique": "This document establishes the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico. It withdraws public lands from settlement and reserves them for the Department of the Interior for wildlife conservation. It also includes provisions to ensure the continued use of some lands for range research by the Department of Agriculture and subjects the reservation to the terms of the Grazing District Act. The executive order itself doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, or civil liberties. It has a slight tilt towards federalism as it centralizes land management under federal agencies. It also has a slight tilt towards economic intervention as it withdraws land from potential economic activities like settlement and sale. It promotes social inclusion by preserving natural wildlife resources.",
