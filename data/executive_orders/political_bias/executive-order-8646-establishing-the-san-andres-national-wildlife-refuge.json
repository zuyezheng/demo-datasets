    "critique": "The document establishes the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico, withdrawing public lands for conservation and wildlife development. It balances the interests of different departments (Interior and Agriculture) and existing grazing rights. There is no direct discussion of immigration, executive power, or social issues. Therefore, most axes are neutral, with a slight lean towards federal control due to the federal government establishing the refuge.",
