    "critique": "The document centralizes power in the federal government, specifically the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), to ensure consistent application of merit system principles across federal agencies. It expands the ability of the executive branch to collect workforce information and review agency personnel management programs. This suggests a move towards greater federal oversight and standardization of human resources practices.",
