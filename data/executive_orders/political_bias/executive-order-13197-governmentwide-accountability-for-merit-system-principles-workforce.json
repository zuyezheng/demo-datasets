    "critique": "This executive order focuses on ensuring consistent application of merit system principles and establishing accountability in federal human resources management. It emphasizes data collection and OPM oversight. There's no strong indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, or direct impact on civil liberties. It centralizes authority by giving OPM more power, and has a moderate interventionist approach by mandating accountability systems.",
