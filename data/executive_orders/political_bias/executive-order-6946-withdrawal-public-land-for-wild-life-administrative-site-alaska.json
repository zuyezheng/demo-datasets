    "critique": "The document describes the temporary withdrawal of public land in Alaska for the joint use of the Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Biological Survey, and the Alaska Game Commission. This suggests a moderate level of government intervention for conservation purposes. There is no information available about immigration, executive power, security vs liberty, or social inclusion. The document seems to favor federal control over state control.",
