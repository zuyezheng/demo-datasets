    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1935 that withdraws public land in Alaska for the joint use of the Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Biological Survey, and the Alaska Game Commission. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It is related to land management and conservation. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the axes should be scored as neutral.",
