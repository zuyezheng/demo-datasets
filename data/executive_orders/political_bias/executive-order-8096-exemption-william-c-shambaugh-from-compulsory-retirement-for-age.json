    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts William C. Shambaugh from compulsory retirement for age for one year. It is a very specific action pertaining to one individual. There is no clear indication of broad ideological leaning. It does not touch on immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The extension of employment could be seen as a very slight expansion of executive power, but it is minimal.",
