    "critique": "This document reorganizes existing regulations for diplomatic and consular officers into a single set of regulations called the \"Foreign Service Regulations of the United States.\" It does not appear to make substantive changes to policy, but rather consolidates existing instructions and regulations. Therefore, it has minimal impact on the axes of political bias. It does not obviously expand executive power, restrict immigration, favor one level of government over another, or touch on civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Given the lack of substantive policy changes, the scores should be close to neutral.",
