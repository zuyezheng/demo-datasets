    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that withdraws public lands in California from settlement for use as a fire-lookout site and for classification in aid of legislation. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The federal government is exercising its power over land, which could be seen as a slight increase in federal power.",
