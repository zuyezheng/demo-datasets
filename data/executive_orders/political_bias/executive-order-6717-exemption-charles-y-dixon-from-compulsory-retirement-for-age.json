    "critique": "This is an executive order that makes an exception to a rule about retirement age for a government employee. It is a very specific action, and it is difficult to assign broad political meaning to it. The order itself does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It is neither particularly open nor closed on immigration. It uses executive power to make an exception, but it does not necessarily expand executive power in a general sense. It does not obviously relate to federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral.",
