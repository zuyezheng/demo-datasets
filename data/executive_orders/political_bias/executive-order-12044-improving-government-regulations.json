    "critique": "This executive order aims to improve the quality of executive agency regulatory practices by making regulations simpler, clearer, and more efficient. It emphasizes minimizing burdens on the economy, individuals, and state/local governments. The order promotes public participation, consideration of alternatives, and regulatory analysis. It also calls for review of existing regulations to ensure they meet policy goals. The order seems to lean towards deregulation and reducing government intervention in the economy. It also emphasizes transparency and public input, which could be seen as promoting civil liberties. However, it also grants the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) significant oversight power, which could be seen as expanding executive power. It does not directly address immigration or social inclusion. It also does not seem to shift power between state and federal governments. Therefore, I will score it accordingly.",
