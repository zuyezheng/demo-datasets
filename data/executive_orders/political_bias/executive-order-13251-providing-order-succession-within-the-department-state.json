    "critique": "This document establishes the order of succession for the Secretary of State. It is primarily an administrative action. It does not directly address issues related to ideological tilt, immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does not expand executive power, but rather clarifies the line of succession within existing legal frameworks. It does not directly impact federalism or national security vs. civil liberties. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
