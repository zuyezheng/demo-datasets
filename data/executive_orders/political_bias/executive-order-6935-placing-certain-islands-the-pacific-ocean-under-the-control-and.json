    "critique": "This executive order from 1934 designates Wake Island, Kingman Reef, and Johnston and Sand Islands under the control of the Secretary of the Navy for administrative purposes, while also allowing the Department of Agriculture to use Johnston and Sand Islands as a refuge and breeding ground for native birds. The order itself doesn't express a clear ideological tilt. It's primarily an administrative action. There's no direct impact on immigration. It could be argued that placing these islands under the control of the Secretary of the Navy expands executive power, but it's a relatively minor expansion for administrative purposes. The order doesn't explicitly address federalism, but it implies a federal role in managing these territories. There's no direct mention of national security or civil liberties. The order doesn't directly regulate the economy. It doesn't directly address social inclusion, focusing instead on administrative control and conservation. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
