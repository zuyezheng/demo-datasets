    "critique": "This document establishes rules of precedence among various US government officials, primarily within diplomatic and military contexts. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document seems purely administrative.",
