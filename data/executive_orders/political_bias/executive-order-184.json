    "critique": "This document pertains to military procedure and reporting when different corps of the army, Marine Corps, or militia are joined for duty. It mandates that an officer commanding such a combined force report to both the Secretary of War and their own superiors. The document appears neutral regarding ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, economic regulation, and social inclusion. It has a slight emphasis on national security through military coordination, but not at the expense of civil liberties.",
