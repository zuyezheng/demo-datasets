    "critique": "The document is an executive order from President Franklin D. Roosevelt establishing the St. Lawrence Advisory Committee to investigate and develop navigation and hydroelectric power in the St. Lawrence River. It grants significant authority to federal agencies (Federal Power Commission and Corps of Engineers) and allows them to bypass civil service laws in hiring. The order is justified by national security and defense concerns during World War II.",
