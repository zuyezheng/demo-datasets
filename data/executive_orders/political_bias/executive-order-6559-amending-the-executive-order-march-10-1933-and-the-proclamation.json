    "critique": "This executive order from 1934 amends previous orders related to banking operations and foreign exchange transactions. It removes certain restrictions on these transactions that were put in place earlier. It's important to consider this within the context of the Great Depression and FDR's efforts to stabilize the economy. Ideologically, it reflects a moderate interventionist approach to the economy, which was characteristic of the New Deal. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. The removal of restrictions could be seen as a slight deregulation, but it's more about adjusting existing regulations than a complete shift to laissez-faire. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
