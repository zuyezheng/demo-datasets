    "critique": "The document extends restrictions on land alienation for Native Americans, which suggests a paternalistic approach. However, it also lists specific exceptions, indicating some level of individual consideration. The document does not explicitly address economic regulation, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or social inclusion in a direct way. Therefore, most scores are neutral, with a slight lean towards conformity due to the restrictive nature of the land policy.",
