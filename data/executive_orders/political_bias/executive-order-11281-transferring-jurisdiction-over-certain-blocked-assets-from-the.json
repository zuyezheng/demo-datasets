    "critique": "This executive order primarily concerns the transfer of administrative responsibilities related to blocked assets of certain foreign countries from the Attorney General to the Secretary of the Treasury. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or social inclusion. It maintains existing blocking controls related to national emergencies. The order seems neutral in terms of expanding executive power, as it simply reassigns existing authority. It also doesn't significantly impact federalism or civil liberties. The economic regulation aspect is moderate, as it deals with existing blocked assets but doesn't introduce new regulations. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
