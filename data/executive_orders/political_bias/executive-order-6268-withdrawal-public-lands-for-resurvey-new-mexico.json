    "critique": "This document is a withdrawal of public lands from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation, pending a resurvey. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The act itself does not expand executive power, but the order being issued by the executive branch suggests a slight expansion.",
