It doesn't directly address broad ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. The order seems primarily focused on internal administrative procedures and career advancement opportunities for a specific group of employees. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
