    "critique": "This document is an amendment to a previous executive order, dealing with the authority to prescribe regulations regarding travel expenses for government personnel. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The amendment itself seems technical and administrative.",
