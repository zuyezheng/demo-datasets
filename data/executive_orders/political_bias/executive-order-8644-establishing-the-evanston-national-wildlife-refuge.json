    "critique": "This document establishes a wildlife refuge in Wyoming. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It does not address immigration. It expands executive power by setting aside land for a refuge. It involves the federal government in land management, indicating federal primacy. It balances national security and civil liberties by protecting wildlife. It could be seen as a form of economic regulation, but it is minimal. It promotes social inclusion by protecting wildlife.",
