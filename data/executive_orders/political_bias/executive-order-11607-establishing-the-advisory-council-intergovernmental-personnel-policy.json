    "critique": "This executive order establishes an advisory council to improve the quality of public service at the state and local levels. It aims to strengthen the capacity of state and local governments and facilitate temporary assignments of personnel between the federal government and state/local entities. The order emphasizes merit principles and encourages the development of comprehensive systems of personnel administration. There is a slight tilt towards federal involvement in state and local affairs, but it's primarily focused on cooperation and assistance. The order doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes should be neutral. The ideological tilt is also neutral as it focuses on improving public administration rather than promoting a specific political agenda.",
