    "critique": "This document pertains to an amendment regarding employment rules within the Department of Agriculture. It outlines exceptions to standard hiring practices, particularly for scientific or professional experts. The focus is on ensuring qualifications through Civil Service Commission certification for reappointments, while also specifying limitations on the scope and location of these exceptions. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes will be neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly conservative due to the emphasis on qualification and limitations on employment.",
