    "critique": "The document establishes protections for employees who report violations of fair competition codes, signaling a focus on economic regulation and worker protection. There is no direct discussion of immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or social inclusion, so these aspects are assessed as neutral. The document seems to be coming from a place of moderate regulation, and doesn't seem to lean heavily on any of the other axes.",
