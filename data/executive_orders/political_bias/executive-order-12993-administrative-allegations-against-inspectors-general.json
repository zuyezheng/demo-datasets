    "critique": "This executive order establishes an Integrity Committee to investigate allegations of wrongdoing against Inspectors General and certain staff members of the Offices of Inspectors General. It aims to ensure that such allegations are appropriately and expeditiously investigated and resolved. The order outlines the composition of the Integrity Committee, the referral process for allegations, the authority to investigate, the reporting of investigation results, and procedures for handling allegations. It also specifies that the order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any enforceable right or benefit. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It seems to have a neutral impact on federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, and social inclusion. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by creating a new committee and process, but it also adds a layer of oversight, so it's a mixed bag. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration Approach: 0, Executive Power: 1, Federalism: 0, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0, Economic Regulation: 0, Social Inclusion: 0. Upon further reflection, the expansion of executive power is minimal, as it primarily establishes a committee for internal oversight. Therefore, I will revise the score for Executive Power to 0.",
