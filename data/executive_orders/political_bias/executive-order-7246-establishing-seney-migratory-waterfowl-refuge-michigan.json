    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Seney Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in Michigan. It sets aside land for the Department of Agriculture to use as a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife. The order also amends a previous order to exclude the newly designated refuge area. There is little to no indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power implications, or impacts on national security vs. civil liberties. The order does shift control of the land to the federal government, indicating a federalism score. It also involves government intervention in land management, suggesting an economic regulation score. There is no clear indication of social inclusion implications.",
