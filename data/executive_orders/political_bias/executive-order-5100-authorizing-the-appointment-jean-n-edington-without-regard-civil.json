    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1929 that waives civil service rules to allow Mrs. Jean N. Edington to be appointed to a position in the classified service. The rationale is based on her being the sole provider for her children due to her husband's illness. There is no clear ideological tilt. The document does not address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a broad sense. It is a specific exception for an individual case. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
