    "critique": "This document is a land order related to Alaska. It describes the boundaries of land tracts being excluded from the Tongass National Forest and restored to entry under public-land laws. It primarily deals with land management and property rights. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, executive power dynamics, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
