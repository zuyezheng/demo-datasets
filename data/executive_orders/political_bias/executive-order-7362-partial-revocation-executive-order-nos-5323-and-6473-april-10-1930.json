    "critique": "This document concerns the revocation of previous executive orders withdrawing public lands in Wyoming pending a resurvey. It seems to be a technical correction related to land management. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
