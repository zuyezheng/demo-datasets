    "critique": "The document is an executive order that exempts Willard Deason, Commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission, from mandatory retirement until December 31, 1975. This is a fairly narrow action. There is no clear ideological tilt. It does not obviously relate to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores should be neutral.",
