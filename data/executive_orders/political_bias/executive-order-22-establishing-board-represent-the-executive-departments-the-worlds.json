    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1884 concerning the World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exhibition. It directs executive departments to prepare and exhibit articles and materials that illustrate the functions and administrative faculties of the government. It establishes a board to manage the arrangement and safe-keeping of these items. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any significant way. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
