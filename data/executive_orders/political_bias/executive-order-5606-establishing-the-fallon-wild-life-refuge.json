    "critique": "This document establishes a wildlife refuge. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Its primary focus is environmental conservation. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly towards conservation, which can be seen as a liberal value, but not strongly so.",
