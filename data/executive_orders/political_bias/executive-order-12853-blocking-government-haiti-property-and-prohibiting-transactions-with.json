    "critique": "This executive order, issued by President Clinton in 1993, addresses the situation in Haiti following United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 841. It blocks assets of the Haitian government and the de facto regime, prohibits certain transactions with them, and restricts the export of specific goods to Haiti under certain conditions. The order invokes the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the United Nations Participation Act. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion within the US. It focuses on economic sanctions and foreign policy. It could be argued that freezing assets and restricting trade represents government intervention in the economy, but this is in the context of foreign policy and national security. The order expands executive power to implement these sanctions.",
