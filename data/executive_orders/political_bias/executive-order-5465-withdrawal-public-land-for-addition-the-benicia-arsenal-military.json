    "critique": "This document is a straightforward land withdrawal for military purposes. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, or civil liberties. Federalism is implicated as the federal government is taking control of land within a state, but it's a routine action. There's no economic regulation or social inclusion aspect. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards federal control.",
