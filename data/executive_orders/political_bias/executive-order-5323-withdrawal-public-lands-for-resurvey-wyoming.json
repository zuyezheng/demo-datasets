    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order from 1930, signed by the President. It withdraws public lands in Wyoming from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. This seems to be a fairly routine administrative action related to land management. It's difficult to discern a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any significant way. Therefore, most of the axes should be close to neutral.",
