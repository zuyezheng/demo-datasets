    "critique": "This document pertains to the designation of an acting judge for the U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico in 1936. Given the limited scope and administrative nature, the document has minimal ideological implications. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document itself doesn't expand executive power, it just executes existing law.",
