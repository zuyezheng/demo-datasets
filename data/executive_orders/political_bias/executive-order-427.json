    "critique": "The document establishes the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, transferring control of abandoned lands and related funds/records from military and Treasury officers to the Bureau. This centralizes power in the Bureau, a federal entity, to manage resources and support refugees and freedmen. The order emphasizes federal control over state control, expands executive power, leans towards social inclusion, and involves government intervention.",
