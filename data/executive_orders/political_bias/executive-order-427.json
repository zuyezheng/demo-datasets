    "critique": "This document establishes the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands. Ideologically, this seems liberal as it helps freedmen. It has a neutral stance on immigration. It expands executive power as it orders officers to turn over lands and property. It centralizes power in the federal government. It focuses on civil liberties by helping freedmen. It intervenes in the economy by managing abandoned lands. It emphasizes diversity by helping refugees and freedmen.",
