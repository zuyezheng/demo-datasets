    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the selection process for postmasters in first, second, and third-class post offices. It mandates open competitive examinations administered by the Civil Service Commission to fill vacancies, ensuring appointments are made from the top three qualified candidates. The order emphasizes business training, experience, and executive ability as key qualifications, moving away from purely academic assessments. It also includes a residency requirement and age limit for applicants. The accompanying statement clarifies that this order aims to extend civil service principles to postmaster positions, which are considered business agencies of the government. It acknowledges the need for congressional action to fully classify these positions but takes a step in that direction by requiring competitive examinations for appointments. The order applies to both current and future postmaster vacancies as their terms expire.",
