It does not touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that is relevant is executive power, and this order has a neutral impact as it simply clarifies who can perform the duties of the Secretary of Commerce in specific circumstances.",
