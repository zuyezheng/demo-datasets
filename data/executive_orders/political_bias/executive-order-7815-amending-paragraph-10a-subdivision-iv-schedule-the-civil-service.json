    "critique": "This executive order pertains to civil service rules at West Point. It specifically amends Schedule A to include the position of chapel organist and choirmaster in the classified civil service. This action seems neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. The order's primary effect is on the internal administration of West Point.",
