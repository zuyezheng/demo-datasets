    "critique": "This document establishes a commission to investigate the Pearl Harbor attack. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It expands executive power by creating the commission and directing other agencies to cooperate. It centralizes authority at the federal level. It prioritizes national security by investigating potential derelictions of duty. It doesn't directly address social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:\n\nIdeological Tilt: 0\nImmigration Approach: 0\nExecutive Power: 3\nFederalism: 3\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: 3\nEconomic Regulation: 0\nSocial Inclusion: 0\n\nUpon further reflection, the expansion of executive power is moderate, as it is a temporary commission with a specific purpose. The federalism aspect is also moderate, as it is related to a specific event and investigation. The national security focus is clear but not extreme.\n",
