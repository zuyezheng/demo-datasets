    "critique": "This document is a routine executive order regarding the line of succession within the Department of Agriculture. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis it relates to is executive power, and even then, it's a very minor and neutral adjustment. Therefore, all scores should be 0 except for a potentially very slight adjustment to executive power, which I will also leave at 0 for being immaterial.",
