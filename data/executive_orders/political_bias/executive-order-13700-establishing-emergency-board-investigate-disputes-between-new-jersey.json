    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate disputes between New Jersey Transit Rail and certain of its employees. It is a fairly procedural action, invoking the Railway Labor Act. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on social inclusion. The executive power is used to create the board as required by law, so it's a neutral action. Federalism isn't strongly affected, nor is national security vs. civil liberties. Economic regulation is indirectly touched upon through labor relations, but not significantly. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
