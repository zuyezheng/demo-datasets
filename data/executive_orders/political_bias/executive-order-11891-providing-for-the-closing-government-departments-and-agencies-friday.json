It directs all Executive departments, independent establishments, and other governmental agencies to close, with exceptions for offices and installations deemed necessary for national security, defense, or other public reasons. Employees excused from duty on this day will still be compensated as per existing regulations. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 0.",
