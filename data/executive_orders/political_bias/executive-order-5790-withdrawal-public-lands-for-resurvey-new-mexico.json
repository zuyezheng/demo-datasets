    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order from 1932. It withdraws public lands in New Mexico from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. It cites the act of June 25, 1910, as amended by the act of August 24, 1912, as its authority. The order remains in effect until revoked by the President or Congress. There is little to no indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism concerns, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
