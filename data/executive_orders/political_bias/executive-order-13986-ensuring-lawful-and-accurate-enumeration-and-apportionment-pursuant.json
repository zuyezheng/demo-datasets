    "critique": "This document is an executive order that reverses a previous policy of excluding undocumented immigrants from the census count for apportionment purposes. It emphasizes the importance of including all residents in the census, regardless of immigration status, to ensure equal representation. It aligns with a liberal stance on immigration and social inclusion. It does not expand executive power, but rather reinforces existing constitutional and statutory requirements. It also doesn't seem to have a direct impact on economic regulation, federalism, or national security vs. civil liberties.",
