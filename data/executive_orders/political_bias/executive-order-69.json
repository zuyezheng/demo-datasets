    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding neutrality during the Russo-Japanese War. It emphasizes neutrality and avoiding actions that could irritate either combatant. It promotes a balanced approach to foreign relations and doesn't strongly lean towards any particular ideology. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
