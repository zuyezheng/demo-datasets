    "critique": "The document emphasizes neutrality and avoiding offense to foreign powers, suggesting a balanced approach to international relations. It doesn't strongly lean on any particular ideological tilt but promotes caution and non-intervention. The document does not explicitly address immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion, so those aspects are scored as neutral.",
