This action has minimal impact on the axes of political bias. It doesn't directly relate to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is neutral as it's a matter of international cooperation. Therefore, most scores should be around 0.",
