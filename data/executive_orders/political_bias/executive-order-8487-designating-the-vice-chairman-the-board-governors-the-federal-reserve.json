    "critique": "The document is an appointment of a Vice Chairman to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The appointment itself doesn't inherently expand executive power, as it's a standard procedure authorized by law. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only axis that might be slightly affected is economic regulation, as the Federal Reserve plays a role in economic policy, but the appointment itself doesn't dictate a specific regulatory stance.",
