    "critique": "This executive order, issued in 1934, establishes the Textile Labor Relations Board to address labor disputes and enforce fair competition within the textile industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It leans liberal due to its interventionist approach in labor relations and economic regulation. The order expands federal power by creating a federal board to oversee labor issues, thus increasing federal control. It also emphasizes social inclusion by addressing discrimination in hiring after strikes and ensuring collective bargaining rights. However, it doesn't directly address immigration or national security concerns. Therefore, the initial scores reflect these observations.",
