    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the accounting procedures and financial oversight of consular offices. It outlines how consular officers should manage and report fees, salaries, and expenses. There's a strong emphasis on accountability and preventing embezzlement. There is nothing about immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. The document does not seem to lean liberal or conservative.",
