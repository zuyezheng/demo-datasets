    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on financial accounting, reporting, and management within the consular services. There's a strong emphasis on preventing embezzlement and ensuring accurate record-keeping. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation in a broad sense, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be near neutral.",
