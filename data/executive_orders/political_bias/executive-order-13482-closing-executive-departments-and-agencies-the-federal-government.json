    "critique": "This executive order is a straightforward directive to close executive branch departments and agencies on December 26, 2008, granting employees a day off. It includes exceptions for national security, defense, or other public needs, as determined by department heads. The order also clarifies that existing statutes regarding pay and leave apply to this day off and explicitly states that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits. There is nothing about immigration, ideological tilt, federalism, security vs liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that this touches on is executive power, and it does so in a very limited way by allowing heads of agencies to determine exceptions.",
