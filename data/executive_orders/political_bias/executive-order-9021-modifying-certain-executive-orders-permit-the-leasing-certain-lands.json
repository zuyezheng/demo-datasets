    "critique": "This document pertains to the modification of previous executive orders to allow the leasing of public lands in Wyoming for use as a public airport. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on federalism, as it involves federal lands being leased, but this is a fairly standard practice. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
