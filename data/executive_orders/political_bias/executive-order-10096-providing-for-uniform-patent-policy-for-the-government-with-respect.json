    "critique": "This executive order establishes a uniform patent policy for the government regarding inventions made by government employees. It aims to balance government ownership of inventions made using government resources with the rights of government employees. It creates a Government Patents Board to oversee the policy and resolve disputes. The order seems primarily focused on efficient management of government-funded research and development and doesn't directly address issues related to the other axes. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
