    "critique": "This executive order terminates the War Refugee Board. This action in itself doesn't strongly indicate a position on any of the axes. The board was created to aid civilian victims of the Nazi regime, so ending it could be seen as slightly negative on social inclusion, but the war was ending and the board's purpose was presumably fulfilled. It doesn't seem to have a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, impact on executive power, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, or economic regulation effects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards conformity due to the termination of a program designed to aid refugees.",
