    "critique": "The document establishes a certificate of merit for civilians who aided the US during WWII. This seems fairly neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion. The executive power is slightly expanded as it creates a new award under the president's authority, but it's not a significant expansion.",
