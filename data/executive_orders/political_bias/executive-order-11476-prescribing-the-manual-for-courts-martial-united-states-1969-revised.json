    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the establishment and enforcement of military law. It does not directly address typical left-right ideological concerns, immigration, or economic regulation. It could be argued that it expands executive power insofar as the President is prescribing the manual, but this is a standard function. It has a slight impact on national security, but also needs to respect civil liberties. It does not directly impact federalism or social inclusion.",
