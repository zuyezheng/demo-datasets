    "critique": "This executive order is a straightforward directive to excuse federal employees from duty on December 24, 1962, the day before Christmas. It also encourages a liberal leave policy during the holiday period. There's nothing inherently ideological about this; it's a practical measure. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The encouragement of a liberal leave policy might suggest a slight lean towards valuing employee well-being, but it's not significant enough to warrant a strong liberal score.",
