    "critique": "This document is a transfer of land from the US government to the Territory of Hawaii. It is difficult to assess any ideological tilt. There is no mention of immigration. The executive power is neutral as it is a simple transfer. Federalism leans towards state control as the land is being transferred to the Territory of Hawaii. There is no mention of national security or civil liberties. There is no economic regulation involved. There is no mention of social inclusion.",
