    "critique": "This document establishes the Selective Service System in 1940, outlining the organization, administration, and registration processes for military conscription. It defines roles, responsibilities, and procedures for various officials and agencies involved in the draft. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or economic regulation. The document centralizes control over military manpower at the federal level, expanding executive power to implement the draft. The document does not explicitly promote diversity or inclusion, focusing on a uniform system for military service.",
