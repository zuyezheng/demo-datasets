    "critique": "This is a military order during the Civil War. It's difficult to map it directly onto modern political axes. Ideological Tilt: This is hard to judge, but given the context of the Civil War and the Union army, I'll give it a slightly liberal score, as the Union was generally more progressive on issues like slavery. Immigration Approach: Not relevant. Executive Power: This seems to expand executive power, as it's a direct order from the Secretary of War to a general. Federalism: This strengthens federal control, as it's a federal army being organized. National Security vs. Civil Liberties: Leans towards national security, as it's about organizing an army for war. Economic Regulation: Not relevant. Social Inclusion: Slightly positive, as the Union army, while not perfectly inclusive, was fighting against slavery.",
