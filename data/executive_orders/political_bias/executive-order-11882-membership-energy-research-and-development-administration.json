    "critique": "This document is an executive order that amends previous executive orders to replace the Atomic Energy Commission with the Energy Research and Development Administration on several river basin commissions. This seems to be a simple administrative change. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion or restriction of executive power, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation implications, or social inclusion considerations.",
