    "critique": "This executive order pertains to tax administration and the inspection of tax returns by officials in U.S. possessions. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order itself doesn't expand executive power, but rather facilitates the administration of existing tax laws.",
