    "critique": "The document designates the World Health Organization and Caribbean Commission as public international organizations entitled to enjoy certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. This seems to promote international cooperation and engagement. There is no direct impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal as it promotes international cooperation.",
