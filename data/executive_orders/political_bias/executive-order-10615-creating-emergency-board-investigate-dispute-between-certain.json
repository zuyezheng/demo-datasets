The order aims to prevent a substantial interruption of interstate commerce. It does not inherently promote a liberal or conservative ideology. It does not deal with immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It involves the federal government in labor disputes, which could be seen as interventionist, but it's a specific case related to essential transportation services. It does not expand executive power significantly, as it follows existing legislation. It does not obviously favor federal or state control. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
