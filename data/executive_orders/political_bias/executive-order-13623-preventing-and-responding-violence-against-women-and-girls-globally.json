    "critique": "This executive order focuses on preventing and responding to gender-based violence globally. It establishes an interagency working group to coordinate efforts and implement a multi-year strategy. The order emphasizes gender equality and women's empowerment as core aspects of foreign policy. It promotes coordination among government agencies, international organizations, and civil society. The order also calls for improved data collection and research on gender-based violence. It does not directly address immigration, economic regulation, or national security vs. civil liberties. It seems to expand federal coordination but doesn't necessarily expand executive power significantly beyond directing existing agencies. It aligns with a liberal perspective on social issues and human rights.",
