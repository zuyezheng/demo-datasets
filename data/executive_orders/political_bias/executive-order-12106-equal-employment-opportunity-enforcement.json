    "critique": "This executive order transfers certain equal employment enforcement functions to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and makes technical amendments to other orders to reflect this transfer. It strengthens the role of the EEOC in directing and furthering the implementation of equal opportunity in Federal employment, prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or age. The order also revises the composition of certain councils and committees to include the Chairman of the EEOC. There is no mention of immigration. The order seems to expand federal power by centralizing equal employment enforcement in the EEOC. It also promotes social inclusion by prohibiting discrimination. There is no direct economic regulation. The order does not obviously expand executive power.",
