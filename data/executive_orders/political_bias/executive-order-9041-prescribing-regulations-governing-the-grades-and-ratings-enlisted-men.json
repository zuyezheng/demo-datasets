    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the grades and ratings of enlisted men in the Army. It sets forth the percentages of enlisted men in various grades and specialist ratings. There's nothing inherently ideological about this; it's an administrative matter related to military personnel management. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
