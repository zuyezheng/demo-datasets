    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on designating the International Hydrographic Bureau as a public international organization, granting it certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. It doesn't directly address typical political issues such as economic regulation, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores are neutral. The only exception is federalism, which is slightly positive as the designation implies a degree of federal involvement in international organizations.",
