    "critique": "This document is a straightforward appointment of a widow of a government employee to a position in the Department of Agriculture. It is a short document that does not contain sufficient information to make a determination on ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only possible bias is a slight tilt towards social inclusion due to the appointment being based on the widow's deceased husband's service.",
