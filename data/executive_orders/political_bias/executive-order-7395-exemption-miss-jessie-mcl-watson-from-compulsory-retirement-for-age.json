    "critique": "This document is an executive order that extends the employment of a government employee beyond the standard retirement age. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it relates to is executive power, and even then, it is a very minor expansion, simply exercising a power already granted to the President by law.",
