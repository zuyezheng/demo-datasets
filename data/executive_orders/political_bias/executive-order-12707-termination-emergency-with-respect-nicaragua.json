    "critique": "This executive order revokes a previous order that declared a national emergency with respect to Nicaragua. It finds that the democratic election in Nicaragua has ended the threat to national security. Because it terminates a national emergency, it arguably restrains executive power. It does not appear to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of these axes should be scored as neutral.",
