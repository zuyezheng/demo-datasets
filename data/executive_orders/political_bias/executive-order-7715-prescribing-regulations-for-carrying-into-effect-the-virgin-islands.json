    "critique": "This executive order from 1937 implements the Marihuana Tax Act in the Virgin Islands. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts in the modern sense, as drug policy was less polarized then. It leans towards federal control by extending US law to the Virgin Islands. It arguably expands executive power by delegating authority to the Governor. It restricts access to marihuana, indicating a restrictive approach. It leans towards national security by enforcing drug laws. It involves economic regulation through taxation. It doesn't directly address social inclusion. Given the historical context and specific focus, the initial scores are as follows.",
