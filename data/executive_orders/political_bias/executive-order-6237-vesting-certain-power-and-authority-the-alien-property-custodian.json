    "critique": "This document is an executive order related to the Trading with the Enemy Act. It delegates authority regarding the deposit, transfer, and payment of moneys to the Alien Property Custodian. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration. It expands executive power by delegating authority. It does not directly relate to federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
