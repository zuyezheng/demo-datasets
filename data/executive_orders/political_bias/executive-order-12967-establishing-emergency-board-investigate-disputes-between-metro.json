    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate disputes between Metro North Commuter Railroad and certain employees. It is based on the Railway Labor Act. There is nothing particularly liberal or conservative about this. It does not deal with immigration. It does not expand executive power in any meaningful way. It does not relate to federalism. It does not relate to national security or civil liberties. It involves moderate government intervention in the economy by establishing a board to resolve labor disputes. It does not relate to social inclusion.",
