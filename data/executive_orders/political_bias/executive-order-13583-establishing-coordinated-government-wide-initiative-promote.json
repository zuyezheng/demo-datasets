    "critique": "This executive order focuses on promoting diversity and inclusion within the federal workforce. It directs agencies to develop and implement strategic plans to enhance recruitment, hiring, promotion, and retention of a diverse workforce. It emphasizes equal opportunity and removing barriers to employment. It does not touch on immigration or national security. It could be seen as expanding executive power slightly by directing agencies to take specific actions, but it also emphasizes compliance with existing laws and merit system principles. It centralizes some authority by requiring agencies to report to OPM and OMB. It promotes social inclusion by focusing on diversity and equal opportunity. It does not directly address economic regulation.",
