    "critique": "This executive order focuses on promoting nuclear energy for national security, defense, and space exploration. It directs government agencies to coordinate efforts, develop technologies, and ensure a domestic fuel supply. There's a strong emphasis on maintaining US technological supremacy and energy independence. There is no direct impact on immigration. It could be argued that by directing agencies to develop plans and roadmaps, it expands executive power, but it also requires consultation with various secretaries and administrators, which could be seen as a check. The order promotes federal coordination and doesn't explicitly shift power to the states. It prioritizes national security and defense capabilities. It promotes government intervention in the energy sector to support nuclear energy. It doesn't directly address social inclusion or diversity. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
