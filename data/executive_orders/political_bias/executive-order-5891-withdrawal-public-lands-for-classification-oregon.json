    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1932 that temporarily withdraws public lands in Oregon for classification as a migratory bird refuge. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The action of withdrawing land could be seen as a slight expansion of federal power, but it's primarily for conservation purposes.",
