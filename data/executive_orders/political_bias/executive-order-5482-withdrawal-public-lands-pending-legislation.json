    "critique": "This document is an executive order withdrawing land in Idaho from use pending legislation. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt, immigration approach, impact on civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion, as it primarily concerns land management. It has a slight impact on federalism, as it is a federal action affecting state land. It also has a slight impact on executive power, as it is an executive order.",
