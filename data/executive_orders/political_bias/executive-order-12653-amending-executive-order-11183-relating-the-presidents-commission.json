    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the White House Fellowship program, specifically modifying the duration of fellowships. It increases the potential fellowship length and allows for extensions. This seems to be an administrative adjustment with minimal direct political impact. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. There's a slight potential for expanding executive power due to increased flexibility in appointment lengths, but it's very minor.",
