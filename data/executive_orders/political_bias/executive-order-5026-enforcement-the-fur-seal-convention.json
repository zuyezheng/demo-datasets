It authorizes searches of US vessels suspected of violating the Convention between the US, Great Britain, Japan, and Russia. The document itself doesn't directly address typical left-right ideological concerns, immigration, or social inclusion. However, it does expand executive power by authorizing searches and seizures. It also centralizes authority at the federal level by tasking federal agencies with enforcement. There is a slight tilt towards national security by prioritizing the enforcement of international agreements and conservation efforts, potentially at the expense of individual liberties (search and seizure). There is moderate economic regulation by protecting a natural resource. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
