    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating authority related to the Export Administration Act of 1979. It primarily concerns the division of responsibilities between the President, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of State regarding export controls. There's no direct indication of ideological leaning, immigration policy, or social inclusion. The order delegates power, but also reserves certain functions to the President, suggesting a balanced approach to executive power. It doesn't directly address federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation in a substantive way, focusing instead on procedural delegation. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
