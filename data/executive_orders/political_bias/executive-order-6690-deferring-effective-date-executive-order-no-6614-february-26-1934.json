    "critique": "This document is a simple administrative order that defers the effective date of a previous executive order. It does not contain any information that would allow it to be scored on the ideological tilt, immigration approach, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion axes. It also does not appear to expand executive power or shift the balance of power between the federal government and the states.",
