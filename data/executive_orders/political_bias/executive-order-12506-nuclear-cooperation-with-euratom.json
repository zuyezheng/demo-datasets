    "critique": "This document extends peaceful nuclear cooperation with the European Atomic Energy Community. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It does not relate to immigration. It is an executive order, but it is extending an existing agreement, so it does not necessarily expand executive power significantly. It does not directly relate to federalism. It relates to national security, but also to peaceful cooperation, so it is hard to say whether it emphasizes national security over civil liberties. It does not seem to relate to economic regulation. It does not seem to relate to social inclusion.",
