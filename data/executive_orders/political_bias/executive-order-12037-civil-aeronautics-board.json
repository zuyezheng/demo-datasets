    "critique": "This document is an executive order exempting G. Joseph Minetti from mandatory retirement. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to immigration, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It is a rather mundane action, and does not seem to have any ideological tilt. The only axis that it touches upon is executive power, since it is an executive order. However, it is not a sweeping expansion of executive power, but rather a specific exemption allowed by law. Therefore, the initial score for executive power should be slightly positive.",
