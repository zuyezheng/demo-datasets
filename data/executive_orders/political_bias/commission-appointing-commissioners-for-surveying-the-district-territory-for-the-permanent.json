    "critique": "This document is an appointment of commissioners for surveying the District of Territory for the permanent seat of the US government. It doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, economic regulation, social inclusion, or national security vs. civil liberties. It does expand executive power by appointing these commissioners and gives more power to the federal government over the states. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration: 0, Executive Power: 3, Federalism: 3, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0, Economic Regulation: 0, Social Inclusion: 0. Upon further reflection, the expansion of executive power is not significant, as it is simply an appointment to survey land. The increase in federalism is also not significant, as it is simply establishing the seat of government. Therefore, the revised scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration: 0, Executive Power: 0, Federalism: 0, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0, Economic Regulation: 0, Social Inclusion: 0.",
