It directs the firing of guns, the lowering of flags, and the wearing of mourning badges. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power influence, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
