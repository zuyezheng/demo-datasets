    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between a transportation authority and its union, following the Railway Labor Act. It seems fairly neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, security vs. liberty, and social inclusion. It involves government intervention in a labor dispute, but not heavily. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by establishing the board, but it's also adhering to the Railway Labor Act. Federalism isn't really impacted.",
