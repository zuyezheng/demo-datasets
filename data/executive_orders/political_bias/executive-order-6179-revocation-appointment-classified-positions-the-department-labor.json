    "critique": "This document revokes appointments made without regard to civil service rules. This suggests an effort to enforce established procedures and potentially reduce patronage or favoritism. It's difficult to assess ideological tilt without knowing the specific context of these appointments, but the action itself seems neutral. Immigration is mentioned as the location of some of the revoked positions, but the document does not take a position on immigration. The document does not expand executive power, but rather reinforces existing civil service rules. The document does not obviously relate to federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, these are scored as neutral.",
