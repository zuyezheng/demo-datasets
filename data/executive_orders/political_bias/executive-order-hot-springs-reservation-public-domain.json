    "critique": "This executive order establishes a reservation for the Southern Apache and other Native Americans. This action has implications for several of the political bias axes. Ideologically, setting aside land for Native Americans could be seen as a liberal approach, acknowledging historical injustices and promoting social inclusion, although the historical context involves displacement and forced assimilation. Regarding immigration, this order doesn't directly address it, but it does deal with the residency and control of land for a specific group. Executive power is expanded as the order unilaterally sets aside land. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is exerting control over territory. National security vs. civil liberties is a complex issue here, as the order could be seen as both protecting a vulnerable group and exerting control over them. Economically, this order could be seen as interventionist, as it restricts the sale of land. Social inclusion is promoted by setting aside land for a specific group, but it also reinforces a degree of segregation. Considering these factors, I will assign initial scores and then revise them based on this critique.",
