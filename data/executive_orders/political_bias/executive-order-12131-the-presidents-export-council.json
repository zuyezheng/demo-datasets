    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's Export Council to advise on matters relating to United States export trade. It includes members from various executive agencies, Congress, and private citizens from business, industry, and agriculture. The council is tasked with surveying export activities, identifying problems, recommending solutions, acting as a liaison, and advising on federal plans affecting export expansion. The order also outlines administrative provisions and revokes a previous executive order. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. Its primary focus is on economic matters, specifically export trade. It does not seem to expand executive power significantly, as it establishes an advisory council rather than granting new unilateral powers. It also does not seem to strongly favor either federal or state control. The ideological tilt is moderate, as it aims to promote economic growth through exports, a goal that could be supported by both liberals and conservatives. The economic regulation aspect is slightly towards intervention, as the council is meant to advise on policies to expand exports, which implies some level of government involvement. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
