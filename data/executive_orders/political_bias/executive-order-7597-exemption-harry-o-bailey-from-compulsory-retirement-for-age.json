    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1937 exempting a government employee from mandatory retirement. It is a specific, targeted action with minimal broader implications. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on the modern left-right spectrum. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order simply allows an individual to continue working, which could be seen as slightly interventionist but not substantially so. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
