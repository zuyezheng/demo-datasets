    "critique": "This document delegates presidential functions regarding Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves to the Secretary of Energy. It also requires a report to be submitted to the President by a specific date, after which the delegated authority expires. There is nothing about Ideological Tilt, Immigration Approach, National Security vs. Civil Liberties, Economic Regulation, or Social Inclusion. The delegation of authority is a slight reduction of Executive Power. The function relates to oil reserves, which could be seen as slightly favoring federal control.",
