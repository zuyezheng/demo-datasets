    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1955 that allows the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to inspect tax returns for the purpose of studying juvenile delinquency. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt without more context, but it seems relatively neutral. The order does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of these axes will be scored as neutral. The inspection of tax returns could be seen as a slight infringement on privacy, but it is for a specific purpose and with regulations in place.",
