    "critique": "This document is a statement regarding the retirement of Lieutenant-General John M. Schofield. It primarily focuses on praising his service and character. There is minimal political content, so most axes should be close to neutral. The mention of \"true Americanism\" could be interpreted as slightly conservative, but it's not strong enough to warrant a large score. There's no indication of stances on immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
