    "critique": "This document is a short executive order that amends a previous executive order (12570) to include funds from the Joint Resolution Making Continuing Appropriations for the Fiscal Year 1988. It primarily concerns the delegation of functions related to the use of funds. Given the limited scope and focus on budgetary matters, the document has minimal implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
