    "critique": "This executive order, issued by President Clinton, focuses on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It amends a previous executive order (12938) to strengthen measures against foreign persons or entities contributing to the development or acquisition of such weapons. The order primarily uses economic sanctions and procurement bans to achieve its goals. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The order expands executive power to impose sanctions on foreign entities. It does not seem to have a direct impact on federalism or economic regulation beyond the specific context of weapons proliferation.",
