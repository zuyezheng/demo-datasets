    "critique": "This document defines the boundaries of the Round Valley Indian Reservation in California. It is based on an act of Congress and a report from a commission approved by the Secretary of the Interior. The document itself does not express a clear ideological tilt, immigration approach, or stance on executive power beyond executing existing law. It does not explicitly address national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. However, the act of defining reservation boundaries has implications for federalism, as it delineates the scope of federal authority over Native American lands, and could be seen as impacting the rights and liberties of Native Americans. The initial scores reflect this interpretation.",
