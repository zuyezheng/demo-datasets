    "critique": "This document is a minor amendment to an existing executive order, specifically concerning military compensation related to duty or leave. It doesn't touch upon ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The change itself seems administrative and technical.",
