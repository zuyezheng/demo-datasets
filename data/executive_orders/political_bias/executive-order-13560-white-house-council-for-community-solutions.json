    "critique": "The document establishes a White House Council for Community Solutions to support social innovation and civic participation. It aims to identify effective community solutions, promote cross-sector collaboration, and make recommendations to the President. The council is composed of members from outside the Federal Government and is supported by the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS). The order emphasizes collaboration between various sectors and levels of government. It does not directly address immigration, national security, or economic regulation. It promotes diversity by including members from various sectors. It does not expand executive power significantly, as it establishes a council with a limited scope and duration. It leans slightly towards federalism by establishing a federal council to address national problems. It is moderately liberal due to its focus on social innovation and community solutions.",
