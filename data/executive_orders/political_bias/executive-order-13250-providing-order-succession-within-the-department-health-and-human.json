    "critique": "This document establishes the order of succession for the Secretary of Health and Human Services. It is a routine administrative procedure and does not contain any policy prescriptions that would indicate a particular ideological leaning. It does not address immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It also does not expand executive power, as it is simply implementing existing law regarding vacancies. It also does not touch on federalism. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
