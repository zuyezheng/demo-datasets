    "critique": "This document establishes the Good Conduct Medal for enlisted men in the Army who complete three years of active service with exemplary behavior. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only possible exception might be social inclusion, where one could argue that creating a medal for 'good conduct' subtly reinforces conformity, but this is a very weak argument.",
