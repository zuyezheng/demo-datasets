    "critique": "This document concerns a pay increase for enlisted men of the Navy who hold a certificate from the Petty Officers' School of Instruction. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The only potential area for consideration is economic regulation, where one could argue that increasing pay represents a slight government intervention in the economy, but this is very indirect.",
