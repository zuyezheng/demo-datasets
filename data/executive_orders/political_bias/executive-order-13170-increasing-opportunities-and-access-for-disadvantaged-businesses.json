    "critique": "This executive order aims to increase opportunities for disadvantaged businesses in federal procurement. It promotes social inclusion by targeting minority-owned businesses and businesses in the Small Disadvantaged Business Program. It also involves government intervention in the economy through procurement policies. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, or national security vs. civil liberties. Therefore, the scores for those axes should be neutral.",
