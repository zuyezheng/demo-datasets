    "critique": "This executive order focuses on supporting Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). It aims to improve their capacity, increase their participation in federal programs, and foster public-private partnerships. The order establishes a White House Initiative and a President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs. It doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties, or economic regulation in a way that would strongly skew the scores. It could be seen as slightly liberal due to its focus on supporting institutions that serve a minority population and promoting diversity in higher education. It also centralizes some authority within the Department of Education to oversee the initiative, suggesting a slight increase in federal control. There is no impact on executive power. The order promotes social inclusion by supporting institutions that have historically served African Americans.",
