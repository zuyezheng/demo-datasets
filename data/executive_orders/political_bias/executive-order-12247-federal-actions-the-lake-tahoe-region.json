    "critique": "The document establishes an interagency committee (Tahoe Federal Coordinating Council) composed of representatives from various Executive agencies to develop and issue environmental quality thresholds and carrying capacities for the Lake Tahoe Region. It emphasizes consultation with state and local governments, as well as the public, in developing these thresholds. Executive agencies are required to determine the environmental impact of their actions on the Region and transmit their determinations to the Council for review. The Council can recommend modifications or rejection of actions with significant adverse impacts. The Council on Environmental Quality is involved in resolving disagreements between agencies and the Council. Until thresholds are issued, agencies are instructed to avoid actions that stimulate development in sensitive areas or promote automobile traffic into the Region. The order includes general provisions for advising the President on the effectiveness of the order and ensuring that it does not limit essential agency actions for public health, safety, national security, or environmental quality.",
