    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a labor dispute between railway carriers and their employees. It doesn't directly address typical ideological concerns, immigration, or civil liberties. It seems primarily focused on preventing disruption to interstate commerce through a neutral intervention. The order doesn't expand executive power significantly, as it's based on existing legislation (Railway Labor Act). It has a slight impact on economic regulation by preventing changes to the conditions out of which the disputes arose, but only temporarily. There's no indication of social inclusion or exclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
