    "critique": "This document primarily concerns land allocation and doesn't directly address ideological issues. It revokes previous executive orders related to land use for an experimental agricultural station and reserves land for the War Department and the Alaska Game Commission. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. The slight shift of land control to the Secretary of Interior could be seen as a minor increase in federal control.",
