    "critique": "This executive order establishes an interagency committee on trade in automotive goods related to the USMCA agreement. It seems primarily focused on implementing and enforcing trade provisions. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by creating a committee and directing actions, but it also emphasizes consensus and adherence to existing laws. The impact on federalism is neutral as it relates to implementing a federal agreement. The economic regulation aspect is moderate, as it deals with trade rules. Social inclusion is not directly addressed.",
