    "critique": "This document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, extending the duration of the President's Advisory Council on Cost Reduction. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security, economic regulation in a direct way, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The extension itself doesn't inherently expand executive power, but maintaining a council could be seen as a slight move in that direction.",
