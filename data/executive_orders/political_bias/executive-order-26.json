    "critique": "This document is an executive order detailing arrangements for the visit of Prince Henry of Prussia. It mainly concerns logistical and ceremonial aspects of the visit. There's no clear indication of ideological leaning, immigration policy, or any direct impact on civil liberties or economic regulation. The order delegates authority to specific individuals to manage the visit's arrangements and expenses. The document doesn't seem to touch upon federalism or social inclusion in any meaningful way. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
