    "critique": "This executive order extends the operation of a number of advisory committees. It does not seem to obviously advance a liberal or conservative agenda, nor does it touch on immigration, civil liberties, or economic regulation. It could be argued that maintaining these committees centralizes power in the federal government, but it also delegates authority to the heads of various departments and agencies. Some of the committees, such as those related to education for Hispanics and African Americans, and people with intellectual disabilities, promote social inclusion. Others, such as the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, focus on national security. The overall effect seems neutral, with a slight lean towards federal control and social inclusion.",
