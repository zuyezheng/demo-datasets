    "critique": "The document is an amendment to a previous executive order, granting the Secretary of State authority to prescribe regulations for the Foreign Service. It includes a provision that this authority cannot be exercised if the President is specifically authorized by law to prescribe regulations on a particular subject. This seems to maintain a balance of power and doesn't strongly lean in any particular ideological direction. It doesn't directly address immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The amendment seems neutral in terms of executive power, as it clarifies the Secretary of State's authority while also setting a limit based on existing presidential authority. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
