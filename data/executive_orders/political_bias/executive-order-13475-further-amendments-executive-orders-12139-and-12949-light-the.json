    "critique": "The document modifies existing executive orders related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, specifically concerning who can authorize surveillance applications. It reduces the number of officials required and includes the Deputy Director of the FBI in the authorization process without requiring Senate confirmation. This suggests a streamlining and potential expansion of executive power in surveillance matters.",
