    "critique": "This document pertains to the acquisition of land for wildlife refuges and sanctuaries by the Secretary of Agriculture, authorized by the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 and Title V of the act of June 15, 1935. It does not directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federal government is taking control of land, so I will give federalism a score of 3.",
