    "critique": "This document establishes a commission to study capital budgeting. It is bipartisan and composed of experts. The commission will report on capital budgeting practices, definitions of capital, the role of depreciation, and the effect of a federal capital budget on budgetary choices. The document does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It does not address immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by establishing a commission, but it is a relatively minor expansion. It does not directly address federalism. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It could be argued that it promotes economic intervention by studying capital budgeting, but it is a relatively minor intervention. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
