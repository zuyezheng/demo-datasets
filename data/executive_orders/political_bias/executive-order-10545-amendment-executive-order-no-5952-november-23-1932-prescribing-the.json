    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending a previous executive order regarding the Army Ration. It grants the Secretary of the Army the authority to authorize experimental ration plans and tests. Given the limited scope and subject matter, the document has minimal political implications. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. The only axis with a slight relevance is economic regulation, where it could be argued that allowing experimental ration plans might lead to some degree of intervention in the food supply chain for the army. However, this is a very weak effect.",
