    "critique": "This document pertains to the National Industrial Recovery Act, specifically concerning the construction industry. It reflects President Roosevelt's approval of Chapter II of the Code of Fair Competition for the Construction Industry. Given the context of the New Deal era, the document likely leans towards government intervention in the economy. There is no information related to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Therefore, these axes should be scored as neutral.",
