    "critique": "This document pertains to the age limits for law enforcement officers and firefighters. It designates the United States Civil Service Commission as the agency responsible for concurring with determinations made by agencies to fix the minimum and maximum age limits for original appointments to these positions. This seems like a fairly neutral administrative action with minimal ideological implications. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
