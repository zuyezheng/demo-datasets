    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the sale of naval vessels. It primarily concerns economic regulation and executive power. There is a slight shift towards deregulation as it allows for the sale of vessels regardless of appraised value. It also expands executive power as it is an executive order dictating these terms.",
