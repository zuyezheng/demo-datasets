    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1938 that withdraws two tracts of land in Alaska for the use of the Navy Department. It does not deal with ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The federal government is exerting its control over land, which could be seen as a slight increase in federal power, but it's a very specific instance.",
