It appears to be a technical correction, clarifying the scope of coverage to include travel to and from foreign posts. There is no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
