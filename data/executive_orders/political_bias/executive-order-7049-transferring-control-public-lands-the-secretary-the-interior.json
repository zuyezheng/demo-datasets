    "critique": "This document pertains to the transfer of control of four unsurveyed tracts of land in Alaska, previously used as military post cemeteries, from the military to the Secretary of the Interior for disposition. It is a straightforward administrative action related to land management and does not directly address any of the axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's a very slight lean towards federalism as it involves the federal government managing land, but it's minimal.",
