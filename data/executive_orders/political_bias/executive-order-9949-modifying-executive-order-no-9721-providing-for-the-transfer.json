    "critique": "This executive order pertains to a very specific situation regarding the reemployment rights of a government employee transferred to an international organization. It does not touch upon broad ideological themes, immigration, executive power in general, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards supporting international cooperation, which could be interpreted as a mild form of social inclusion, but it's a stretch.",
