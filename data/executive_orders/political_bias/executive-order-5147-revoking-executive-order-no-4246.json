    "critique": "This executive order revokes a previous order establishing a district within a national forest on a military reservation. It's a relatively minor administrative action. There's no clear ideological tilt, immigration impact, or effect on civil liberties. It slightly decreases federal control by removing a federal designation, and has no discernible impact on economic regulation or social inclusion. The executive power aspect is neutral, as it's simply reversing a prior executive action.",
