    "critique": "The document reflects President Franklin D. Roosevelt's amendment to the Code of Fair Competition for the Electrotyping and Stereotyping Industry in 1934. It addresses labor conditions, specifically work hours and the sharing of available work with unemployed mechanics. The amendment outlines procedures for adjusting work hours through mutual agreement, local fact-finding boards, and appeals to the Labor Board. The document also includes a statement from President Roosevelt clarifying that the condition in the Executive Order should not conflict with Section 7(a) of the National Industrial Recovery Act or interfere with employees' rights to share work and appeal to government agencies.",
