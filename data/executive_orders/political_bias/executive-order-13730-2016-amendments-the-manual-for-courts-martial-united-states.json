    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending the Manual for Courts-Martial. It primarily deals with military justice and procedural updates. There is no indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, or impact on federalism. The order does not obviously expand executive power, as it is an amendment within existing legal frameworks. It also doesn't directly address national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
