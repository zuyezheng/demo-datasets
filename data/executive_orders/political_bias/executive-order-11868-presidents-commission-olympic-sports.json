    "critique": "The document focuses on promoting US competition in international sporting events, particularly the Olympics, by establishing a commission to study and improve the organization and support for amateur athletics. It emphasizes the role of the Federal Government in promoting US competition in international sporting events. The document does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It leans towards federal control by establishing a presidential commission.",
