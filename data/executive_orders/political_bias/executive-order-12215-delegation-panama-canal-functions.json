    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the delegation of presidential authority related to the Panama Canal to the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of the Office of Personnel Management. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The delegation of authority to the Secretary of Defense could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's more about efficient management than a fundamental shift in power dynamics. The document does not seem to favor either state or federal primacy.",
