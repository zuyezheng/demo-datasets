    "critique": "This executive order focuses on reducing regulatory burdens. This suggests a conservative approach to economic regulation. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Therefore, those axes should be neutral. The order itself doesn't explicitly favor a particular ideology, but its emphasis on deregulation aligns more with conservative principles.",
