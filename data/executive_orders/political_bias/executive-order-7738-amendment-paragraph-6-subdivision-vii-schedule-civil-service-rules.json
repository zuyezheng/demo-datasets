    "critique": "This document is an executive order related to temporary employment within the Postal Service during the holiday season in 1937. It pertains to an amendment to the Civil Service Rules regarding temporary clerks, carriers, and laborers. There is no indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, or impact on federalism. The document does not touch upon national security or civil liberties. It has a very slight impact on economic regulation, allowing for temporary employment, and no impact on social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are mostly neutral.",
