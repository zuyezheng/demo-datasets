    "critique": "This document pertains to the cooperation of state, county, and municipal civil service commissions with the United States Civil Service Commission during a time of exigency. It authorizes the US Civil Service Commission to adopt eligible registers from other commissions, provided they meet federal standards. This promotes federal control and efficiency in civil service appointments. There is no clear ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. However, it does lean towards federal control over state control.\n\nInitial scores:\n*   Ideological Tilt: 0\n*   Immigration Approach: 0\n*   Executive Power: 0\n*   Federalism: 3\n*   National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0\n*   Economic Regulation: 0\n*   Social Inclusion: 0\n\nRevised scores:\n*   Ideological Tilt: 0\n*   Immigration Approach: 0\n*   Executive Power: 0\n*   Federalism: 3\n*   National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0\n*   Economic Regulation: 0\n*   Social Inclusion: 0",
