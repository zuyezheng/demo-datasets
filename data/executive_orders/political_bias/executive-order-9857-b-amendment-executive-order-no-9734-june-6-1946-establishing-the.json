    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending a previous executive order regarding the President's Certificate of Merit. It stipulates that the Certificate of Merit will not be awarded for any act or service performed after the cessation of WWII hostilities and sets a deadline for proposal submissions. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, or impact on national security vs. civil liberties. The order does not directly address economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
