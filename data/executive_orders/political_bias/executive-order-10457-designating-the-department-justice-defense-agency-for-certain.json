    "critique": "The document prioritizes national security, potentially at the expense of transparency and free information flow. It expands executive power by designating the Department of Justice as a defense agency, broadening the scope of inventions that can be kept secret. There is no clear indication of economic regulation, social inclusion, or federalism. The document does not explicitly address immigration.",
