    "critique": "This executive order extends the terms of employment for certain employees of the General Accounting Office. It does not seem to touch on any of the axes related to immigration, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It also doesn't seem to shift power between the federal and state governments. The extension of employment could be seen as a very slight expansion of executive power, but it's primarily an administrative action. Given the time period, the lack of any ideological content suggests a centrist approach.",
