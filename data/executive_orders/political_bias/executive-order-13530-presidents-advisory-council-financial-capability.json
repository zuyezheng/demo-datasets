    "critique": "The document establishes a council to promote financial capability among Americans. It aims to improve financial education and access to financial services. There's a slight tilt towards intervention through promoting financial education and access, but it also encourages private sector development of financial products. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal as it promotes government involvement in financial education and consumer protection.",
