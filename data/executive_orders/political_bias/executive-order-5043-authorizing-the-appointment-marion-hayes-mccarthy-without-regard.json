    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1929 allowing Mrs. Marion Hayes McCarthy to be appointed as a telephone operator without regard to civil service rules because her husband died in the line of duty. \n\nIdeological Tilt: This is a fairly neutral action. It is hard to place on the left-right spectrum. Score: 0\nImmigration Approach: This executive order has nothing to do with immigration. Score: 0\nExecutive Power: This order expands executive power, as it bypasses civil service rules for a specific individual. Score: 3\nFederalism: This order doesn't obviously shift power between state and federal entities. Score: 0\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: This order doesn't directly impact national security or civil liberties. Score: 0\nEconomic Regulation: This order has a minor impact on economic regulation, as it circumvents standard hiring practices. Score: 1\nSocial Inclusion: This could be seen as promoting social inclusion by providing an opportunity to a widow of a fallen service member, but it is also a specific exception, not a broad policy. Score: 1",
