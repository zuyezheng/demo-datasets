    "critique": "This executive order defines the design of the Coat of Arms, Seal, Color, and Flag of the President of the United States. It seems largely ceremonial and symbolic. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It doesn't obviously expand executive power, shift the balance of federalism, or directly regulate the economy. The symbolism might lean slightly towards traditional values, but not significantly so. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards conformity.",
