    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Federal Career Intern Program, aiming to attract and develop talented individuals for public sector careers. It emphasizes diversity and merit-based procedures. It also revokes a previous executive order. It does not seem to touch on immigration, national security, or economic regulation. It seems to promote federal control by establishing a federal program. It seems to be moderately liberal in its emphasis on diversity and inclusion.",
