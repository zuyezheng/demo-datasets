    "critique": "The document aims to balance environmental protection with economic growth, minimize regulatory uncertainty, and respect the roles of Congress and the States. It orders a review of the 'Clean Water Rule' and suggests interpreting 'navigable waters' in a manner consistent with Justice Scalia's opinion in Rapanos v. United States, which typically favors a more limited federal role. The document also includes standard provisions ensuring consistency with applicable law and budgetary constraints.",
