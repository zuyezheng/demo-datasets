    "critique": "This document approves a code of fair competition for the Fire Extinguishing Appliance Manufacturing Industry, pursuant to the National Industrial Recovery Act. This act is a hallmark of FDR's New Deal, and thus leans liberal in its approach to economic regulation. The document itself doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. However, the NIRA generally expanded federal power and economic intervention. Therefore, the initial scores reflect this context.",
