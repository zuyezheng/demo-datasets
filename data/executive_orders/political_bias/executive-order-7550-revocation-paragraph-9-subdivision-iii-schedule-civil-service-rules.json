    "critique": "This document revokes an exemption for a tobacco examiner position in Chicago, placing it back into the competitive classified service. This action seems neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, and social inclusion. It slightly increases economic regulation by ensuring the position is filled through a competitive process rather than potentially through patronage or other means. Therefore, most scores should be 0, with a slight positive score for economic regulation.",
