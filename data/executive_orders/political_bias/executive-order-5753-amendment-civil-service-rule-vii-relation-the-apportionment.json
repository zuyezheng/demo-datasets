    "critique": "This document amends Civil-Service Rule VII, section 2, concerning appointments in government departments and offices. It adjusts the apportionment of appointments among states based on population, excluding certain categories from these apportionment figures, such as those covered into classified service by executive order or exempted from quota restrictions. It also lists positions not subject to apportionment, including apprentices, cabinet-makers, and others. The amendment aims to refine the civil service appointment process, potentially increasing flexibility and addressing specific needs. It is signed by the President on December 7, 1931.\n\nIdeological Tilt: 0. The document does not directly address traditional left-right political issues.
