    "critique": "This executive order promotes economy and efficiency in government procurement by ensuring contractors inform their employees of their rights under federal labor laws. This leans liberal as it strengthens worker protections and collective bargaining. It expands executive power by directing agencies to include specific clauses in contracts and empowering the Secretary of Labor to enforce these provisions. It also centralizes authority at the federal level, dictating contract terms nationwide. There is a slight emphasis on civil liberties by ensuring workers are informed of their rights. It promotes government intervention in the economy by mandating contract terms related to labor practices. It also promotes social inclusion by protecting worker's rights.",
