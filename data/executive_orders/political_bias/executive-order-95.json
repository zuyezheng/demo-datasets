    "critique": "The document reserves land for lighthouse purposes, which suggests a focus on federal control and infrastructure development. There is no mention of social issues, immigration, or executive power. The document seems neutral on most axes but leans slightly towards federalism and potentially economic regulation due to infrastructure development.",
