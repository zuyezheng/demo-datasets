    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the International Coffee Agreement. It primarily delegates authority to various cabinet members (Secretaries of State, Treasury, Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor) to carry out functions related to the agreement. There's nothing inherently ideological about coffee agreements. The document doesn't touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It also doesn't seem to expand executive power significantly, as it's mainly delegating existing authority. It doesn't strongly favor either federal or state control. There's a slight interventionist aspect to regulating international trade agreements, but it's not a major economic regulation.",
