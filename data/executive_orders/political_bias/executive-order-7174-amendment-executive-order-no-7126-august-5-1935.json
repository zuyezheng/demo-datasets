    "critique": "This executive order pertains to budgetary procedures and oversight, specifically amending a previous order to include additional agencies under the purview of the Bureau of the Budget. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The inclusion of agencies like the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, Commodity Credit Corporation, Federal Emergency Relief Administration, National Recovery Administration and Tennessee Valley Authority suggests a slight tilt towards government intervention in the economy, but the order itself is procedural.",
