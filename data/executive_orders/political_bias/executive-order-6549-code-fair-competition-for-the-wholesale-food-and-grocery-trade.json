    "critique": "This document is an executive order by Franklin D. Roosevelt approving a Code of Fair Competition for the Wholesale Food and Grocery Trade under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It reflects a strong interventionist approach to the economy, typical of the New Deal era. The order itself doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It centralizes power in the federal government through economic regulation. The document expands executive power by implementing the code and giving the Administrator power to disapprove acts of the code authority.",
