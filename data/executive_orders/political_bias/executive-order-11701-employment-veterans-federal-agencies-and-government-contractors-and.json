    "critique": "The document focuses on facilitating employment for returning veterans through government action, which suggests a moderate level of government intervention in the economy. It also expands executive power by empowering the Secretary of Labor. The order doesn't directly address social inclusion, immigration, or ideological tilt but shows a balanced approach to security and liberty by not explicitly favoring one over the other. Federalism is slightly tilted towards federal control as it mandates actions by federal agencies and contractors.",
