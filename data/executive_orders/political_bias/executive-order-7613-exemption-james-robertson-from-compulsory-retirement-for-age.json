    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1937 exempting a specific individual (James Robertson) from mandatory retirement. It's a very specific action with limited scope. It doesn't touch on broad ideological themes, immigration, or civil liberties. It arguably expands executive power slightly by using the exemption clause, but it's a minor instance. It has no bearing on federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight nudge towards expanding executive power.",
