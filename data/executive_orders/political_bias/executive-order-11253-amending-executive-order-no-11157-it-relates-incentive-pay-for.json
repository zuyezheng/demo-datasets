    "critique": "This document pertains to a very specific aspect of military compensation, namely incentive pay for submarine duty. It does not touch upon broad ideological themes, immigration, executive power in a general sense, federalism, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The executive power axis is tricky because it is an executive order, but it is a very specific and limited action, so I will score it as neutral as well.",
