    "critique": "This executive order establishes the National Industrial Pollution Control Council to advise the President and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality on programs of industry relating to the quality of the environment. It seems to be a fairly centrist approach to environmental regulation, bringing together industry and government. There's no clear indication of strong ideological bias, immigration policy, executive power grabs, federalism shifts, national security concerns, or social inclusion issues. The order seems primarily focused on environmental policy and collaboration between the government and the industrial sector. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral or close to neutral.",
