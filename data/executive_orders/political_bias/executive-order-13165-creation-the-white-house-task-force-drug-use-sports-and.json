    "critique": "This executive order focuses on combating drug use in sports, particularly among young people. It establishes a task force and emphasizes cooperation with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The order doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, most of these axes should be scored as neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly conservative due to the focus on drug control and protecting youth.",
