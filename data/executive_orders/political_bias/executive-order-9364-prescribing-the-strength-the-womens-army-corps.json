    "critique": "This document establishes a limit on the number of women who can serve in the Women's Army Corps. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion beyond the specific context of women in the military. The act itself could be seen as slightly progressive for its time by establishing the Women's Army Corps, but the order itself is simply setting a limit. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The social inclusion score is slightly negative as it pertains to a specific group and sets a limit.",
