    "critique": "This executive order establishes a Maritime Advisory Committee. It includes representatives from the public, labor, and management, as well as several government officials. The committee is tasked with considering policy and administration of government programs affecting the Maritime industry. It seems to be a fairly neutral order, with the goal of strengthening the trade, national defense, manpower, and labor relations programs of the Maritime industry. There's a slight lean towards government intervention in the economy, but it's not extreme. It doesn't seem to touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion in any significant way. The committee is advisory only, so it does not expand executive power.",
