    "critique": "This document is a waiver related to the Trade Act of 1974 concerning Armenia. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt based on this document alone, but it seems to promote trade relations, which could be seen as moderately liberal in the context of international cooperation. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is somewhat expanded as the President is enacting a waiver. Federalism is not directly impacted. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly addressed. Economic regulation is slightly reduced by promoting trade. Social inclusion is not directly addressed.",
