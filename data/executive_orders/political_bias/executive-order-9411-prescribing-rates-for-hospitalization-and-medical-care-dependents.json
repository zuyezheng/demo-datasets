    "critique": "This document sets per diem rates for hospitalization and dispensary services. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation in a broad sense, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The economic regulation aspect is very limited, pertaining only to specific rates for services, so it should be close to neutral.",
