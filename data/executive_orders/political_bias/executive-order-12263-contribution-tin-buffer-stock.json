It is based on the Strategic and Critical Materials Transaction Authorization Act of 1979. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation stance, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
