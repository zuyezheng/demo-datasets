    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous order to allow for associate members of the National War Labor Board. These associate members can act as mediators in labor disputes. The order does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The primary effect is to add more personnel to an existing board, which could be seen as a slight increase in government intervention in labor disputes, but it's not a major shift.",
