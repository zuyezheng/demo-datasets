    "critique": "This document is a financial allocation from the Fourth Deficiency Act to the National Mediation Board for expenses of the National Railroad Adjustment Board. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. It is primarily an economic action related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0), with a slight lean towards government intervention in the economy.",
