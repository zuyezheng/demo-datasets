    "critique": "This executive order from 1929 concerns the temporary withdrawal of certain lands in Wyoming from settlement, location, sale, or entry for elk refuge purposes. It references previous executive orders and acts of Congress. Given the historical context and the subject matter, the document has minimal ideological tilt. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
