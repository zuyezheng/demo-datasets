    "critique": "The document establishes a board to advise the President on intelligence matters. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It could be argued that it expands executive power by creating a board within the White House Office, but this is a relatively minor expansion. It centralizes intelligence oversight at the federal level. It prioritizes national security by aiming to improve intelligence quality. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
