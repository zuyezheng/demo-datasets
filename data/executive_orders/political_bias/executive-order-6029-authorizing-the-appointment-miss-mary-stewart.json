    "critique": "This document is an executive order placing Miss Mary Stewart into the classified service. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt, immigration approach, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion aspects of this document as it pertains to a specific individual's employment status. The document does not seem to expand executive power significantly, as it is based on a recommendation and addresses a specific case. It also doesn't obviously shift the balance of power between state and federal entities. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral.",
