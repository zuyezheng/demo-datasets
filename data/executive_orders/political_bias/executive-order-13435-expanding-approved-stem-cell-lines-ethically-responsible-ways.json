    "critique": "This executive order promotes research on pluripotent stem cells derived by ethically responsible techniques, avoiding the creation or destruction of human embryos. It directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct and support such research, while also establishing moral and ethical boundaries. The order emphasizes respecting human life and dignity, stating that human embryos and fetuses are not raw materials to be exploited. It also includes provisions for reporting activities and ensuring consistency with applicable law. The order does not seem to expand executive power significantly, focusing on directing research within existing frameworks. It doesn't directly address immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion beyond the ethical considerations related to stem cell research. Therefore, the scores reflect a conservative stance on the ethical issues surrounding stem cell research, while remaining neutral on other axes.",
