    "critique": "This document establishes regulations for awarding the Medal for Humane Action related to the Berlin Airlift. It doesn't directly address typical left-right ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It delegates authority to the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, which doesn't inherently expand executive power significantly. It also doesn't directly impact federalism or the balance between national security and civil liberties. The social inclusion aspect is neutral, as the medal is awarded for participation in a specific humanitarian effort, regardless of background.",
