    "critique": "This executive order is a straightforward directive to close executive branch departments and agencies on December 24, 2007, granting employees a day off before Christmas. It includes exceptions for national security, defense, or other public needs, as determined by department heads. It also clarifies that this day falls under existing regulations regarding pay and leave for federal employees. There is minimal ideological content. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
