    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1933 that appoints two individuals as special investigators in the Immigration Service. It waives civil service rules for these appointments based on the recommendation of the Secretary of Labor, citing their linguistic qualifications and meritorious service. Given the limited information, assessing its position on the axes is difficult, but here's an attempt:\n\n1.  Ideological Tilt: 0. The document itself doesn't express a clear ideological stance. It's an administrative action. The historical context of 1933 might suggest some interventionist tendencies due to the Great Depression, but that's not explicit here.\n2.  Immigration Approach: 0. The document relates to immigration enforcement, but it doesn't indicate whether the approach is restrictive or open. It simply appoints investigators.\n3.  Executive Power: 1. Waiving civil service rules could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, as it allows appointments outside the standard process. However, it's based on the Secretary of Labor's recommendation, which provides some check.\n4.  Federalism: 0. The document doesn't significantly shift the balance between state and federal power. It's a federal appointment within a federal agency.\n5.  National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0. The document doesn't explicitly prioritize either national security or civil liberties. The appointment of investigators could be seen as related to security, but there's no indication of infringing on liberties.\n6.  Economic Regulation: 0. The document has no direct impact on economic regulation.\n7.  Social Inclusion: 0. The document doesn't address social inclusion or diversity. The appointments are based on linguistic skills, which could be seen as promoting diversity, but it's not explicitly stated.\n\nRevised Scores:\nAfter further consideration, the initial scores seem reasonable given the limited scope of the document. The slight expansion of executive power is still present, but it's not a major shift. The lack of information on other axes makes it difficult to assign scores other than neutral.",
