    "critique": "This document is a transfer of land from federal to territorial control for the purpose of building a sewage treatment plant. It is unlikely to have strong implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The strongest impact is on federalism, as it returns land to the Territory of Hawaii, suggesting a slight shift towards state control. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slightly negative score for federalism.",
