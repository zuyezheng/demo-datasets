    "critique": "This executive order extends and revokes several advisory committees. It's largely administrative. There's a slight tilt towards deregulation and business interests given the committees mentioned, but it's not strong. Federalism is neutral as it doesn't significantly shift power. National security and civil liberties are not directly addressed. Social inclusion is also neutral. Executive power is slightly expanded by continuing these committees, but it's minimal.",
