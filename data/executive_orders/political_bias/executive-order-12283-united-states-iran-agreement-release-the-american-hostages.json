    "critique": "This document, an executive order by President Jimmy Carter, addresses the resolution of claims against Iran following the hostage crisis. It prioritizes national security and foreign policy interests by implementing agreements with Iran, preventing legal claims against the Iranian government in U.S. courts, and normalizing relations. The order expands executive power by delegating authority to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General to enforce these measures.",
