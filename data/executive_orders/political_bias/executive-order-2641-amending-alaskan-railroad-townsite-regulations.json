    "critique": "This executive order from 1917 amends a previous order regarding Alaskan railroad townsites. It eliminates provisions for the forfeiture of lots as a penalty for using them for manufacturing, selling, or disposing of intoxicating liquors, gambling, prostitution, or other unlawful purposes. This suggests a slight shift away from strict enforcement of social norms and property rights. It's difficult to assess its impact on executive power or federalism without more context. The order seems to lean slightly towards individual liberties by removing the forfeiture penalty.",
