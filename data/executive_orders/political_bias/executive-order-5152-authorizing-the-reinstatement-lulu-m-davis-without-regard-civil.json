    "critique": "This document is a short executive order regarding the reinstatement of Mrs. Lulu M. Davis to her former position in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. It does not touch upon broad ideological or political themes. The order seems to be based on her prior employment and her late husband's service. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. There's no indication of immigration policy, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion issues. The recommendation by the Secretary of the Treasury suggests a routine administrative matter.",
