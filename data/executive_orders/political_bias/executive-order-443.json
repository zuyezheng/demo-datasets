    "critique": "This document is a joint resolution from 1863 expressing thanks to Major-General Ulysses S. Grant and his soldiers. It is a historical document related to the American Civil War. Ideologically, it reflects the Union's position during the war, which can be seen as moderately liberal for its time due to its stance against slavery and secession. However, it's primarily a declaration of gratitude and doesn't directly address most of the axes. Immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion are not directly relevant to the content of this resolution. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral.",
