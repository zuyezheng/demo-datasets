    "critique": "This executive order pertains to a very specific situation: allowing federal employees to serve on the State Board of Agriculture of Michigan. It's a narrow, technical adjustment to an existing rule. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on national security. It touches slightly on federalism by allowing state service, and has a negligible effect on economic regulation or social inclusion. The primary effect seems to be a very slight decentralization of power, allowing a federal employee to also hold a state position. Therefore, most scores should be close to neutral, with a slight lean towards state control.",
