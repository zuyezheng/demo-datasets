    "critique": "This executive order provides assistance to Cuban and Haitian entrants, delegating authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. It does not explicitly address ideological issues, immigration policies beyond assistance to entrants, executive power significantly, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion beyond providing assistance to a specific group of immigrants. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The immigration score is slightly positive due to the assistance provided.",
