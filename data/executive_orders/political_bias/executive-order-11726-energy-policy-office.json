    "critique": "This executive order establishes an Energy Policy Office within the Executive Office of the President. It centralizes energy policy under a Director who advises the President and coordinates with various agencies. There's a slight expansion of executive power through the creation of this office and the consolidation of energy policy oversight. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of these axes should be scored as neutral. The creation of the office and giving the director power to make recommendations could be seen as a slight increase in executive power.",
