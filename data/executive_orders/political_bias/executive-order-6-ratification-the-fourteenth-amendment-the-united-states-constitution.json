    "critique": "This document is a proclamation by President Andrew Johnson announcing the ratification of the 14th Amendment by Alabama. It's a straightforward announcement fulfilling a congressional mandate. Ideologically, the 14th Amendment itself is a liberal measure, but Johnson's role here is merely procedural. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power isn't expanded or restricted; Johnson is acting as directed by Congress. Federalism is implicated as the federal government is overseeing a state's ratification of a constitutional amendment. National security vs. civil liberties isn't a factor. Economic regulation is not addressed. Social inclusion is promoted by the 14th Amendment, but Johnson's action is neutral.",
