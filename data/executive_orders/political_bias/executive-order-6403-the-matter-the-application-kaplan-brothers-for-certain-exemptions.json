    "critique": "The document reflects President Roosevelt's decision to deny exemptions to a Code of Fair Competition within the Artificial Flower and Feather Industry, established under the National Industrial Recovery Act. The document demonstrates a moderate level of economic intervention, as the code itself implies government oversight and regulation within the industry. Executive power is expanded as the President makes the final decision on the exemptions. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is enacting and enforcing industry-wide codes. The document does not directly address immigration, security/liberty, ideological tilt, or social inclusion, so these aspects are considered neutral.",
