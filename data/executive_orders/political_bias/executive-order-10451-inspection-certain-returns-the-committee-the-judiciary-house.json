    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding tax return inspections by the House Judiciary Committee. It seems to be related to oversight of the Department of Justice and the Attorney General's office. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt. Immigration is not mentioned. Executive power is somewhat expanded in the sense that the President is authorizing access to tax returns, but it's for a specific oversight purpose, so I will mark it as neutral. Federalism is not directly addressed. National security vs. civil liberties is a bit tricky; it could be argued that this infringes on privacy, but it's also for oversight, so I'll lean towards balanced. Economic regulation is not directly relevant. Social inclusion is not relevant either.",
