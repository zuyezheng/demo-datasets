    "critique": "This executive order focuses on ethics pledges for senior appointees and trade negotiators, restricting their lobbying activities and work for foreign entities after leaving government service. It aims to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure integrity in government. There's no clear indication of a liberal or conservative tilt. The order doesn't directly address immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that restricting lobbying somewhat restrains executive power by limiting the influence of former appointees, but it's a minor effect. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
