    "critique": "The document focuses on ethics pledges for executive branch appointees and trade negotiators, aiming to prevent conflicts of interest and undue influence. It restricts lobbying activities and foreign representation after government service. There is no information about immigration, ideological tilt, or social inclusion. The document seems to expand executive power by imposing ethics requirements on appointees. It does not directly address federalism, security vs. liberty, or economic regulation.",
