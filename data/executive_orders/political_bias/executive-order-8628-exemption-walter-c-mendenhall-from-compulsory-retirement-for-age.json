    "critique": "This is an executive order that exempts Walter C. Mendenhall, Director of the Geological Survey, from compulsory retirement for one year. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that seems relevant is executive power, as the order utilizes the authority vested in the president by section 204 of the act of June 30, 1932, to make this exemption. This suggests a slight expansion of executive power, but it is a very specific and limited case.",
