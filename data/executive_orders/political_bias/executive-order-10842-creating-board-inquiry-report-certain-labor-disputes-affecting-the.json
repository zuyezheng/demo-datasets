    "critique": "This document establishes a Board of Inquiry to address labor disputes in the maritime industry. It invokes the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947. The document itself doesn't directly express ideological preferences, immigration stances, or promote specific social values. It seems primarily focused on resolving a labor dispute that affects national health and safety. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The executive power is slightly expanded as the president is creating a board.",
