    "critique": "This executive order aims to improve transparency and fairness in federal criminal law by ensuring individuals have notice of potential criminal liability for regulatory violations. It emphasizes focusing criminal enforcement on culpable individuals and encourages agencies to consider administrative or civil enforcement for strict liability offenses. The order promotes regulatory transparency by requiring agencies to explicitly state mens rea requirements or identify strict liability offenses in proposed and final rules. It also directs agencies to publish guidance on administratively addressing regulatory offenses rather than referring them for criminal enforcement. The order includes several exceptions, such as actions related to foreign or military affairs, national security, criminal investigations, and certain types of goods. It also states that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits. \n\nIdeological Tilt: The order's emphasis on fairness, transparency, and limiting criminal penalties for unintentional violations aligns with principles of due process and individual liberty, which can be seen as having both liberal and conservative aspects. However, the focus on reducing regulatory burdens and limiting government intervention in cases of unintentional violations leans slightly conservative. Score: -1\n\nImmigration Approach: This order does not directly address immigration. Score: 0\n\nExecutive Power: The order directs agencies to take certain actions and consult with the Office of Management and Budget, but it also includes provisions that limit its application in certain circumstances. It does not appear to significantly expand or restrict executive power. Score: 0\n\nFederalism: The order primarily affects federal agencies and their enforcement of federal regulations. It does not appear to significantly shift power between the federal government and the states. Score: 0\n\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The order aims to protect individuals from unwarranted criminal punishment for unintentional violations of regulations, which aligns with civil liberties. However, it also includes exceptions for actions related to national security, suggesting a balanced approach. Score: -1\n\nEconomic Regulation: The order seeks to alleviate regulatory burdens on Americans by ensuring they have notice of potential criminal liability for violations of regulations. This suggests a move towards deregulation. Score: -1\n\nSocial Inclusion: The order does not directly address social inclusion issues. Score: 0",
