    "critique": "This executive order from 1943 mandates the use of Social Security numbers as a standard identifier across federal agencies. It aims for administrative efficiency and cost savings by avoiding the creation of multiple identification systems. There's an emphasis on maintaining confidentiality of personal information. It doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties vs. national security, or social inclusion. It centralizes data management at the federal level. It doesn't seem to obviously expand executive power. It has a slight interventionist economic impact, but mostly focuses on efficiency. It is slightly conservative in the sense that it is standardizing and streamlining existing systems.",
