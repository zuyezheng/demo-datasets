    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to act on behalf of the United States in bankruptcy proceedings. It pertains to the implementation of bankruptcy law and the representation of US interests in such cases. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The economic regulation axis might lean slightly towards intervention, as bankruptcy laws themselves are a form of government intervention in the economy, but it's a very indirect effect.",
