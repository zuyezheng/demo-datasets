    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between airlines and their employees. It seems to be a fairly neutral action, intervening in a labor dispute to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. It doesn't strongly lean in any particular ideological direction. It doesn't deal with immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has a slight intervention in economic regulation.",
