    "critique": "This document extends the deadline for a report from the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism. It does not seem to have strong implications for any of the axes. The extension itself doesn't inherently expand executive power, change immigration, affect federalism, alter the balance between security and liberty, regulate the economy, or impact social inclusion. The ideological tilt is also neutral, as aviation security can be a concern across the political spectrum.",
