    "critique": "This document is a waiver regarding trade relations with Turkmenistan. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt based on this document alone. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The waiver suggests a move towards facilitating trade, which could have economic implications, but it's not a direct regulation or deregulation. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral.",
