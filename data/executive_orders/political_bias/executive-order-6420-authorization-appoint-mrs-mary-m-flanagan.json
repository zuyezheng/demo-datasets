    "critique": "This document is a simple executive order regarding a specific appointment. It waives civil service rules for a specific individual to be appointed as a charwoman. This seems to be a very specific and limited action. There's no indication of broad ideological leaning, immigration policy, or significant impact on executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards expanding executive power, as it is an executive order that waives existing rules, but this is very minor.",
