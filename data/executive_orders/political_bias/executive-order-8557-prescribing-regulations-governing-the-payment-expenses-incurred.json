    "critique": "This document is an executive order prescribing regulations for the payment of expenses related to the remains, families, and effects of officers and employees dying abroad or in travel status. It primarily deals with logistical and financial matters, outlining permissible expenses and procedures for transporting remains, dependents, and personal property. There's little to suggest a strong ideological leaning. It doesn't touch on immigration, civil liberties, or economic regulation in any significant way. The order centralizes control in the federal government, as it dictates how federal departments should handle these expenses. There is no mention of social issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight lean towards federal control.",
