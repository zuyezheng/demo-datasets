    "critique": "The document is an announcement from a president regarding limitations on interviews and meetings, primarily due to the overwhelming number of applications for office. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only area where it has a slight impact is on executive power, as it's a decision by the president to manage their time and access, which could be seen as a minor assertion of executive authority in managing the office. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards neutral on executive power.",
