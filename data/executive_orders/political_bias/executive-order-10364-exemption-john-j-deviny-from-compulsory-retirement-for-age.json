    "critique": "This is an executive order that exempts John J. Deviny, the Public Printer, from compulsory retirement. It does not seem to have any ideological tilt. It does not relate to immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power, but only very slightly, as it is a specific exemption based on existing law. It does not relate to federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
