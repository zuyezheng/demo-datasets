    "critique": "The document is a straightforward administrative action, adding a position to Schedule A of positions excepted from civil service examination. This action itself doesn't inherently lean liberal or conservative. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The action could be seen as slightly expanding executive power by allowing the Farm Board members to appoint staff without examination, but this is a very minor effect.",
