    "critique": "This document establishes the Kenai National Moose Range in Alaska. It withdraws land for the use of the Department of the Interior and the Alaska Game Commission as a refuge and breeding ground for moose. It restricts settlement and other disposition of land, but allows hunting and trapping in accordance with the Alaska Game Law. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It does not deal with immigration. It expands executive power by withdrawing land. It favors federal control by establishing a national range. It balances national security and civil liberties by allowing hunting and trapping. It intervenes in the economy by restricting land use. It promotes conformity by restricting settlement.",
