    "critique": "The document is a directive from President Hoover to the Secretary of Agriculture regarding plant patents. It outlines the support the Department of Agriculture will provide to the Commissioner of Patents in implementing the Plant Patent Act. The document itself doesn't express strong opinions on the axes, but some assumptions can be made. It seems to expand executive power as it is a directive from the president. It also seems to promote federal control as it involves a federal act and the coordination between federal departments.",
