    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a labor dispute between railway carriers and their employees. It aims to prevent interruption of interstate commerce by maintaining the status quo for a limited time. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, or social inclusion policies. The executive power is somewhat expanded to create the board, but it's a temporary measure within the bounds of the Railway Labor Act. Federalism isn't directly addressed, and the document seems neutral on national security vs. civil liberties. Economic regulation is indirectly involved by preventing changes to existing conditions, but it's not a strong intervention. Therefore, most scores should be close to neutral.",
