    "critique": "This document approves a code of fair competition for the Marking Devices Industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933. It establishes a code authority with industry representatives and members appointed by the Administrator. The document reflects interventionist economic policies typical of the New Deal era. There is no direct impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is moderately liberal due to the interventionist economic policies.",
