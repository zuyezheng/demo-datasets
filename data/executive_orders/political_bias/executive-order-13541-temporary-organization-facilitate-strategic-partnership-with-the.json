    "critique": "The document establishes a temporary organization (ISPO) within the Department of State to facilitate the strategic partnership between the U.S. and Iraq. It focuses on transitioning to a strategic partnership in various fields, assisting with the drawdown of Provincial Reconstruction Teams, supporting a sustainable Rule of Law mission, and completing remaining functions for Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund monies. The order emphasizes adherence to applicable law and presidential guidance, and it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits. The ISPO will terminate at the end of the maximum period permitted by law unless sooner terminated by the Secretary.",
