    "critique": "This document is an executive order from Franklin D. Roosevelt approving a Code of Fair Competition for the Optical Manufacturing Industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933. This act was a key component of the New Deal, a series of programs and projects instituted during the Great Depression with the goal of restoring prosperity to Americans. The document reflects a strong interventionist approach to the economy, typical of the New Deal era. It also centralizes power in the federal government, specifically the executive branch, to regulate industry. There is no direct mention of immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion in this particular document, so those axes will be scored as neutral. The ideological tilt is towards liberal, given the interventionist economic policies.",
