    "critique": "This document is an executive order that transfers land in Missouri to the Department of the Interior to be used as a wildlife refuge. It also allows the University of Missouri to continue using the land for research purposes. The order references several acts of Congress, including the National Industrial Recovery Act, the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act, and the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. It does not appear to have a strong ideological tilt, as it is primarily focused on land conservation and utilization. It does not address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes should be neutral.",
