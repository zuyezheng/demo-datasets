    "critique": "This document is a directive to close government departments for a day of remembrance for soldiers who died during the Civil War. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. The only possible exception might be social inclusion, where one could argue that remembering fallen soldiers promotes a sense of national unity, but this is a very weak argument.",
