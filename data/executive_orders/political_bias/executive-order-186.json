    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the administration and collection of customs on the Island of Guam. It delegates authority to a Naval officer to act as Collector of Customs and clarifies the scope of this authority, including the power to appoint a deputy. The document does not directly address ideological issues, immigration policies, or civil liberties. It has a slight impact on federalism by centralizing customs authority under a federal officer, but this is specific to Guam. There is a minor economic regulation aspect related to customs collection. Social inclusion is not directly addressed. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with slight adjustments for federalism and economic regulation.",
