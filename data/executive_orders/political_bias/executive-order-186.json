    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on the delegation of customs authority in Guam to a Naval officer, with provisions for appointing a deputy and ensuring proper security. It ratifies previous exercises of this authority. There is minimal to no discussion of broader political or social issues, so most axes should be close to neutral. The exception might be executive power, which is slightly expanded.",
