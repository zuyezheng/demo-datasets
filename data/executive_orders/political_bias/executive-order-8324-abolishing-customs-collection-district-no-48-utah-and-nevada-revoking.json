    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding customs field organization. It abolishes a customs collection district, revokes a port of entry designation, and extends the limits of another district. These actions appear to be primarily administrative and do not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's a slight shift towards federal control as it consolidates districts, but it's minimal.",
