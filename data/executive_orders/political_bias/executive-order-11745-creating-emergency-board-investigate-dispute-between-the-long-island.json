    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a labor dispute between the Long Island Rail Road and its employees. It is a fairly neutral action, intervening in a labor dispute to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. There's no strong indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, or shift in federalism. It seems to balance national security (preventing disruption of transportation) with the rights of workers and the company. There's a slight intervention in economic regulation by preventing changes to the conditions out of which the dispute arose, but it's temporary. There's no clear impact on social inclusion.",
