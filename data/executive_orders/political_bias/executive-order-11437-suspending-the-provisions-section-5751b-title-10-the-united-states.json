    "critique": "This document is a short executive order. It suspends a provision of title 10 of the US code and revokes three other executive orders. Because it is short and technical, it is difficult to assess its ideological tilt. Because it suspends a provision and revokes three other executive orders, it likely expands executive power. Because it deals with US code, it likely involves federalism. Because it is short and technical, it is difficult to assess its impact on national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion.",
