    "critique": "This document pertains to the classification and civil service rules within free-delivery post offices. It extends existing classifications to all free-delivery post offices and mandates civil service examinations for filling vacancies. It also requires reporting revisions of classifications to the President. Given the nature of the document, it has a moderate impact on most axes. It has a slight impact favoring federalism, economic regulation, and social inclusion due to the standardization and civil service requirements.",
