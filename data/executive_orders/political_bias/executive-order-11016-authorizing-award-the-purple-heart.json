    "critique": "This executive order concerns the awarding of the Purple Heart medal. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It delegates authority to the Secretaries of military departments, maintaining a balance between federal and departmental control. It focuses on honoring military service and sacrifice, with no apparent impact on civil liberties or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
