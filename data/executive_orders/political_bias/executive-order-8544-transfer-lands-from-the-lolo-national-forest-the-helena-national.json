    "critique": "This document pertains to the transfer of land between two national forests in Montana. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, or civil liberties. Its primary focus is on land management and federalism, specifically the delineation of boundaries between national forests. There is a slight impact on federalism, as it reaffirms federal control over these lands. There is no impact on economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
