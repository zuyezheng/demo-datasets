    "critique": "This document establishes a reservation for the Northern Cheyenne tribe. It withdraws land from sale and settlement for their permanent use. This suggests a focus on social inclusion for Native Americans. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or economic regulation. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the protection of indigenous land rights.",
