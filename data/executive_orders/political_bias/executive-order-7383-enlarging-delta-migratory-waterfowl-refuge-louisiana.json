    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the reservation of land for a migratory waterfowl refuge. It does not directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The action of reserving land could be seen as a very slight intervention, but it's primarily for conservation.",
