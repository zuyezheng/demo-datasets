It delegates authority to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (or the Civil Service Commission until the OPM is established). There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
