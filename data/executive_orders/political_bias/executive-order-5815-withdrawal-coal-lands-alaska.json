    "critique": "This document is an executive order from Herbert Hoover withdrawing land from settlement for investigation and classification. It's a fairly neutral action in terms of modern political issues. It doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it also explicitly allows for revocation by Congress, which balances that. It could be seen as moderate regulation.",
