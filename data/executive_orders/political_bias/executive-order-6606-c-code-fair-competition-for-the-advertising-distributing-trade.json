    "critique": "This document is an executive order approving a Code of Fair Competition for the Advertising Distributing Trade under the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933. \n\nIdeological Tilt: The NIRA was a New Deal program, so it leans liberal due to government intervention in the economy. Score: 3\nImmigration Approach: The document doesn't address immigration. Score: 0\nExecutive Power: The document is an executive order, but it's implementing existing legislation (NIRA), not necessarily expanding executive power beyond what was already granted. Score: 0\nFederalism: The NIRA increased federal power over the economy, so this leans towards federal primacy. Score: 3\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The document doesn't directly address national security or civil liberties. Score: 0\nEconomic Regulation: The NIRA was a major intervention in the economy, so this is heavy regulation. Score: 4\nSocial Inclusion: The document includes provisions about child labor, which could be seen as a very mild form of social protection, but it's primarily about economic regulation. Score: 1",
