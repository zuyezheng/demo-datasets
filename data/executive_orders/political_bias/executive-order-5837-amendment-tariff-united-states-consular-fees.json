    "critique": "This document waives fees for certifying copies of American origin certificates to promote US exports. This seems economically interventionist to a small degree as it is a government action intended to influence trade, but it's also supportive of American businesses. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power shift, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
