It rescinds a previous order on the same topic and lays out specific guidelines for punctuation, spelling, land descriptions, and formatting. It also specifies the process for submitting and reviewing these documents. There's nothing in this document that touches on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is neutral, as it's purely administrative.",
