    "critique": "This document pertains to the withdrawal of public lands in Wyoming from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. It cites specific acts of Congress as its authority. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power expansion, or impacts on national security vs. civil liberties. The action seems related to land management and resource control, which could have some economic implications but not in a strongly regulatory or deregulatory way. There's no clear impact on social inclusion either. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
