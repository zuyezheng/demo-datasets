    "critique": "This executive order prohibits the importation of South African Krugerrands. This was part of a broader effort to put economic pressure on South Africa to end apartheid. \n\n1.  Ideological Tilt: This is difficult to place on a traditional left-right spectrum. However, given that it is promoting human rights and opposing racial discrimination, I will give it a +2.\n2.  Immigration Approach: This executive order does not directly relate to immigration.\n3.  Executive Power: The order is issued under the authority of the President and relies on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, suggesting an expansion of executive power. I will give it a +2.\n4.  Federalism: This is a federal action, so it leans towards federal control. I will give it a +1.\n5.  National Security vs. Civil Liberties: This order does not directly relate to national security or civil liberties.\n6.  Economic Regulation: This is a trade restriction, so it is a form of economic intervention. I will give it a +2.\n7.  Social Inclusion: This order promotes social inclusion by opposing apartheid. I will give it a +4.\n\nRevised Scores:\nI will revise the executive power score to 0, as the order is not expanding executive power in a general sense, but rather using existing authority to address a specific issue. The other scores seem appropriate.",
