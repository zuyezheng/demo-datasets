    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1937 limiting the quantity of red cedar shingles imported from Canada. It is based on Section 811 of the Revenue Act of 1936 and a reciprocal trade agreement with Canada. The order sets a quota for the last six months of 1937 based on the combined shipments and imports of red cedar shingles during the first half of the year. There is no direct discussion of social issues, civil liberties, or executive power beyond the act of setting import quotas as authorized by existing legislation.",
