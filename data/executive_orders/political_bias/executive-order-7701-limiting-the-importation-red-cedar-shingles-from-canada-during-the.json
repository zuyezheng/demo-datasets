    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1937 that limits the quantity of red cedar shingles imported from Canada. It is based on Section 811 of the Revenue Act of 1936 and a reciprocal trade agreement with Canada. The order limits imports to 25% of the combined total of shipments and imports from the previous half-calendar year. This is a trade regulation and doesn't directly address social issues or civil liberties. It has some implications for economic regulation and international trade.",
