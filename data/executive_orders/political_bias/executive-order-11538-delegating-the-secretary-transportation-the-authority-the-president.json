    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of Transportation regarding an International Aeronautical Exposition. It's primarily administrative in nature. There's no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It doesn't significantly expand executive power, as it's simply delegating existing authority. It doesn't directly address federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
