    "critique": "This document establishes the authority of Lieutenant Colonel Lewis B. Hershey to administer the Selective Service Act of 1940, including appointing members of local boards and appeal boards. It is a wartime measure focused on national security. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, or social inclusion. The executive power is expanded to implement the Selective Service Act. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government takes control of conscription. National security is prioritized over individual liberties in the context of military conscription. Economic regulation is not directly addressed, but the draft has economic implications. There is no direct impact on social inclusion.",
