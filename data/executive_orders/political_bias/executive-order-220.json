It directs the closure of the Navy Department, the display of flags at half-mast, and the suspension of business to allow Navy personnel to participate in public expressions of national sorrow. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism concerns, national security vs. civil liberties considerations, economic regulation aspects, or social inclusion matters. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
