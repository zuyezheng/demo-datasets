    "critique": "This document revokes two executive orders. Executive Order No. 12818 prohibited project agreements on Federal construction contracts, which likely reduced union power and potentially lowered costs for federal projects. Executive Order No. 12800 required Federal contractors to post a notice that workers are not required to join unions, which is also anti-union. Revoking these orders likely favors unions and could lead to increased costs for federal construction projects. This suggests a liberal ideological tilt and interventionist economic regulation. The document doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion, so those scores should be neutral. The revocation of the order requiring federal contractors to post a notice that workers are not required to join unions promotes social inclusion for union workers.",
