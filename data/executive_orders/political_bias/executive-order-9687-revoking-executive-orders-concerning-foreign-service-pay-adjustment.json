    "critique": "This document is an executive order that revokes previous executive orders related to the payment of losses sustained by US officers, enlisted men, and employees serving in foreign countries due to currency appreciation. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation in a general sense, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The revocation itself doesn't inherently expand or restrict executive power, but rather adjusts existing policy within a specific domain.",
