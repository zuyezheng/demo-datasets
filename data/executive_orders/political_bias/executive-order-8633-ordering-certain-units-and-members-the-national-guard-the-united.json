    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1941 ordering National Guard units into active military service. It was issued in the lead-up to World War II. Given the context, several axes can be scored. Ideological Tilt is neutral as it is a military order. Immigration is not relevant. Executive Power is somewhat expanded as it is a presidential order mobilizing troops, but it is based on existing legislation, so it is not a huge expansion. Federalism leans towards federal control as the National Guard is being federalized. National Security is prioritized over civil liberties due to the wartime context. Economic Regulation is not relevant. Social Inclusion is neutral.",
