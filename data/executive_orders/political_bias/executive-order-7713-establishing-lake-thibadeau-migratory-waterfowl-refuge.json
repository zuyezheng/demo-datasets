    "critique": "This executive order establishes a migratory bird refuge. It withdraws land from settlement to protect wildlife. This has some implications for environmental conservation, but doesn't directly address many of the axes. It doesn't seem to obviously favor either conservatives or liberals, so I'll start with a 0 for ideological tilt. It doesn't deal with immigration at all, so that's a 0. It expands executive power insofar as it sets aside land, but it's a fairly limited action, so I'll put it at 1. It's a federal action, so it leans towards federal primacy, I'll put it at 1. It doesn't directly address national security or civil liberties, so I'll put it at 0. It could be seen as a form of economic regulation, but it's primarily about conservation, so I'll put it at 1. It promotes biodiversity, so I'll put it at 1 for social inclusion.",
