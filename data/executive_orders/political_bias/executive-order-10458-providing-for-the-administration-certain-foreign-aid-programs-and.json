    "critique": "This executive order primarily deals with the transfer of functions and responsibilities related to international development and mutual security from the Secretary of State and the Department of State to the Director for Mutual Security. It also addresses participation in international organizations and ocean freight charges on relief supplies. There's no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
