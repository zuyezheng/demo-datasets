    "critique": "This executive order establishes a committee to monitor and assess the work of the International Labor Organization (ILO). It includes members from various government departments and representatives from labor and business organizations. The order delegates administrative functions to the Secretary of Labor and sets a termination date for the committee. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It seems fairly centrist in nature. The order doesn't directly address immigration. The order doesn't dramatically expand executive power, but it does create a committee and delegate authority to the Secretary of Labor, so it is slightly expansionary. The order doesn't significantly impact federalism. The order doesn't directly address national security or civil liberties. The order doesn't directly regulate the economy, but it does involve the government in international labor standards, so it is slightly interventionist. The order doesn't directly address social inclusion, but the inclusion of the AFL-CIO could be seen as slightly promoting worker's rights.",
