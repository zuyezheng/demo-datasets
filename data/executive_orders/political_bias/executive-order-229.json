    "critique": "This document is a proclamation to close Executive Departments and the Government Printing Office on a Saturday to allow employees to participate in decorating the graves of soldiers and sailors who died defending the Union during the Civil War. Given the historical context, this document does not directly address contemporary political issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document does not obviously lean liberal or conservative, nor does it address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that allows for a clear bias assessment. Therefore, the initial scores are mostly zero.",
