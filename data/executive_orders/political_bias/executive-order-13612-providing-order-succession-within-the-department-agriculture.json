    "critique": "This document establishes the order of succession within the Department of Agriculture. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by defining the line of succession, but this is a routine administrative function. It has no impact on federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
