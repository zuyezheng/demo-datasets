    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding land use in New Mexico. It revokes a previous order and temporarily withdraws land for use by the Forest Service. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, or impact on civil liberties. It centralizes control of land in the federal government, has no impact on economic regulation, and does not address social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:\n\nIdeological Tilt: 0\nImmigration Approach: 0\nExecutive Power: 0\nFederalism: 3\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0\nEconomic Regulation: 0\nSocial Inclusion: 0\n\nUpon further reflection, the act of withdrawing land for federal use does represent a slight expansion of executive power, as it allows the President to control land use. The federalism score is appropriate as it clearly favors federal control over state control. The other scores remain unchanged as the document does not directly address those issues.",
