    "critique": "The document delegates authority to the Secretary of Agriculture regarding specific industries under the National Industrial Recovery Act. This suggests government intervention in the economy. The delegation of power itself doesn't inherently expand executive power, as it's within the bounds of the Act. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism implications, national security concerns, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most axes should be neutral, with a slight lean towards government intervention in economic regulation.",
