    "critique": "This document is a land transfer between the US Department of Agriculture and the Territory of Hawaii. It restores land to the Territory of Hawaii for use as home sites for the people of Hawaii. There is no clear ideological tilt, immigration policy, or impact on civil liberties. It shifts control from the federal government to the territory, indicating a move towards state control. There's no indication of economic regulation or social inclusion policies. Therefore, most axes should be neutral, with a slight negative score for federalism.",
