    "critique": "This document pertains to land use in Alaska, specifically modifying a previous executive order to allow entry under certain provisions for a tract of land known as the old town of Kodiak. Given the limited scope and focus on land management, the document has minimal implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral.",
