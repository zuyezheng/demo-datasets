    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1937 that limits the importation of red cedar shingles from Canada. It is based on a provision in the Revenue Act of 1936. The order is protectionist in nature, aiming to protect the US red cedar shingle industry. It does not directly address social issues or civil liberties. It is difficult to place on a left-right spectrum. Immigration is impacted, but only with respect to shingles. Executive power is being exercised as authorized by the Revenue Act of 1936, so it is hard to say whether it expands executive power. Federalism is not really impacted. National security is not impacted. Economic regulation is impacted in that the order intervenes in the market to protect a domestic industry. Social inclusion is not impacted.",
