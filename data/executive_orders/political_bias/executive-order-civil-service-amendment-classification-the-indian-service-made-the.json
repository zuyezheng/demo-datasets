    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the classification of positions within the Indian service. It directs the Secretary of the Interior to revise the classification to include assistant teachers in class 3. There is not enough information to determine its stance on ideological tilt, immigration, security vs liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It seems to expand executive power by directing the Secretary of Interior. It also seems to consolidate power at the federal level by directing a federal employee.",
