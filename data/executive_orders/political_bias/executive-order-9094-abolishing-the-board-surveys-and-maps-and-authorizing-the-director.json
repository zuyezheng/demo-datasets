    "critique": "This executive order is about reorganizing the Federal Board of Surveys and Maps. It abolishes the board and transfers its functions to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget. There's nothing inherently ideological about surveying and mapping, so the ideological tilt is neutral. The order doesn't deal with immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes should also be neutral.",
