    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding land withdrawal in Colorado pending a resurvey. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, or civil liberties. It touches on federalism by exerting federal control over public lands within a state. Economic regulation and social inclusion are not relevant here. Therefore, most scores will be neutral, with a slight lean towards federal control.",
