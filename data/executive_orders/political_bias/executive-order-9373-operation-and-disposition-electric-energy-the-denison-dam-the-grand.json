    "critique": "This executive order consolidates control of several dam projects under the Secretary of the Interior. It prioritizes the sale of electricity to war plants, public bodies, and cooperatives. The order centralizes power at the federal level and expands the power of the executive branch by giving the Secretary of Interior broad authority over these projects. There is a slight tilt towards government intervention in the economy. There is no clear impact on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The order seems ideologically neutral.",
