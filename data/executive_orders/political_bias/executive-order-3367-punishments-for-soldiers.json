    "critique": "This document outlines the maximum punishments for soldiers under Article of War No. 45. It sets limits on forfeitures of pay, confinement, and dishonorable discharge. It also addresses previous convictions and administrative rules. There is nothing explicitly ideological in this document. It seems to be focused on military justice and internal regulation. Therefore, most of the axes should be neutral. There's a slight lean towards national security, as it pertains to military discipline.",
