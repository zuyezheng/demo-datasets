    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1940 related to certifications for tax purposes concerning contracts with the War and Navy departments. It outlines procedures for contractors to request certifications for special equipment and facilities used in the construction of naval vessels and aircraft during the national emergency declared in 1939. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It involves economic regulation by specifying how costs can be charged against contracts. It delegates authority to the Secretary of War/Navy and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. It seems to expand executive power slightly by prescribing regulations.",
