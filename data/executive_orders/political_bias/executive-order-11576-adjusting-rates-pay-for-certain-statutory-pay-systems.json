    "critique": "This document adjusts the pay scales for federal employees, including those in the General Schedule, Veterans' Administration, and Foreign Service. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The economic regulation aspect is minimal, simply adjusting pay in response to the Federal Pay Comparability Act. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. There's a slight interventionist aspect to adjusting pay scales, but it's minor.",
