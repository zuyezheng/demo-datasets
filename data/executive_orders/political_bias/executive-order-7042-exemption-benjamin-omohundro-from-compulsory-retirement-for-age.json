    "critique": "This is a very specific action, an executive order to allow one particular government employee to continue working past the usual retirement age. It is difficult to extract broad political meaning from such a narrow action. There is no clear ideological tilt, immigration component, or effect on civil liberties. It does give the executive branch more power, but in a very limited way. It does not obviously affect federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
