    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 directing the Secretary of the Treasury to use Coast Guard vessels to aid distressed navigators during severe weather. It seems fairly non-ideological. There's no clear indication of a liberal or conservative stance. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order could be seen as a slight expansion of government intervention to help navigators, but it's a very minor one.",
