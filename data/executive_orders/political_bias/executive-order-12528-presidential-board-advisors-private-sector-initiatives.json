    "critique": "This executive order establishes a Presidential Board of Advisors on Private Sector Initiatives. It aims to increase public awareness of public/private partnerships and strengthen private social service programs. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or federalism. The order itself doesn't seem to expand executive power significantly, as it establishes an advisory board rather than enacting new policies directly. It promotes private sector involvement in social services, which aligns with a conservative approach to economic regulation and social welfare. There is no direct impact on social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores reflect these considerations.",
