It aims to increase public awareness of public/private partnerships and strengthen private social service programs. There is no shift in the traditional left-right political spectrum. The document does not address immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, or social inclusion. It promotes private sector initiatives, suggesting deregulation.",
