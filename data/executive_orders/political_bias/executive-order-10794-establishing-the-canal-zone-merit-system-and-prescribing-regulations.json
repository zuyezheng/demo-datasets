    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the administration of the Canal Zone, focusing on employment standards, a merit system, and an appeals board. It aims for uniform application of standards regardless of citizenship (US or Panamanian) and establishes a merit-based system for employment. The order delegates authority to the Secretary of the Army and emphasizes coordination among departments. It also establishes a Canal Zone Board of Appeals for employees. There's a balance between security concerns (allowing for US citizen-only positions for security reasons) and fair employment practices. It doesn't explicitly expand executive power, but delegates existing authority. It leans towards federal control over the Canal Zone. It promotes a merit system, which can be seen as a move towards social inclusion, but also allows for security-based restrictions based on citizenship.",
