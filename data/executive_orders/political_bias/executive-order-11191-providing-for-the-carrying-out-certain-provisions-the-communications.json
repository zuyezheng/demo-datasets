    "critique": "This document establishes roles and responsibilities for the Director of Telecommunications Management and the Secretary of State in relation to the Communications Satellite Act of 1962. It focuses on the development and operation of a commercial communications satellite system. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It involves government in the development of a communications system, suggesting some economic intervention, but it's not heavy-handed. It centralizes control at the federal level. There is a slight expansion of executive power through delegation of responsibilities.",
