    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between New Jersey Transit Rail Operations and its Locomotive Engineers. It is based on the Railway Labor Act. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, security vs. liberty concerns, or social inclusion. The executive power is somewhat expanded to establish the board, but it is within the bounds of existing law. Federalism is neutral as it involves a federal law applied to a state issue. Economic regulation is slightly present as it prevents changes to the conditions out of which the dispute arose for 120 days.",
