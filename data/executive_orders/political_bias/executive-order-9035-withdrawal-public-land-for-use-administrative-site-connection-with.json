    "critique": "This document pertains to the withdrawal and reservation of public lands in Alaska for the Alaska Road Commission to establish a supply base and repair shop for the Palmer-Richardson highway. It is a straightforward administrative action with minimal ideological content. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The exception might be federalism, where reserving land for a federal commission suggests a slight tilt towards federal control.",
