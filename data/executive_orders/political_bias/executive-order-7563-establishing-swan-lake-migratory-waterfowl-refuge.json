    "critique": "This document establishes a migratory bird refuge. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt as it is primarily a conservation effort. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards federalism as it's a federal action, but it's weak.",
