It primarily deals with the composition of the committee, specifying the roles of various officials and allowing the President to appoint additional members. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion or restriction of executive power, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion/exclusion. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
