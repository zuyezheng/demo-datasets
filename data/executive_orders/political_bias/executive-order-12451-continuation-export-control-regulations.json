    "critique": "This document revokes a previous executive order (12444) and rescinds a declaration of economic emergency. It ensures that existing rules and regulations remain in effect until amended or revoked by the proper authority. The document primarily deals with export controls and the administration of the Arms Export Control Act. It does not directly address social issues, immigration, or civil liberties. Therefore, the scores for these axes should be neutral. The revocation of an economic emergency could be seen as a slight move towards deregulation, but the continuation of existing regulations suggests a balanced approach. The document does not significantly expand or restrict executive power, as it mainly maintains the status quo. It also does not appear to shift power between the federal and state governments.",
