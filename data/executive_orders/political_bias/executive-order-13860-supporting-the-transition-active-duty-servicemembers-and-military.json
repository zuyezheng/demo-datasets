    "critique": "This executive order focuses on supporting military veterans in obtaining merchant mariner credentials, aiming to address a shortage of qualified mariners and bolster national and economic security. It directs the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to streamline credentialing processes, waive fees where possible, and provide resources for service members. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order seems to have a slight tilt towards supporting veterans, which could be seen as a conservative value, but it's primarily focused on workforce development and national security.",
