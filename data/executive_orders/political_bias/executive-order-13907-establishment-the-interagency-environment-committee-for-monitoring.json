    "critique": "The document establishes an interagency committee to monitor and enforce environmental obligations related to trade agreements. It appears to expand executive power through the establishment of this committee and gives the USTR a central role. The document doesn't directly address immigration, security, or social inclusion. It leans towards federal control by creating a federal committee. Economic regulation is addressed indirectly through environmental regulations tied to trade.",
