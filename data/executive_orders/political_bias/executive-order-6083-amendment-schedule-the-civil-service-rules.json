    "critique": "The document discusses amending Schedule A of the Civil Service Rules by adding a new subdivision and paragraph related to the Federal Radio Commission. It specifies the addition of one Secretary of the Federal Radio Commission. The document itself doesn't express strong opinions on the axes, but the creation of a position within a federal commission suggests a slight increase in federal power and potential for economic regulation.",
