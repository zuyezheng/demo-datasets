It does not touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation in a broad sense, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The only exception might be economic regulation, where setting pay scales could be seen as a slight intervention, but it's minimal.",
