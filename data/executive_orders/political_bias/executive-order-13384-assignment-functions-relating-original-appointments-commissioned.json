    "critique": "This document is an executive order from George W. Bush assigning functions to the Secretary of Defense. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that assigning functions to the Secretary of Defense slightly expands executive power, but it also clarifies the limits of that power. Therefore, the initial scores are mostly neutral.",
