    "critique": "This executive order expands the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart medal. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It has a slight tilt towards national security as it concerns military personnel and their service, but also emphasizes that the Purple Heart is not authorized for a wound or death that results from the willful misconduct of the member.",
