    "critique": "This executive order temporarily suspends Civil Service Rules for appointments in government positions funded by the Public Works Administration Appropriation Act of 1938. It's a temporary measure related to a specific program during the New Deal era. Ideologically, it's slightly liberal due to the expansion of government programs during the New Deal. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is slightly expanded to allow appointments without Civil Service Rules. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is managing public works. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly addressed, but the suspension of Civil Service Rules could potentially weaken civil service protections. Economic regulation is interventionist as it relates to public works spending. Social inclusion is not directly addressed.",
