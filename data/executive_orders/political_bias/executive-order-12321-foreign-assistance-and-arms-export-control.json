    "critique": "This document is a technical amendment to previous executive orders, specifically removing and reassigning authority related to sections of the Foreign Assistance Act and the Arms Export Control Act. It does not express a clear ideological stance, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The changes to executive power are very minor and technical, so it should be close to neutral.",
