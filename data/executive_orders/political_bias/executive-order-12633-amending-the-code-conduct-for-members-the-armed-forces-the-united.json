    "critique": "This executive order revises the Code of Conduct for members of the US Armed Forces by removing gender-specific terms. This promotes inclusivity without substantially altering the core principles or operational aspects of the code. The changes are primarily linguistic, updating the language to reflect contemporary values without fundamentally shifting the document's ideological underpinnings or practical implications. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral, with a slight lean towards social inclusion.",
