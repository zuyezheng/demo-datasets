    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the reorganization and transfer of informational functions between government entities following World War II. It establishes and then abolishes the Interim International Information Service and the Office of War Information, transferring their functions and resources to the Department of State, the Bureau of the Budget, and the Department of the Treasury for liquidation. There is little to no discussion of social issues, economic policy, or civil liberties. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral.",
