    "critique": "This document is an executive order that abolishes the National Commission for Industrial Peace. It also revokes two previous executive orders related to the commission. The order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to close the affairs of the commission and complete any remaining functions under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. There is nothing particularly liberal or conservative about abolishing a commission. It doesn't seem to affect immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
