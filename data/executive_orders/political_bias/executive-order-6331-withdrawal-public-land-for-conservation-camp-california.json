    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1933 that withdraws public lands in California for use as a State conservation camp in connection with cooperative Civilian Conservation Corps work. It does not express a clear ideological tilt. It does not relate to immigration. It does not significantly expand executive power, as it is based on existing legislation. It could be seen as slightly favoring federalism, as it involves federal land being used for a state program. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It could be seen as slightly interventionist in the economy, as it involves the government in land use and conservation. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
