It also specifies that the provisions of Title I of the Act shall be applicable to all contracts with each designated agency and related subcontracts, to the extent of the amounts received or accrued by a contractor or subcontractor on or after July 1, 1951. The order itself doesn't express strong opinions on ideological tilt, immigration, or social inclusion. It mainly focuses on economic regulation and executive power.",
