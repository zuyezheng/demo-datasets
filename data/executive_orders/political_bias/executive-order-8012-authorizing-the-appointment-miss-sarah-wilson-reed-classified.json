    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1938 allowing a specific individual to be appointed to a classified position in the Navy Department without following Civil Service Rules. This is based on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy and cites the Civil Service Act. The order is justified by the fact that the individual is the daughter of a retired Navy Department employee who was disabled. The document does not contain sufficient information to assess most of the political bias axes. The only axis that can be reliably assessed is Executive Power.",
