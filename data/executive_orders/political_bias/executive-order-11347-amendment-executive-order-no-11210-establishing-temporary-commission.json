    "critique": "This document amends Executive Order No. 11210, modifying the composition of a commission by adding and specifying members. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The change in commission composition is unlikely to significantly alter the balance of power or policy direction in any of these areas.",
