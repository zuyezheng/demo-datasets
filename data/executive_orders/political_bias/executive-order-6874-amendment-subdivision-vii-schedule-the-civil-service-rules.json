    "critique": "This document pertains to a very specific and temporary modification to civil service rules regarding temporary postal workers during the holiday season in 1934. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt, immigration approach, impact on executive power, or implications for federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. The only axis that seems relevant is economic regulation, where it could be argued that allowing temporary workers is a form of deregulation or flexibility in labor markets, but the effect is minimal. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral (0), with a slight lean towards deregulation (-1) for economic regulation.",
