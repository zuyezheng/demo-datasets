    "critique": "This document is an executive order that returns land from the US government to the Territory of Hawaii. It is a relatively mundane administrative action with little to no impact on the axes of political bias. There is no clear ideological tilt, immigration policy, expansion or restriction of executive power, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, the initial scores should be close to zero across all axes.",
