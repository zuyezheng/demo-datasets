    "critique": "This document delegates authority to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the screening of the Ready Reserve of the Armed Forces. It also revokes Executive Order No. 10651. There is no information to suggest a particular ideological tilt. The document does not address immigration. It delegates power, but it is not clear whether this expands or restricts executive power in a significant way. It does not obviously shift power between the federal and state governments. It relates to national security, but does not obviously prioritize it over civil liberties or vice versa. It does not directly address economic regulation or social inclusion.",
