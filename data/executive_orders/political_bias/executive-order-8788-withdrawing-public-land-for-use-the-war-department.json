    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1941 withdrawing land in Alaska for military purposes during World War II. Given the context of World War II, several axes are impacted. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on a left-right spectrum, so it's likely centrist. Immigration is not relevant. Executive power is expanded, but only slightly, as it's a land withdrawal for military use during wartime. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is taking control of land. National security is prioritized over civil liberties, but again, in the context of wartime. Economic regulation is not directly impacted. Social inclusion is not directly impacted.",
