    "critique": "This executive order establishes a Presidential Transition Coordinating Council to assist major party candidates and the President-elect with the transition between administrations. It aims to facilitate the transfer of information and resources, ensuring a smooth handover of power. The order emphasizes bipartisan cooperation and equal treatment of major party candidates. It does not touch upon immigration, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that establishing a council expands executive power, but it is primarily for coordination and information sharing during a transition, which is a standard function. It also does not obviously favor the federal government over state governments.",
