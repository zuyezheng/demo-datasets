    "critique": "The document pertains to the amendment of Executive Order No. 9139, which established the War Manpower Commission during World War II. The amendment includes a representative of the National Housing Agency and a joint representative of the War Shipping Administration and the Office of Defense Transportation in the commission's membership.
