    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the hiring of family members of US government employees or uniformed service members who have served overseas. It allows them to be appointed non-competitively to positions within the US government under certain conditions. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The order does give the Director of the Office of Personnel Management some authority to create regulations, but this is not a major expansion of executive power.",
