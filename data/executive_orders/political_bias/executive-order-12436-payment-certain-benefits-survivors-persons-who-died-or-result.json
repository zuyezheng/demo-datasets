    "critique": "This executive order directs the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs to administer benefits to surviving spouses and children of those who died in military service. It also directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide information and technical assistance to the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs. The Secretary of Defense is directed to transfer funds to the Veterans' Administration to pay for these benefits. This seems like a fairly standard administrative order. There's nothing particularly ideological about it. It expands executive power slightly in that it directs agencies to take certain actions, but it's not a major expansion. It doesn't really touch on federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It is slightly liberal in that it provides benefits to a specific group of people, but it's not a major shift.",
