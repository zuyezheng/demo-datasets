    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between railway companies and their employees in order to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. It invokes the Railway Labor Act and aims to maintain the status quo during the investigation. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or social inclusion. It could be argued that intervening in a labor dispute expands executive power, but it is also a temporary measure to ensure essential services. The federal government is stepping in to regulate interstate commerce, suggesting a slight increase in federal power. There is a balance between maintaining economic stability and workers' rights, so it's not strongly skewed towards either. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
