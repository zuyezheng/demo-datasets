    "critique": "This executive order establishes the role of the Executive Director of the Domestic Council in assisting the President with inter-governmental relations. It aims to improve coordination and communication between federal, state, and local governments. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. The order doesn't directly address immigration. It could be argued that improving intergovernmental relations could lead to more efficient use of resources, but this is not a primary focus. The order centralizes power in the Executive Office by tasking the Domestic Council with intergovernmental relations. The order does not directly address national security or civil liberties. The order does not directly address economic regulation. The order does not directly address social inclusion.",
