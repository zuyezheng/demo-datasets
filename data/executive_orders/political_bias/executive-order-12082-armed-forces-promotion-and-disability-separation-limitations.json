It temporarily suspends restrictions on promotions within the Navy and Marine Corps, including those related to promotion zones, service time in grade, and sea/foreign service requirements. It also makes effective conditions for disability retirement and separation based on the percentage and origin of the disability. The order revokes previous executive orders on the same subject.",
