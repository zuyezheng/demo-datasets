    "critique": "This document amends Chapter XXII of the Foreign Service Regulations of the United States. It appears to concern the duties and responsibilities of Foreign Service officers. The changes involve inserting an exception for consular agents and substituting 'Attorney General' for 'Secretary of Labor'. These changes seem administrative in nature and do not directly address the core axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
