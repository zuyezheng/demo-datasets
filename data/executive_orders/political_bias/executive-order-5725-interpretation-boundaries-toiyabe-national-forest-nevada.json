    "critique": "This document pertains to a minor adjustment of the Toiyabe National Forest boundaries in Nevada based on recent surveys. It cites the authority of the act of June 4, 1897, and the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power expansion, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis with a slight lean is federalism, as it involves a federal decision regarding federal land, but it's a very minor adjustment.",
