    "critique": "This document is an executive order withdrawing public lands in Alaska from settlement, location, sale, entry, or other form of appropriation, and reserved for classification, to conserve the public interests, and in aid of such legislation as may hereafter be proposed or recommended. This seems like a fairly neutral action with regards to ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. It does lean towards federalism as it is a federal action impacting lands.",
