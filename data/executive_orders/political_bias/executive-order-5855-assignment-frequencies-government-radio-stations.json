    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1932 by President Herbert Hoover regarding the allocation of radio frequencies to government stations. It outlines principles for frequency allocation, encourages the utilization of existing communication facilities, and promotes government encouragement to private radio enterprises. It also allows for experimental operation of government radio stations on frequencies not previously assigned. The document does not directly address ideological tilts, immigration, or social inclusion. It expands executive power to allocate radio frequencies and potentially control radio stations during emergencies. It centralizes control over radio frequencies at the federal level. It balances national security with the encouragement of private radio enterprises. It involves government in economic matters by allocating frequencies and setting principles for their use.",
