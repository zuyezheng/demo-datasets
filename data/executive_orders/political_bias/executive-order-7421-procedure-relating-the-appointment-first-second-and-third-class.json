    "critique": "This executive order from 1936 outlines the procedure for filling postmaster vacancies. It prioritizes civil service rules and merit-based appointments, with some preferences for veterans. There's a slight tilt towards regulated processes (economic regulation) due to the emphasis on civil service examinations and age limits. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a significant way, or social inclusion beyond veteran preferences. Federalism isn't a major factor, as it deals with federal positions. National security vs. civil liberties isn't directly relevant, though veteran preference could be seen as a nod to national service. Ideologically, it's fairly neutral, focusing on efficient administration within the existing framework.",
