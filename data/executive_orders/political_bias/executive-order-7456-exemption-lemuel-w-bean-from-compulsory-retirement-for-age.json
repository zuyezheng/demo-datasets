    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1936 that allows one customs agent to continue in his position past the retirement age. This is a very specific action that does not have broad implications. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion based on this document. The only axis that seems relevant is executive power. The document does expand executive power slightly, as it allows the President to make an exception to a law. However, the law itself already provides for this exception, so the expansion is minimal.",
