    "critique": "This document revokes previous executive orders related to phosphate reserves in Idaho. It's a simple revocation with no clear ideological slant. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation in a significant way, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
