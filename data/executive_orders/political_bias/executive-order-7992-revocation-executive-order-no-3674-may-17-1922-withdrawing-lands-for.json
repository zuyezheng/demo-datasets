    "critique": "This document revokes a previous executive order that withdrew lands for the use of a rifle club. This action itself doesn't strongly indicate a position on any of the axes. It could be argued that revoking the order is slightly conservative in the sense that it reduces government involvement, but the effect is minimal. It does not touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
