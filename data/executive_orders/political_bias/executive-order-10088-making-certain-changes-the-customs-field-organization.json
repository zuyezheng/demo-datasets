    "critique": "This document is an executive order that changes customs field organization. It designates Neah Bay, Washington, as a customs port of entry; revokes the designation of Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, as a customs port of entry; changes the name of the customs port of entry of Sonoyta, Arizona, to \"Lukeville, Arizona\"; and extends the limits of the customs port of entry of Lawrence, Massachusetts. These actions do not directly relate to ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
