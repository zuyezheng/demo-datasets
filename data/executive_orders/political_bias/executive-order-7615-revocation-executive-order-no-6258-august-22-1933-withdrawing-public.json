    "critique": "This document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in New Mexico. It's a very specific action related to land management and resurveying. There's no indication of broad ideological stances, immigration policies, executive power grabs, or shifts in federalism. It doesn't touch upon national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
