    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's Economic Policy Advisory Board. It aims to advise the President on domestic and international economic policy. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It could be argued that establishing such a board expands executive power slightly, but it also relies on existing legal frameworks like the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The impact on federalism is neutral, as it doesn't shift power between state and federal entities. The economic regulation aspect is also neutral, as the board's advice could lean in either direction depending on its composition and the prevailing economic conditions. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight positive score for executive power.",
