    "critique": "The document expands the scope of Schedule A, Subdivision III, paragraph 12 to include assistant national bank examiners and assistant receivers under the office of the Comptroller of the Currency. This could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, as it gives the Comptroller of the Currency more flexibility in hiring and managing personnel. There is no clear indication of bias regarding other factors.",
