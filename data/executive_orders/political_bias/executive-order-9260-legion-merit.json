    "critique": "This document establishes rules for awarding the Legion of Merit. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It delegates authority to the Secretary of War and Navy, but ultimately the President approves awards, suggesting a balance in executive power. It doesn't explicitly favor states or the federal government. It focuses on meritorious conduct in service, implying a national security aspect, but doesn't infringe on civil liberties. It promotes inclusion by recognizing service from multiple nations. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards national security and social inclusion.",
