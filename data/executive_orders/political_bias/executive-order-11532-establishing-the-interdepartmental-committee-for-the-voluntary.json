    "critique": "This document is an executive order promoting the purchase of US Savings Bonds through a voluntary payroll savings plan for federal employees. It establishes an Inter-departmental Committee to oversee and promote this plan. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It encourages savings, which could be seen as fiscally conservative, but it also involves government in promoting this, which could be seen as interventionist. Immigration is not mentioned. It could be argued that establishing a committee expands executive power, but it is a relatively minor expansion. It does not shift power between state and federal governments. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It encourages economic activity but does not regulate it in a strong way. It does not directly address social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to neutral.",
