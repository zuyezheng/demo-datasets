    "critique": "This document is an executive order that suspends limitations on punishments for certain offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for those under the command of the Commander in Chief, Far East. This was during the Korean War. It does not obviously relate to ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It arguably expands executive power, but only in a very limited sense related to military justice during wartime. It arguably leans towards national security over civil liberties, but again in a limited wartime context.",
