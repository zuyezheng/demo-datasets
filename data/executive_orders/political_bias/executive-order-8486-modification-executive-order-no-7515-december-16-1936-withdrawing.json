It modifies a previous order to allow the Secretary of Interior to withdraw public land for use by the Civil Aeronautics Authority. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
