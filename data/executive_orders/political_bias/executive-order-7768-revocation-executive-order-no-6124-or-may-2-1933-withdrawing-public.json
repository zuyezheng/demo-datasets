    "critique": "This document concerns the revocation of Executive Order No. 6124 regarding public lands in Colorado pending a resurvey. It invokes the authority vested in the President by the acts of June 25, 1910, and August 24, 1912. The order becomes effective upon the official filing of resurvey plats. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
