    "critique": "This document is a short executive order regarding an appointment to the Secret Service. It waives civil service rules for the appointment of August A. Gennerich. Given the limited information, it's challenging to assess its impact on most axes. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Ideological Tilt:** (0) - The document itself doesn't express a clear ideological stance. It's a procedural matter related to a specific appointment.\n*   **Immigration Approach:** (0) - The document has no bearing on immigration policies.\n*   **Executive Power:** (0) - While it waives civil service rules, it's a specific case and doesn't necessarily indicate a broad expansion of executive power. It could be argued that waiving rules expands power, but without more context, it's difficult to say.\n*   **Federalism:** (0) - The document doesn't directly affect the balance between state and federal power.\n*   **National Security vs. Civil Liberties:** (0) - Waiving civil service rules could potentially impact the quality of the appointment, but it's not a direct threat to civil liberties. It could be argued that it weakens the merit system, but that's not explicit.\n*   **Economic Regulation:** (0) - The document has no impact on economic regulation.\n*   **Social Inclusion:** (0) - The document doesn't address social inclusion or diversity.\n\nGiven the lack of clear indicators, a score of 0 is assigned to most axes. However, the waiver of civil service rules could be interpreted as a slight expansion of executive power, so I will revise that score to 1.\n",
