    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1935 exempting a specific person from mandatory retirement. It's a fairly narrow action. Ideologically, it's hard to place, as it doesn't touch on major left-right issues. Immigration, security, and social inclusion are not relevant. It does expand executive power slightly by using the exemption clause. It doesn't seem to affect federalism. It has a very minor impact on economic regulation by allowing an expert to continue working.",
