    "critique": "This document is an executive order that extends the exemption of Louis A. Simon, Supervising Architect of the Public Buildings Administration, from compulsory retirement for age. It cites the authority vested in the president by section 204 of the act of June 30, 1932. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that seems relevant is executive power, and even there, it's a minor extension based on existing law.",
