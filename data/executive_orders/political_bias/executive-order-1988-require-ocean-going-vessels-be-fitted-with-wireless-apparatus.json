    "critique": "This executive order mandates radio equipment on ships leaving the Canal Zone. \n\n1. Ideological Tilt: This is a safety regulation, not inherently liberal or conservative. Score: 0\n2. Immigration Approach: The order doesn't directly address immigration. Score: 0\n3. Executive Power: The order establishes a new regulation with penalties, expanding executive power in the Canal Zone. Score: 3\n4. Federalism: The order is specific to the Canal Zone, implying federal control over the area. Score: 4\n5. National Security vs. Civil Liberties: The order promotes safety at sea, potentially aiding in communication during emergencies. It doesn't obviously infringe on civil liberties. Score: 2\n6. Economic Regulation: The order imposes a requirement on ships, representing a form of economic regulation. Score: 3\n7. Social Inclusion: The order is neutral on social inclusion. Score: 0\n\nRevised Scores:\nI slightly adjusted the executive power score to reflect that while it does expand executive power, it is within a limited scope (Canal Zone).",
