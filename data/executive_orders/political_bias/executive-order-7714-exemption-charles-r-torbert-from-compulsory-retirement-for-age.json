    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1937 exempting a specific individual from mandatory retirement. It's a very specific action with limited scope. It doesn't touch on broad ideological themes, immigration, or civil liberties. It has a slight impact on executive power, as it uses existing authority to make an exception. It doesn't really affect federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
