    "critique": "This document is a simple authorization for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to adopt an official seal. It's based on the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935. There's very little here to analyze for political bias. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power in any significant way, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only possible angle is a slight lean towards government intervention due to the nature of the WPA itself, but this document only concerns the seal.",
