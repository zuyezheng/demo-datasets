    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the awarding of the Purple Heart medal to members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. It outlines the criteria for the award, including posthumous awards and the process for awarding it to the next of kin. It also addresses the awarding of subsequent recognitions for further qualifying events. There is nothing explicitly ideological about this document. It does not touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
