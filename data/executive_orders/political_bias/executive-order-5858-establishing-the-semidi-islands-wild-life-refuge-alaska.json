    "critique": "This document establishes a wildlife refuge. It is signed by the president, so it is an executive order. It restricts land use to protect wildlife. It does not seem to have any bearing on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It is difficult to place on the left-right spectrum, but arguably conservation is a liberal value.",
