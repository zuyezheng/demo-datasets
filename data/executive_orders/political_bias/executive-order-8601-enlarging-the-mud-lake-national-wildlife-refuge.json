    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1940 that adds land to the Mud Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Minnesota. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The action of setting aside land for a wildlife refuge could be seen as a slight intervention, but it's minimal.",
