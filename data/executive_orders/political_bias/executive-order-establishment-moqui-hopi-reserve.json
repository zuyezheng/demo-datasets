    "critique": "The document establishes a reservation for the Moqui tribe and other Indians, withdrawing the land from settlement and sale. This suggests a balanced approach to federalism, as it involves federal action to protect indigenous land rights. There's a slight lean towards social inclusion by prioritizing the occupancy of the Moqui and other Indians. Economic regulation is not directly addressed, but the withdrawal from settlement and sale implies some level of government intervention in land use. Executive power is expanded as the order is issued by the executive mansion.",
