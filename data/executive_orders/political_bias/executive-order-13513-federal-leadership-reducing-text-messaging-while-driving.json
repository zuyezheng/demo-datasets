    "critique": "The document is an executive order prohibiting federal employees and encouraging federal contractors from texting while driving. This seems like a fairly moderate and common-sense policy. It doesn't strongly align with either liberal or conservative ideologies. It has a slight impact on executive power, as it directs agencies to take action, but it also includes exemptions. It doesn't significantly impact federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
