    "critique": "This document pertains to increasing the personnel and facilities of the Coast Guard in response to a national emergency related to neutrality. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It expands executive power to some extent by authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to increase facilities and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget to waive appropriations. It also touches on national security by strengthening the Coast Guard.",
