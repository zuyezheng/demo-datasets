    "critique": "This document pertains to the designation of Coast Guard vessels for patrolling waters frequented by seal herds and sea otters for the enforcement of a 1912 act. Given the subject matter, the document has minimal ideological content. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document itself doesn't expand executive power, it just executes existing law.",
