It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The establishment of a commission could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's primarily for advisory purposes.",
