    "critique": "This is a simple executive order that allows one person to continue in their role despite having reached the retirement age. There is nothing in the document to suggest a particular ideological tilt. It does not deal with immigration. It uses executive power to allow an exception to a rule, but it is a very specific and limited use of that power. It does not relate to federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
