    "critique": "This executive order primarily extends the operation of existing advisory committees. It touches on a wide range of areas, from national security to the arts and humanities. There's a slight tilt towards social inclusion and diversity through the amendments to Executive Orders related to Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, and Black Americans. However, the main thrust is administrative and doesn't drastically alter existing policies or power structures. Therefore, most scores should be close to neutral.",
