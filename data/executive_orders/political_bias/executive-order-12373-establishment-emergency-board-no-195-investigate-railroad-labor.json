    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between a transportation union and certain railroads. It is based on the Railway Labor Act. There is nothing to suggest a liberal or conservative bias. There is nothing about immigration. It does not expand executive power, but rather uses existing power. It does not relate to federalism. It does not relate to national security or civil liberties. It involves government intervention in the economy by establishing a board to investigate a labor dispute. It does not relate to social inclusion.",
