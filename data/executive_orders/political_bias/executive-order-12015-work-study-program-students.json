    "critique": "This executive order pertains to career-related work-study programs and the conversion of student appointments to career or career-conditional appointments within the Federal government. It outlines the conditions under which a student's appointment can be converted, emphasizing completion of educational programs, agency recommendation, and satisfaction of Civil Service Commission requirements. The order also tasks the Civil Service Commission with prescribing regulations for program implementation and evaluation. There is nothing particularly liberal or conservative about this, so it should be close to zero on the ideological tilt. It does not deal with immigration. It does not expand executive power in any meaningful way. It does not obviously shift power between the state and federal governments. It does not deal with national security or civil liberties. It has a very slight interventionist bent, but is mostly neutral. It does not deal with social inclusion.",
