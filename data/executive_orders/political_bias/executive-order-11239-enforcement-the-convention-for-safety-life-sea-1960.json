    "critique": "This document is an executive order implementing the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea. It directs various government agencies to fulfill their obligations under the convention. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It does not directly address immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power insofar as it directs agencies to act, but this is a routine implementation of a treaty. It does not obviously shift power between the federal and state governments. It focuses on safety, which could be seen as related to national security, but it also protects individuals. It involves economic regulation insofar as it mandates safety standards for ships. It does not directly address social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
