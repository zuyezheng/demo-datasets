    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1913 that reserves land for Navajo Indians. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It is slightly in favor of social inclusion, as it is reserving land for a specific group of people. It does not seem to have a strong impact on executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation. It does not seem to have a strong impact on immigration.",
