    "critique": "This document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public water reserve no. 12. It transfers control of land. There is not enough information to determine its ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications (beyond the act of revocation itself), national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The federalism aspect is slightly negative as it returns control to the state.",
