    "critique": "This executive order designates the Displaced Persons Commission as the agency responsible for investigating and reporting on displaced persons seeking admission to the United States under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948. It also directs other government agencies to assist the Commission in its duties. The order itself doesn't express a strong ideological tilt, but the underlying Act addresses immigration, so it has some relevance. The order itself seems neutral on executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. However, the act it references does deal with immigration.",
