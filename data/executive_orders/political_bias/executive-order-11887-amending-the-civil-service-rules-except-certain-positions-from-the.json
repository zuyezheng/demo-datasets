    "critique": "This document is a very minor amendment to a civil service rule, adding the Department of Commerce to a list. It's difficult to assign strong political biases to such a specific and seemingly administrative change. It doesn't obviously relate to ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be near zero.",
