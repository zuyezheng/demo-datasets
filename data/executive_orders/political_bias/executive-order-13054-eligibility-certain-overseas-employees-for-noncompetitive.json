    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the hiring of family members of federal employees who worked for the American Institute in Taiwan. It allows them to be appointed non-competitively to positions in the executive branch. This seems to be a fairly technical and specific issue, and it's difficult to map it onto the standard political axes. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion or restriction of executive power, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most scores will be neutral. There might be a slight lean towards expanding executive power, as it's an executive order, but it's a very minor one.",
