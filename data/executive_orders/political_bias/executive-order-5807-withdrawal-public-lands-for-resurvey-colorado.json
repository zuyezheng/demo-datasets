    "critique": "This document is a withdrawal of public lands in Colorado from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation, pending a resurvey. It cites the act of June 25, 1910, as amended by the act of August 24, 1912, and mentions a resurvey under the act of March 3, 1909. There is nothing to suggest a liberal or conservative ideological tilt. The document does not address immigration. It does not expand executive power, as it is subject to existing laws and can be revoked by the President or Congress. It could be seen as slightly favoring federal control, as it withdraws lands from use pending a federal resurvey. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It could be seen as slightly interventionist in the sense that it withdraws land from economic activity. It does not address social inclusion.",
