    "critique": "This document is an executive order from President Lincoln regarding the retirement of General Winfield Scott and the appointment of General George B. McClellan. It expresses gratitude for Scott's service and announces McClellan as his replacement. There is nothing explicitly ideological in the traditional left-right sense. The document does not address immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does not substantially expand executive power, as it is a routine military personnel matter. It does not directly address federalism or the balance between national security and civil liberties. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
