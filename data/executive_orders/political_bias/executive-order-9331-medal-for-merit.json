    "critique": "This document establishes the rules and regulations for awarding the Medal for Merit to civilians of nations allied with the United States during World War II. It outlines the criteria for the award, the establishment of a review board, and the process for making recommendations to the President. There is nothing explicitly ideological about this. It seems to be centrist. There is nothing about immigration. It expands executive power a little bit because it is an executive order. It does not seem to relate to federalism. It does not seem to relate to national security vs. civil liberties. It does not seem to relate to economic regulation. It does not seem to relate to social inclusion.",
