    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous one regarding the President's Advisory Council on the Arts. It primarily deals with the composition of the council, specifying the members and their terms. There's no direct impact on immigration, national security, or economic regulation. The order doesn't explicitly expand executive power, but it does allow the President to appoint members, which is a standard executive function. It doesn't seem to have a strong ideological tilt, federalism implications, or a direct impact on social inclusion, though promoting the arts could be seen as a slight positive for diversity and cultural expression. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
