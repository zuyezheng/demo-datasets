    "critique": "This executive order changes the name of a committee and expands its membership. It seems to promote social inclusion by using more respectful language and involving more departments. There's no indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power changes, federalism implications, national security concerns, or economic regulation. Therefore, most axes should be neutral, with a slight positive score for social inclusion.",
