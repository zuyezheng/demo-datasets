It outlines different classes (A, B, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) corresponding to salary ranges. It also excludes certain presidential appointees, laborers, workmen, and watchmen from this classification. The document further integrates the United States Civil Service Commission into the classified departmental service, subjecting it to existing civil service rules.",
