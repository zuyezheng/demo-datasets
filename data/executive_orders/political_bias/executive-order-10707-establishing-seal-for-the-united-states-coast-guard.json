    "critique": "This document is an executive order approving the official seal for the United States Coast Guard. It primarily deals with the aesthetic and symbolic representation of the Coast Guard. There is no direct impact on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores should be neutral across all axes.",
