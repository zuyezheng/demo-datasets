It aims to standardize military-preference benefits for former classified employees seeking reinstatement. The document itself doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a substantial way. The change seems technical and procedural.",
