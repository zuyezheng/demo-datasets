    "critique": "This document is an executive order that extends the life of a commission to assist states in the fight against drunk driving. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It does not relate to immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by extending the life of the commission, but it is a very minor expansion. It relates to federalism by assisting states, but it does not strongly shift the balance of power. It does not relate to national security vs. civil liberties. It does not relate to economic regulation. It promotes social inclusion by fighting drunk driving, which can disproportionately affect marginalized communities.",
