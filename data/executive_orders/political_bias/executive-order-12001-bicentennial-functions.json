    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the transfer of bicentennial functions to the Secretary of the Interior. It seems largely administrative, with little direct impact on ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The transfer of functions could be seen as a slight shift in federal control, but it's minimal.",
