    "critique": "This document is an amendment to a previous executive order regarding the President's Committee for Traffic Safety. It primarily concerns the composition of the committee, specifying the number of members and the sectors from which they should be appointed. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, as traffic safety is generally a non-partisan issue. The document does not address immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The change in committee composition could be seen as a very slight expansion of executive power, but it's minimal. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
