It primarily concerns the composition of the committee, expanding the range of individuals and organizations represented. There is no direct discussion of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial and revised scores will remain neutral across all axes.",
