It cites the act of June 25, 1910, as amended by the act of August 24, 1912, and the act of March 3, 1909. There is nothing to suggest any ideological tilt. There is nothing about immigration. There is nothing about executive power. There is nothing about federalism. There is nothing about national security vs. civil liberties. There is nothing about economic regulation. There is nothing about social inclusion.",
