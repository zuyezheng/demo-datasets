    "critique": "This document revokes a previous executive order related to the control of the Panama Canal and the Canal Zone. It's a simple revocation, so it doesn't strongly lean in any particular ideological direction. The action itself doesn't directly impact immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The revocation might slightly reduce executive power compared to the previous order, but it's not a significant shift.",
