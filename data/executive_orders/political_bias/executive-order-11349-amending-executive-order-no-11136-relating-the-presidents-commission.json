    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's Committee on Consumer Interests and the Consumer Advisory Council. It aims to protect consumer rights and ensure a fair marketplace. The order emphasizes cooperation between business, industry, and consumers. It does not directly address immigration, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. It leans towards government intervention in the economy to protect consumers. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the focus on consumer protection and government oversight. The expansion of executive power is moderate, as it creates committees and councils but does not grant new unilateral powers.",
