    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate disputes between Metro North Commuter Railroad and certain of its employees. It is a fairly neutral document that follows the Railway Labor Act. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It seems to have a slight impact on economic regulation and executive power, but not significantly. It doesn't seem to have any impact on federalism or social inclusion.",
