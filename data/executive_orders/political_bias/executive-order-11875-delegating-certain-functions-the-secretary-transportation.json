    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding a study on the expansion of war risk insurance. It designates the Secretary of Transportation to conduct the study and prepare a report. There is little to suggest any strong ideological tilt. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on economic regulation as it relates to war risk insurance.",
