    "critique": "This executive order cancels a previous order that set aside land in Arizona as a reservation for Apache Indians, restoring the land to the public domain. This action could be interpreted in several ways depending on one's perspective. Some might see it as detrimental to Native American interests, potentially opening up the land for exploitation by settlers or businesses. Others might view it as correcting a previous injustice or as promoting economic development. Given the historical context of the late 19th century, when the US government's policies toward Native Americans were often exploitative and disregarded their rights, canceling a reservation and returning the land to the public domain likely reflects a bias against Native American interests and a prioritization of westward expansion and resource extraction. Therefore, the initial scores lean conservative, favor state control, and do not prioritize social inclusion.",
