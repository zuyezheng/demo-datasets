    "critique": "This document re-establishes the Office of Economic Stabilization and the Economic Stabilization Board, granting the government significant control over the economy. This suggests a strong interventionist approach. The order does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Therefore, these aspects are considered neutral. The ideological tilt leans towards liberal due to the interventionist economic policies.",
