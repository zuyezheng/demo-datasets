    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1937 that withdraws certain lands in Washington for use and development by the Department of Agriculture for reforestation, forestation, soil erosion control and other land utilization activities. It also allows for prospecting, locating, developing, mining, entering, leasing, or patenting the mineral resources of the lands under the applicable laws. There is nothing in the document that suggests a particular ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion of executive power, federalism stance, national security vs. civil liberties concern, or social inclusion issue. The only axis that is relevant is economic regulation, where the document leans towards government intervention by reserving land for specific uses.",
