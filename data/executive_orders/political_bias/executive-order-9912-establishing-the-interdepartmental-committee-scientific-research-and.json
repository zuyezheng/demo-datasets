    "critique": "The document establishes an Interdepartmental Committee on Scientific Research and Development to coordinate federal research efforts. It aims to improve efficiency and collaboration among agencies, study administrative policies, and advise on federal support for research. The order emphasizes internal management and doesn't directly address social issues, immigration, or civil liberties. Therefore, most scores are neutral, with a slight lean towards federal control due to the committee's coordinating role.",
