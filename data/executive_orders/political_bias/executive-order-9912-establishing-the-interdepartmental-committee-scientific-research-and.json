    "critique": "This executive order establishes an Interdepartmental Committee on Scientific Research and Development. It aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of federal research and development programs. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by creating a committee and tasking it with duties prescribed by the President, but it also encourages collaboration among federal agencies. It centralizes federal control over scientific research, so it leans towards federal primacy. There's a slight intervention in the economy through coordinated research and development. It doesn't directly address social inclusion.",
