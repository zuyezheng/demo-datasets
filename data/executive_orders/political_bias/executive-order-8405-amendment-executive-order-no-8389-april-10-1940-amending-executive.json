    "critique": "This executive order, issued during World War II, freezes assets of countries invaded by Nazi Germany. It's difficult to assess its placement on the traditional left-right spectrum. It expands executive power and federal control significantly as a wartime measure. It prioritizes national security over individual liberties due to the emergency situation. Economic regulation is heavy, as the government intervenes in financial transactions. There is no clear impact on social inclusion. Given the context, the revised scores reflect the emergency powers claimed during wartime.",
