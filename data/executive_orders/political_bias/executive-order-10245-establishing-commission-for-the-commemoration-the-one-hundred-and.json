    "critique": "This document is an executive order establishing a commission to commemorate the 175th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. It invokes themes of freedom, resistance to tyranny, and faith in Divine Providence. It seems fairly centrist and balanced, with no strong lean in any particular direction. The commission is composed of members from different branches of government, suggesting a balanced approach. There's no direct impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
