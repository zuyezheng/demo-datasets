    "critique": "The document pertains to the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 and an executive order from 1934, directing the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works to allot $50,000 to the National Recovery Review Board. This act was part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program, which aimed to combat the Great Depression through government intervention in the economy. Given this context, the document likely reflects a liberal approach to economic regulation. The document does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, these axes should be scored as neutral. The document itself does not expand executive power, it simply executes previously established policy.",
