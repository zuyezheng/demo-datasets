It adjusts the conditions under which they are entitled to this pay. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
