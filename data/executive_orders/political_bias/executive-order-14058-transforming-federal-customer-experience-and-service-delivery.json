    "critique": "This executive order focuses on improving government services and customer experience. It aims to make government processes more efficient, accessible, and equitable. It emphasizes human-centered design, empirical research, and the use of technology to modernize government services. There is a strong emphasis on reducing administrative burdens and 'time taxes' on the public. The order also promotes equity and inclusion, directing agencies to address systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits for underserved communities. It does not directly address immigration, national security, or economic regulation in a way that would warrant a strong bias score. It could be argued that streamlining processes and reducing burdens could be seen as a form of deregulation, but it's not the primary focus. The order seems to expand federal power by centralizing service delivery and requiring agencies to coordinate their efforts. It also touches on social inclusion by aiming to improve services for underserved communities. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
