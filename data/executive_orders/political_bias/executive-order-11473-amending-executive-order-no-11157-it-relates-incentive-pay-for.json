    "critique": "This document pertains to a very specific aspect of military compensation, namely, duty involving frequent and regular participation in flight operations on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier. It clarifies the definition of such duty for the purpose of determining eligibility for certain pay. There is no obvious ideological tilt, immigration component, expansion or restriction of executive power, federalism implication, or bearing on national security vs. civil liberties. It has no impact on economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
