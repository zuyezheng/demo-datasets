    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1984 that aims to encourage and facilitate the development of commercial expendable launch vehicle (ELV) operations by private United States enterprises. It designates the Department of Transportation as the lead agency for this effort and outlines responsibilities for the Secretary of Transportation and other agencies. The order seeks to streamline the licensing process and remove regulatory obstacles to ELV commercialization. It does not touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It promotes deregulation and private enterprise in the space industry. It does not appear to expand executive power significantly, but rather coordinates existing agencies. It also does not seem to strongly favor either federal or state control, but rather focuses on interagency coordination. It has a slight conservative tilt due to its emphasis on deregulation and promotion of private enterprise.",
