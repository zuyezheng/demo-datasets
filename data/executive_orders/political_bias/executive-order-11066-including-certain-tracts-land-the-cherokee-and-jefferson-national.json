    "critique": "This document is a land transfer agreement between the Tennessee Valley Authority and the United States Department of Agriculture. It transfers land to be included in the Cherokee and Jefferson National Forests. There is no immediately obvious ideological tilt. It does not deal with immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It may be seen as slightly favoring federalism as it consolidates land under federal control, but this is a very minor effect.",
