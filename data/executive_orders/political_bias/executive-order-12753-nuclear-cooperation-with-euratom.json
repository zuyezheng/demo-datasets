    "critique": "The document focuses on extending peaceful nuclear cooperation with the European Atomic Energy Community, emphasizing non-proliferation objectives and national security. There is no direct discussion of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial and revised scores reflect a neutral stance on these issues, with a slight emphasis on security due to the nature of the document.",
