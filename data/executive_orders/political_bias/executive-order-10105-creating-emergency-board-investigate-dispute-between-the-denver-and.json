    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between a railroad company and its employees. It seems to be a fairly neutral action, intervening in a labor dispute to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. It doesn't strongly lean in any particular ideological direction, nor does it obviously affect immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The creation of a board could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's primarily an act of mediation.",
