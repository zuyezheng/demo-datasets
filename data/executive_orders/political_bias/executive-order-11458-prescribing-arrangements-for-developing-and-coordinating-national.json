    "critique": "This executive order aims to promote minority business enterprises through coordination, information dissemination, and advisory councils. It directs the Secretary of Commerce to lead these efforts and enlists the cooperation of other federal departments and agencies. There is an emphasis on diversity and inclusion through the focus on minority businesses. There is moderate government intervention in the economy through the promotion and support of minority businesses. The order seems to expand federal power by tasking the Secretary of Commerce with coordinating efforts across different federal departments and agencies. There is no clear impact on immigration, national security, or civil liberties. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the focus on promoting minority businesses.",
