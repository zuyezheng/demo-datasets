    "critique": "This executive order, issued by George H.W. Bush in 1990, declares a national emergency and imposes economic sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait. It blocks Iraqi assets in the US, prohibits trade and financial transactions with Iraq, and restricts travel to Iraq. The order invokes the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act. It prioritizes national security and foreign policy interests. There is little direct impact on immigration or social inclusion. The order expands executive power to impose sanctions and control economic activity related to Iraq. It centralizes control at the federal level, specifically with the Secretary of the Treasury. The order reflects a national security focus and interventionist foreign policy. It does not directly address domestic ideological issues.",
