    "critique": "This executive order pertains to budgetary submissions for various federal agencies. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The order slightly centralizes budgetary control, giving a small positive score to Federalism.",
