    "critique": "This document pertains to incentive pay for submarine duty within the Navy. It amends a previous executive order to clarify and implement these pay incentives. Given the subject matter, the document has very little bearing on ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis with a slight relevance is executive power, as it is an executive order. However, it doesn't drastically expand or restrict executive authority; it mainly implements existing legislation. Therefore, a neutral score is appropriate for most axes.",
