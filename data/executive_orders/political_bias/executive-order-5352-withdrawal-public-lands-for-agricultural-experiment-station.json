    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1930 that reserves public lands in Alaska for the Bureau of Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture, in connection with its reindeer experiment station. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order simply sets aside land for a specific purpose. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The federal government is exerting control over land, so federalism is slightly positive.",
