    "critique": "This document describes the temporary withdrawal of land from settlement for customs and immigration inspection purposes. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It is related to immigration, so it has some relevance there. It is an executive order, but it does not necessarily expand executive power. It is related to federal land, so it may have some impact on federalism. It does not seem to directly address national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
