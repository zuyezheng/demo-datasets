    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Federal Legal Council and outlines its functions, including promoting coordination among federal legal offices, improving management of federal lawyers, and resolving interagency legal disputes. It also establishes a litigation notice system and encourages agencies to make legal opinions available to the public. There is nothing explicitly ideological about this order. It seems to be focused on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the federal legal system.",
