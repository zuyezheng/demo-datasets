    "critique": "This document is an executive order allocating funds to control the Japanese beetle infestation in St. Louis, Missouri. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt as it focuses on a specific agricultural issue. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral.",
