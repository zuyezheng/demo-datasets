    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating authorities and functions related to the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015. It primarily concerns international trade and poverty reduction. There's no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It delegates presidential authority to the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies, which doesn't inherently expand executive power but rather distributes it. It doesn't explicitly address federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that allows for a clear scoring. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral (0).",
