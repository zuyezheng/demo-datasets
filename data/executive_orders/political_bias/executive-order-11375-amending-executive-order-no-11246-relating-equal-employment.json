    "critique": "This executive order expands on previous orders to include sex as a protected class, furthering equal opportunity in federal employment and contracting. It aligns with liberal values of social inclusion and equality. It does expand executive power slightly by amending a previous order. There is no impact on immigration, federalism, or national security. It promotes economic intervention by mandating non-discrimination policies for federal contractors.",
