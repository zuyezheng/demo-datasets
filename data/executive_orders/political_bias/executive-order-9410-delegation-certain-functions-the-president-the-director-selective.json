    "critique": "This executive order reorganizes the Selective Service System during World War II, transferring authority and clarifying responsibilities between the Director of Selective Service and the War Manpower Commission. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or social inclusion. It delegates presidential powers to the Director of Selective Service, potentially expanding executive power, but this is within the context of wartime mobilization. It also appears to centralize control at the federal level, and prioritizes national security during wartime. There is no direct economic regulation mentioned.",
