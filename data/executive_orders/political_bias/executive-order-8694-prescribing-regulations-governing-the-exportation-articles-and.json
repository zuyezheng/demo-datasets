    "critique": "The document focuses on export regulations related to national defense, indicating a priority on security and government control over trade. There is no direct discussion of social issues, immigration, or civil liberties, making those axes neutral. The emphasis on executive orders suggests an expansion of executive power during a time of national emergency.",
