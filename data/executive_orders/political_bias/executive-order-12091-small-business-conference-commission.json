    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the establishment and modification of the Small Business Conference Commission. It aims to facilitate a White House Conference on Small Business in 1980. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Its primary focus is on economic regulation by providing a platform for small businesses to voice their concerns and influence policy. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight lean towards intervention on the economic regulation axis.",
