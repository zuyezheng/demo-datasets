    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the US occupation of Austria following WWII. It outlines the responsibilities of the Department of State and the role of the US High Commissioner in Austria. It also addresses the relationship between the High Commissioner, the Commanding General of US Forces in Austria, and the Economic Cooperation Administration. There is no direct impact on immigration, civil liberties within the US, or economic regulation within the US. The order primarily concerns foreign policy and the administration of occupied territory. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order does delegate authority to the Department of State and clarifies the chain of command, which could be seen as a slight shift towards federal control and potentially a slight expansion of executive power in the context of foreign affairs.",
