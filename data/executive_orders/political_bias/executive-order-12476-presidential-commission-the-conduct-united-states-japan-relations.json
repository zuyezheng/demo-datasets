    "critique": "This document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, changing the name of an advisory group and making minor adjustments to its operational details. It does not touch upon any of the major political axes like immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The ideological tilt is also neutral as the document doesn't promote any specific political ideology.",
