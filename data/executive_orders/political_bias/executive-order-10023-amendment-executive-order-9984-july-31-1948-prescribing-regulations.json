    "critique": "This executive order pertains to a very specific and relatively minor issue: providing a clothing allowance to members of the United States Navy Band. It doesn't touch on broad ideological themes, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security, or large-scale economic regulation. Its primary effect is to allocate funds for a specific purpose within the military. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The social inclusion axis is also neutral as it doesn't promote or hinder diversity; it simply addresses a specific group within the military.",
