    "critique": "The document establishes an advisory council on science, technology, and innovation. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The council is meant to advise the President on science and technology policy, which could indirectly influence these areas, but the order itself is neutral. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
