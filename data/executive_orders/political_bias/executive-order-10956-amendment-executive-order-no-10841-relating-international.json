    "critique": "This document amends a previous executive order related to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, specifically concerning international cooperation. It stipulates that determinations made under paragraph (2) of section 2(a) of Executive Order No. 10841 must be referred to the President and become effective 15 days after referral unless disapproved. This change appears to centralize more authority in the President's hands regarding international cooperation related to atomic energy. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, impact on federalism, or implications for national security vs. civil liberties. The economic regulation and social inclusion axes are also not directly impacted by this amendment.",
