    "critique": "The document introduces a passport requirement for entry into the United States, primarily targeting individuals from neighboring British Provinces. This suggests a move towards stricter border control and regulation of immigration. The document does not explicitly address economic regulation, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, these aspects are scored as neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly conservative due to the restrictive immigration policy.",
