    "critique": "This executive order extends the operation of several advisory committees. Most of these committees seem fairly non-ideological. The order itself does not seem to expand executive power, but rather delegates some presidential functions to agency heads. It does not seem to touch on immigration, national security, or economic regulation. It has a slight positive impact on social inclusion by continuing the board on historically black colleges and universities and the committee for people with intellectual disabilities. It does not seem to have any impact on federalism.",
