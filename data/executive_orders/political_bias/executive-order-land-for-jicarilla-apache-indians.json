    "critique": "The document establishes a reservation for the Jicarilla Apache Indians, which can be seen as promoting social inclusion for this specific group. However, it also includes a provision protecting the rights of existing settlers, which could be interpreted as a compromise between the interests of the Native American population and the existing settlers. The order does not explicitly address broader issues of immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or economic regulation. Therefore, most of the scores are neutral, with a slight positive score for social inclusion to reflect the establishment of the reservation.",
