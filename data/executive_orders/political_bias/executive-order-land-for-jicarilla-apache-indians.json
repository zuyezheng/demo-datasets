    "critique": "This executive order establishes a reservation for the Jicarilla Apache Indians in New Mexico. \n\n*   **Ideological Tilt:** (0) The order itself doesn't lean strongly left or right. It's a specific action related to land use and indigenous populations, which doesn't directly align with typical left-right political debates.\n*   **Immigration Approach:** (0) This order has no bearing on immigration policies.\n*   **Executive Power:** (0) While it's an executive order, it doesn't drastically expand or restrict executive power. It's a specific land designation.\n*   **Federalism:** (+1) Setting aside federal land for a reservation implies a degree of federal control over land management, thus a slight lean towards federal primacy.\n*   **National Security vs. Civil Liberties:** (0) The order doesn't directly address national security or civil liberties.\n*   **Economic Regulation:** (0) This order doesn't directly regulate the economy.\n*   **Social Inclusion:** (+2) Creating a reservation for the Jicarilla Apache Indians promotes their cultural preservation and provides them with a designated space, indicating a move towards social inclusion.\n\nRevised Scores:\n*   Ideological Tilt: 0\n*   Immigration Approach: 0\n*   Executive Power: 0\n*   Federalism: +1\n*   National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0\n*   Economic Regulation: 0\n*   Social Inclusion: +2",
