    "critique": "This document revokes Executive Order 9074, which directed the Secretary of the Navy to protect vessels, harbors, ports, and waterfront facilities. Since this order was issued during World War II, revoking it in 1945 suggests a shift away from wartime security measures. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The primary focus seems to be on national security, and revoking the order suggests a slight move towards prioritizing civil liberties or a return to a peacetime balance. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight lean towards liberties/privacy.",
