    "critique": "This document is an executive order that abolishes two customs ports of entry in North Carolina. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores are neutral. The federalism aspect is slightly tilted towards federal control as it is a federal decision impacting state ports, but the impact is minimal.",
