    "critique": "This document extends the life of several advisory committees. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It does not deal with immigration. It does not expand executive power, but rather delegates some functions to agency heads. It does not obviously favor state or federal control. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It does not directly regulate the economy. It touches on social inclusion through the Committee on Small and Minority Business Ownership and the President's Committee on Mental Retardation, but not in a way that strongly emphasizes diversity or conformity.",
