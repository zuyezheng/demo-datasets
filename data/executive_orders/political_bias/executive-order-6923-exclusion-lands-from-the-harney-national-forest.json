    "critique": "This document is a proclamation regarding land use and forest boundaries in South Dakota. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It appears to be an administrative action related to land management. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism axis is slightly tilted towards state control as it adjusts the boundaries of a national forest, potentially giving more control to the state over the excluded land.",
