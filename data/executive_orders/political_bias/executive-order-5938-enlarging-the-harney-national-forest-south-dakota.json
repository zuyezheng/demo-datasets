    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1932 adding land to the Harney National Forest in South Dakota. It references the authority of Congress and the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture. The order also protects existing legal appropriations of the land. Given the context and content, the document has a moderate impact on most of the axes. It has a slight impact on federalism, as it involves the federal government managing land. It has a slight impact on economic regulation, as it involves land use. It has no discernible impact on immigration, executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, ideological tilt, or social inclusion.",
