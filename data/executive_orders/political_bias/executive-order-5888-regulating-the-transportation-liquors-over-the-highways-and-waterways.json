    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the transportation of liquor through the Canal Zone, focusing on regulatory aspects rather than broad ideological or social issues. It addresses a specific legal amendment related to the National Prohibition Act and establishes procedures for liquor transit. The order doesn't directly relate to immigration, civil liberties, or economic regulation in a significant way. The primary focus is on ensuring compliance with existing laws during transit. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism aspect is slightly relevant as it concerns the relationship between the federal government and the Canal Zone, but it's not a major shift in power dynamics.",
