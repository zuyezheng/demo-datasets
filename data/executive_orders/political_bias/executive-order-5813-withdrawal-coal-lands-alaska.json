    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order, reserving land for investigation, examination, and classification. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The order does grant the executive branch the power to withdraw lands, but this is a fairly standard administrative function, so it doesn't represent a significant expansion of executive power.",
