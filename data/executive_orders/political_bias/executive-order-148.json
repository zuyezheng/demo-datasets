    "critique": "This document establishes an agricultural experiment station in Alaska. It seems to have minimal political implications. The establishment of an agricultural experiment station doesn't strongly align with any particular ideology. It's a fairly neutral act in terms of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
