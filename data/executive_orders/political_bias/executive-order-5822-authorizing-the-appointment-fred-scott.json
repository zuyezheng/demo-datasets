    "critique": "This document is an exception to civil service rules for a specific individual. It doesn't seem to have a strong ideological leaning. It is a specific case, so immigration, security/liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion are not relevant. It does expand executive power slightly by bypassing civil service rules, and it leans towards federal control as it involves a federal penitentiary.",
