    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts an employee from compulsory retirement. It does not seem to have strong implications for any of the axes. It is a rather mundane action. Therefore, most of the axes should be scored as neutral. The only possible exception might be executive power, but even here, it is a fairly limited and specific action, so I will score it as neutral as well.",
