    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous order to add members to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The added members are the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy. This change seems to broaden the scope of CFIUS by including more perspectives, but it doesn't inherently lean strongly in any particular ideological direction. It could be argued that including the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy suggests a slight increase in government intervention in the economy, but it's not a major shift. The order itself doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral.",
