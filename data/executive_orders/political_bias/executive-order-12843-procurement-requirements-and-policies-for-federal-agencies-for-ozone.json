    "critique": "This executive order focuses on environmental protection by phasing out ozone-depleting substances. It encourages the use of alternative substances and technologies, potentially benefiting U.S. manufacturers. The order directs federal agencies to minimize the procurement of ozone-depleting substances and give preference to safer alternatives. It also requires reporting and compliance with the Clean Air Act Amendments and the Montreal Protocol. There is little to no impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The order promotes government intervention in the economy to encourage environmentally friendly practices. Therefore, the ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the environmental focus.",
