    "critique": "This executive order aims to prevent uneconomic uses and development of the nation's flood plains. It directs executive agencies to evaluate flood hazards when planning the location of new facilities and to minimize the exposure of facilities to potential flood damage. It also encourages land use appropriate to the degree of hazard involved. This suggests a moderate level of government intervention in economic regulation to prevent flood losses. The order doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes should be neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal, as it promotes government intervention for environmental protection and disaster prevention.",
