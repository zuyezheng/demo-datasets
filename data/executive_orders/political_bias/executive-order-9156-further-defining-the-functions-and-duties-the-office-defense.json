    "critique": "This executive order, issued during World War II, expands the authority of the Office of Defense Transportation to regulate rubber-borne transportation. It aims to conserve resources and prioritize essential activities. Ideologically, it reflects a moderate interventionist approach (+2) necessary during wartime. Immigration is not addressed (0). Executive power is expanded to meet wartime needs (+3). Federalism is strengthened as the federal government takes control of transportation (+3). National security is prioritized over individual liberties (+3), as restrictions are placed on civilian transportation. Economic regulation is increased (+4) to manage resources. Social inclusion is not directly addressed (0). Revised scores reflect these considerations.",
