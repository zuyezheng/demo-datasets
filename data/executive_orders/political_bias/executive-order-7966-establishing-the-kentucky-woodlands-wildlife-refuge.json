    "critique": "This document establishes a wildlife refuge in Kentucky. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on federalism by reserving land for federal use. It also touches on economic regulation by restricting hunting and trapping, and on national security vs. civil liberties by restricting access to the refuge.",
