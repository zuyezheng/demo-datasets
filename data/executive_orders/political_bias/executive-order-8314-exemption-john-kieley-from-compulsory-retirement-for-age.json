    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts John Kieley, Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury, from compulsory retirement for age for a period of one year. It is a very specific and narrow action. It does not seem to have any significant ideological tilt, immigration implications, or impact on federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it touches upon is executive power, as it is an exercise of the President's authority to make exceptions to retirement rules. However, it is a fairly minor and routine exercise of that power.",
