    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts Dr. Howard K. Tuttle from compulsory retirement for age for one year. It is a very specific and narrow action. It does not seem to have any broad political implications. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The only possible exception might be executive power, which could be seen as a slight expansion, but given the narrow scope, I will keep it neutral.",
