It aims to enhance social justice and economic well-being, involve private institutions, and define the role of the public sector. The commission is designed to be non-partisan, with members appointed by the President and a focus on citizen participation. The document does not explicitly address immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that allows for a clear assessment of bias.",
