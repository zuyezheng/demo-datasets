    "critique": "This executive order withdraws public lands for a migratory bird refuge. This seems environmentally focused, which is generally considered liberal. There's no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. The ideological tilt leans slightly liberal due to the environmental focus.",
