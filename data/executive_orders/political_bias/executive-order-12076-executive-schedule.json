    "critique": "This executive order primarily deals with the placement of various positions within the Executive Schedule, specifically levels IV and V. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It could be argued that by organizing the government, it has a slight impact on executive power and federalism, but these are minimal. There's no direct impact on economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with slight adjustments for executive power and federalism.",
