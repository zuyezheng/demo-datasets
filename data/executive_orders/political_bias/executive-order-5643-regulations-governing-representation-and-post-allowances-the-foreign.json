    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1931 detailing regulations for representation and post allowances for diplomatic, consular, and Foreign Service officers. It outlines the purposes, scope, apportionment, and accounting procedures for these allowances. There is nothing explicitly ideological in this document. It seems to be purely administrative. Therefore, the ideological tilt is neutral. There is nothing about immigration in this document. There is nothing about executive power in this document. There is nothing about federalism in this document. There is nothing about national security vs. civil liberties in this document. There is nothing about economic regulation in this document. There is nothing about social inclusion in this document.",
