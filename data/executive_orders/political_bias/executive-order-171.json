    "critique": "This document concerns a specific appropriation for a survey of Guimaras Island to establish naval facilities. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt as it is a practical matter. There's no direct impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
