    "critique": "This executive order concerns the civil service and the status of temporary employees. It revokes a previous executive order related to an 'Emergency Replacement List' and provides a pathway for certain employees on that list to acquire classified civil service status. It also stipulates that appointments under this order be charged to the regular apportionment of appointments among states and territories. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion of executive power, or impact on national security vs. civil liberties. It seems to have a slight impact on federalism and economic regulation and social inclusion.",
