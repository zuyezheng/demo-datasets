    "critique": "The document pertains to the method of appointing compositors and pressmen, changing it from noncompetitive to competitive examination. This seems like a move towards meritocracy and away from potential patronage, but it's hard to map this directly onto the traditional left-right spectrum. There's no clear indication of immigration policy, executive power shift, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation changes, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The change from non-competitive to competitive examination could be seen as a slight move towards deregulation in the sense that it promotes a more open and competitive labor market, but the effect is minimal.",
