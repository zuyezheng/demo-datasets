    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1894 directing executive departments to include messengers, assistant messengers, and watchmen under civil service classifications. This seems to expand the scope of civil service protections to more workers. Ideologically, this could be seen as a slight move towards greater government involvement in employment, but it's very mild. There's no clear stance on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The economic regulation aspect is minimal, as it just extends civil service classifications. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
