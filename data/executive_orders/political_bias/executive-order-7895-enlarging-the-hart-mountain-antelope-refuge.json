    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the expansion of the Hart Mountain Antelope Refuge in Oregon by including private lands acquired or leased by the United States. It does not directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order itself doesn't inherently expand executive power beyond managing federal lands.",
