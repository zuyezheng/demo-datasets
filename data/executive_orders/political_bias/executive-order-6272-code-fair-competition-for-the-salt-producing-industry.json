    "critique": "This document is an approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Salt Producing Industry, issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 under the National Industrial Recovery Act. This act was a key component of the New Deal, aimed at addressing the economic crisis of the Great Depression. The document reflects a strong interventionist approach to economic regulation, as it establishes a code of fair competition and creates a committee to oversee the industry. This suggests a belief in government's role in stabilizing and guiding the economy. The document doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a restraining or expanding way, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Therefore, those aspects should be scored as neutral. The ideological tilt leans liberal due to the interventionist economic policies.",
