    "critique": "This document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal for coal in New Mexico. It facilitates a land exchange under a specific act. Given the limited scope and focus on land management, the political bias is minimal. It's difficult to assign strong scores on most axes. The action could be seen as slightly deregulatory in that it enables land exchange, but it's primarily an administrative action.",
