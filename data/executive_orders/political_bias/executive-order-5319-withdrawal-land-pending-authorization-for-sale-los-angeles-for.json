    "critique": "This document is an executive order withdrawing land from settlement to protect Los Angeles' water supply. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt as it is primarily a practical measure. It has no bearing on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it expands executive power insofar as it withdraws land, but this is a fairly standard function. It favors federal control over land management. It could be seen as a form of economic intervention, but a very mild one. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
