    "critique": "This executive order focuses on ethics and impartiality within the Postal Rate Commission. It aims to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain public confidence. There's no clear indication of a liberal or conservative ideology. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order does delegate authority to the Civil Service Commission to establish ethical guidelines, which could be seen as a slight restraint on executive power, but it's primarily about ensuring ethical conduct within an existing framework.",
