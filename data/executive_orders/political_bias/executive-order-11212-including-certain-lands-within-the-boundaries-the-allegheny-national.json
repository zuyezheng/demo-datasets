    "critique": "This document modifies the boundaries of the Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania. It's a land management decision, so it doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on federalism, as it consolidates federal control over the specified lands. Therefore, most scores will be neutral, with a slight lean towards federal control.",
