    "critique": "This executive order establishes and continues the President's Commission on Executive Exchange. It facilitates the exchange of executives between the private sector and the government. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by continuing the commission and defining its responsibilities, but it's a relatively minor expansion. It doesn't significantly impact federalism. It doesn't directly address national security or civil liberties. It promotes some government intervention by creating a program for executive exchange. It doesn't strongly emphasize either conformity or diversity.",
