    "critique": "This executive order establishes military commissions to try alien unlawful enemy combatants. It relies on the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and the Authorization for Use of Military Force. The order defines \"unlawful enemy combatant\" and \"alien\" and supersedes parts of a previous military order from 2001. It also includes general provisions about implementation, cooperation from executive departments, and a disclaimer that it doesn't create any enforceable rights. Given the context of the War on Terror and the establishment of military commissions, several axes are affected.\n\nIdeological Tilt: The order reflects a conservative approach to national security, prioritizing the prosecution of suspected terrorists. Initial score: -3. Revised score: -3.\n\nImmigration Approach: The order specifically targets \"alien unlawful enemy combatants,\" indicating a restrictive approach to individuals who are not citizens and are deemed enemies. Initial score: -4. Revised score: -4.\n\nExecutive Power: The order establishes military commissions, expanding executive power in the realm of military justice. Initial score: 3. Revised score: 3.\n\nFederalism: The order doesn't directly address federalism, but the establishment of military commissions implies federal control over the prosecution of enemy combatants. Initial score: 1. Revised score: 1.\n\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The order prioritizes national security by establishing military commissions, potentially at the expense of civil liberties for those deemed unlawful enemy combatants. Initial score: 4. Revised score: 4.\n\nEconomic Regulation: The order has no direct impact on economic regulation. Initial score: 0. Revised score: 0.\n\nSocial Inclusion: The order does not promote social inclusion, as it specifically targets non-citizens deemed unlawful enemy combatants. Initial score: -2. Revised score: -2.",
