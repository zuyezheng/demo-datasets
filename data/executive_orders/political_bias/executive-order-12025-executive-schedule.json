    "critique": "This document is an executive order that changes a position within the Executive Schedule. It moves the 'Associate Attorney General, Department of Justice' to 'Adviser to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense for NATO Affairs, Department of Defense.' This seems to be a simple reshuffling of positions and does not directly impact any of the axes in a significant way. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
