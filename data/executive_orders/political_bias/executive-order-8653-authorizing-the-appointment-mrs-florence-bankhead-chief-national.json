    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1941 that waives civil service rules for a specific appointment. Given the historical context, it's difficult to assign a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in general, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that allows for a clear scoring. The order seems primarily administrative, with limited broader implications. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral.",
