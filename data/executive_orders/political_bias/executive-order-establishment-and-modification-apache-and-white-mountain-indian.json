    "critique": "This executive order from 1872 deals with the establishment and modification of Indian reservations. It's a historical document reflecting the policies of that era. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on a modern left-right spectrum, but given the context of the time, the creation of reservations, while seemingly beneficial, also facilitated the displacement and control of Native American populations. Immigration is not directly addressed. Executive power is expanded through the creation and modification of reservations. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government dictates reservation boundaries. National security is a consideration, as reservations were often used to control Native American populations. Economic regulation is not directly relevant. Social inclusion is negatively impacted as Native Americans are segregated onto reservations.",
