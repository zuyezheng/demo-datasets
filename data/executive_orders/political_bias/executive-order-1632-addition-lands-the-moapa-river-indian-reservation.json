    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1912 that adds land to the Moapa River Indian Reservation. \n\n*   Ideological Tilt: This is hard to place on a left-right spectrum. It could be seen as progressive in terms of indigenous rights, but also involves government control of land. I'll put it at +1.\n*   Immigration Approach: This is not relevant to immigration, so I'll put it at 0.\n*   Executive Power: This expands executive power by setting aside land, so I'll put it at +2.\n*   Federalism: This increases federal control over land, so I'll put it at +3.\n*   National Security vs. Civil Liberties: This is not relevant to national security or civil liberties, so I'll put it at 0.\n*   Economic Regulation: This involves government control of land, so I'll put it at +1.\n*   Social Inclusion: This benefits a specific group (Native Americans), so I'll put it at +2.\n\nRevised scores:\n*   Ideological Tilt: +1 (Slightly Liberal)\n*   Immigration Approach: 0 (Balanced/Selective)\n*   Executive Power: +2 (Slightly Expands Executive Authority)\n*   Federalism: +3 (Slightly Strong Federal Control)\n*   National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0 (Balanced Approach)\n*   Economic Regulation: +1 (Slightly Heavy Government Intervention)\n*   Social Inclusion: +2 (Emphasis on Diversity/Pluralism)",
