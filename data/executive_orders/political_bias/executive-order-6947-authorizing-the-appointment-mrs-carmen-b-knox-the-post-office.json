    "critique": "This is an executive order granting an exception to civil service rules for a specific individual, Mrs. Carmen B. Knox, to be appointed as a clerk in the Post Office Department. The rationale is based on her qualifications, her late husband's service, and her own prior service. There is minimal ideological content. Immigration is not directly addressed, though her language skills are noted. Executive power is slightly expanded in granting an exception. Federalism is not relevant. National security vs. civil liberties is not a major factor. Economic regulation is not directly addressed. Social inclusion is somewhat promoted by considering her qualifications and circumstances.",
