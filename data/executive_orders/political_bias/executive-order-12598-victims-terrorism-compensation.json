    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the delegation of presidential functions related to the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 to the Secretaries of State and Defense. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power expansion, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The delegation of power could be seen as a slight reduction in executive power at the presidential level, but it's more of a redistribution of existing power within the executive branch.",
