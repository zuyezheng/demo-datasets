It aims to heighten public awareness, encourage states to address the issue systematically, promote the use of effective techniques, and generate support for enforcing drunk driving laws. The order emphasizes cooperation between federal and state entities, utilizing federal resources to aid state efforts without directly mandating specific policies. The initiative is temporary, with the commission set to terminate after one year.",
