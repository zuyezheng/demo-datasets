    "critique": "This document repeals executive orders related to military punishments during wartime. It suggests a shift away from wartime stringency. Ideologically, this is difficult to place, but could be seen as a return to normalcy after a period of exception. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is slightly reduced by repealing the orders. Federalism is not directly implicated. Civil liberties are somewhat enhanced by reducing potential punishments. Economic regulation is not relevant. Social inclusion is not directly addressed.",
