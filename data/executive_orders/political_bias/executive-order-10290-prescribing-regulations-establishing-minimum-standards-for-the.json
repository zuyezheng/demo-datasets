    "critique": "This document establishes a system for safeguarding official information to protect national security. It defines categories of classified information, sets standards for handling and transmission, and assigns responsibilities for security. The document prioritizes national security, potentially at the expense of civil liberties, and expands executive power by centralizing control over classified information within the Executive Branch. There is no mention of immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document is moderately conservative in its emphasis on national security and government control of information.",
