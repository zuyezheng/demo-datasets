    "critique": "The document concerns the transfer of the office of Treasurer of the Island of Cuba to the jurisdiction of the Department of Finance of said Island, and that the position shall be filled by a citizen of Cuba. This indicates a move towards greater Cuban autonomy. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The federalism axis is difficult to assess, but it seems to be a move towards greater local control, so I will give it a slightly negative score.",
