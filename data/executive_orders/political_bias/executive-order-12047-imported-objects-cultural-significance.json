    "critique": "The document delegates authority to the Director of the International Communication Agency to determine the cultural significance and national interest of imported art, consults with other government officials, and revokes a previous executive order. There is no shift in immigration approach, security vs liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document does not explicitly expand executive power but delegates existing presidential functions. The document does not explicitly address federalism.",
