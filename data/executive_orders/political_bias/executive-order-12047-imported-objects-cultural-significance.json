    "critique": "This executive order concerns the temporary import of culturally significant objects. It delegates presidential authority to the Director of the International Communication Agency to make determinations about cultural significance and national interest. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It seems to centralize some authority within the executive branch but doesn't drastically expand executive power. It has no direct impact on economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
