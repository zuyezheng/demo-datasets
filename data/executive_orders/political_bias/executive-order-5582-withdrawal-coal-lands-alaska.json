    "critique": "This document is an executive order from Herbert Hoover withdrawing land from settlement for investigation and classification. It's a fairly straightforward administrative action. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. However, the act of withdrawing land could be seen as a slight intervention, so I will give a small positive score for economic regulation. The order itself doesn't expand executive power, it just uses existing authority.",
