    "critique": "This document pertains to the transfer of land and equipment related to the Safford National Wildlife Refuge from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior. It is based on the authority of the National Industrial Recovery Act. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism concerns, national security vs. civil liberties issues, economic regulation implications, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The transfer of land from one department to another doesn't inherently expand executive power.",
