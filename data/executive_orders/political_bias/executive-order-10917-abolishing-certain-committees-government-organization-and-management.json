    "critique": "This document is an executive order that abolishes two advisory committees and transfers their functions to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The transfer of functions to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget could be seen as a slight centralization of power, but it's not a significant shift.",
