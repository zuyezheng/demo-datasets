    "critique": "The document establishes the Peace Corps, which is generally seen as a liberal initiative focused on international cooperation and aid.  It delegates authority to the Secretary of State and the Director of the Peace Corps, but doesn't dramatically expand executive power beyond what's necessary to create and run the agency. It doesn't directly address immigration, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation. It promotes social inclusion by sending Americans abroad to assist other nations. It centralizes authority at the federal level to manage the Peace Corps.",
