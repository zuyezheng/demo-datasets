    "critique": "This document amends a previous executive order regarding the safeguarding of official information related to national defense. It primarily focuses on clarifying procedures for declassification and access to classified information, particularly for historical research. There is a slight tilt towards national security, but it also includes provisions for historical research access, suggesting a balance. The changes appear procedural and do not drastically alter the balance of power or ideological direction. Therefore, the initial scores reflect a moderate stance on most axes.",
