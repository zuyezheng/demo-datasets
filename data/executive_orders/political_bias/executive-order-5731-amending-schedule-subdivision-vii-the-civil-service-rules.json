    "critique": "The document is an amendment to civil-service rules regarding temporary postal workers for the holiday season. It is a short, factual statement with no overt political bias. The changes in scores reflect a very slight shift towards federal control due to the amendment being issued at the federal level, and a neutral stance on all other axes due to the non-political nature of the document.",
