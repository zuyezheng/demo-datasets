    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Defense Meritorious Service Medal. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The act of creating a medal could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's primarily an administrative action within the existing framework of the military and defense apparatus.",
