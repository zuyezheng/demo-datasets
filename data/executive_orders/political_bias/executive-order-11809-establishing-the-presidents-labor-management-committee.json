    "critique": "This executive order establishes a Labor-Management Committee to advise the President on policies related to collective bargaining, industrial peace, wage and price policies, productivity, and economic well-being. It encourages the establishment of labor-management committees in various sectors and directs federal agencies to cooperate with the Committee. There is nothing about immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the focus on labor and collective bargaining. The economic regulation is moderately interventionist due to the focus on wage and price policies and productivity. The initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 2, Immigration: 0, Executive Power: 0, Federalism: 0, Security/Liberty: 0, Economic Regulation: 3, Social Inclusion: 0. Revised scores are: Ideological Tilt: 2, Immigration: 0, Executive Power: 0, Federalism: 0, Security/Liberty: 0, Economic Regulation: 3, Social Inclusion: 0.",
