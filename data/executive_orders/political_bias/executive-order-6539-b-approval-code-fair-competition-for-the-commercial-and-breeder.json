    "critique": "This document is an executive order by Franklin D. Roosevelt approving a Code of Fair Competition for the Commercial and Breeder Hatchery Industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It's a straightforward approval based on findings of compliance with the Act. Ideologically, it leans liberal due to the interventionist nature of the NIRA. There's no direct impact on immigration, executive power is expanded due to the broad authority granted by the NIRA, federalism is strengthened as the federal government is setting industry standards, there's no clear impact on national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation is heavily interventionist, and social inclusion isn't directly addressed.",
