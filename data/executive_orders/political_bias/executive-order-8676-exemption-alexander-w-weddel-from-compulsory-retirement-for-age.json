    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts an ambassador from compulsory retirement. It does not seem to have any implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it seems to affect is executive power, as it expands the executive's authority to make exceptions to retirement rules. Therefore, the initial scores are ideological tilt: 0, immigration: 0, executive power: 3, federalism: 0, national security vs. civil liberties: 0, economic regulation: 0, and social inclusion: 0. After further consideration, I don't think this is a strong expansion of executive power, so I will revise that score to 1.",
