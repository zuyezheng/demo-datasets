    "critique": "This document is an amendment to a previous executive order that establishes the Interdepartmental Highway Safety Board. It primarily deals with the composition of the board, specifically who the members are. There is little to no information about ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral.",
