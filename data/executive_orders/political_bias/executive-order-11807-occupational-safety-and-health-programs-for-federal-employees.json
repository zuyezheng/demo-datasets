    "critique": "This executive order focuses on workplace safety and health for federal employees. It mandates agencies to establish and maintain safety programs, provides guidance from the Secretary of Labor, and continues the Federal Safety Advisory Council. There's a slight tilt towards government intervention in ensuring worker safety, but it doesn't drastically alter the economic landscape. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power in a significant way, or federalism. It leans towards prioritizing worker safety, which can be seen as a civil liberty, but it's primarily focused on a safe working environment. It doesn't directly address social inclusion or diversity. Therefore, the scores should reflect a moderate interventionist approach to worker safety without significant implications for other axes.",
