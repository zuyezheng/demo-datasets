    "critique": "This executive order establishes financial administration offices (Auditor and Treasurer) in Cuba and other West Indies islands under U.S. military government following Spain's evacuation. It centralizes financial control under the Secretary of War, with appointments and oversight from the U.S. government. There is no clear ideological tilt. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is expanded in the newly acquired territories. Federalism is not directly relevant as these are not states. National security is a consideration given the military government context. Economic regulation is increased through the establishment of financial offices. Social inclusion is not directly addressed.",
