    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the delegation of presidential authority regarding military appointments and promotions to the Secretary of Defense. It does not directly address issues related to ideological tilt, immigration, economic regulation, social inclusion, or security vs. liberty. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The main focus is on executive power and federalism, with a slight shift towards expanding executive authority within the Department of Defense and potentially centralizing some decision-making at the federal level.",
