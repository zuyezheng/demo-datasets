    "critique": "The document delegates authority to the Secretary of Defense and outlines procedures for placing positions within the Department of Defense into specific grades. There is little to no information available about the document's stance on topics such as immigration, ideological tilt, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the axes will be set to neutral (0). The exception is executive power, which is rated +1 as it delegates power, slightly expanding executive authority.",
