    "critique": "The document primarily concerns the wages and employment conditions of non-citizen employees of the Panama Canal and Panama Railroad Company. It authorizes the Governor of The Panama Canal to increase the rate of compensation for a limited number of these employees, while also clarifying their leave privileges. The order also revokes previous executive orders related to compensation increases for certain employees. There is minimal information available to assess ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion.",
