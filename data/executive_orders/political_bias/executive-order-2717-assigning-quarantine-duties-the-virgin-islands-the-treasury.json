    "critique": "The document centralizes power in the federal government, specifically the Secretary of the Treasury, to manage quarantine services in the Virgin Islands. It expands executive power by authorizing the President to order the transfer of public property and administrative duties. The document also leans towards prioritizing security (quarantine) over individual liberties.",
