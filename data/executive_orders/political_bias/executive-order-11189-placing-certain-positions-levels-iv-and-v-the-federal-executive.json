It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. However, the inclusion of positions related to equal opportunity and community relations might suggest a slight lean towards social inclusion.",
