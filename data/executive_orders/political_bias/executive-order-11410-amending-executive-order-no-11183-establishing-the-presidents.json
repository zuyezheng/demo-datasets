    "critique": "This document is a very minor amendment to an existing executive order, simply changing how the chairman of a commission is selected. It's difficult to assign strong political biases based on this. It has almost no implications for immigration, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It has a very slight impact on executive power and federalism, but not enough to warrant a strong score.",
