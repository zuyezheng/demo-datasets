    "critique": "The document discusses changes to customs field organizations, specifically abolishing the Tennessee district and reassigning its responsibilities to Kentucky and Missouri. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes are neutral. The shift of customs authority could be interpreted as a slight move towards federal control.",
