    "critique": "This document establishes regulations for deposit money orders issued by the Canal Zone Postal Service. It outlines interest rates and payment terms for these orders, and authorizes the Governor to prescribe further regulations. There is minimal ideological content. It is difficult to assess its impact on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The document does involve government in economic matters by setting interest rates, but this is limited to a specific context. The document does not seem to expand executive power significantly, as it mainly clarifies existing regulations and delegates authority to the Governor for implementation. It is difficult to assess its impact on federalism. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
