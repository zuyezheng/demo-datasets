    "critique": "This executive order addresses drug shortages and directs the FDA to take steps to prevent and reduce disruptions in the supply of life-saving medicines. It aims to ensure adequate advance notice of manufacturing discontinuances, expedite regulatory reviews, and review behaviors by market participants that could exacerbate shortages. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. The order does not directly address immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by directing the FDA to take certain actions, but it also includes provisions that limit its scope and ensure it is implemented consistent with applicable law. It does not appear to significantly impact federalism. It balances national security (in terms of public health) with civil liberties by ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the drug supply. It involves government intervention in the economy to address drug shortages. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
