    "critique": "This document outlines regulations for the transportation of household goods for government employees. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only possible exception might be economic regulation, where the government is setting rules for reimbursement, but this is a very minor intervention.",
