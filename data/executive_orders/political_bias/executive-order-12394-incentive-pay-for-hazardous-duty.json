    "critique": "This executive order pertains to defining hazardous duty for military personnel and adjusting pay scales accordingly. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. There's a very slight lean towards national security due to its focus on military operations, but it's minimal.",
