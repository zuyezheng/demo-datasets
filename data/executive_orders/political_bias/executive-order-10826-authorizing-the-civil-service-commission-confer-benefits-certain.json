It addresses situations where an employee becomes ineligible for a benefit due to administrative error and allows the Civil Service Commission to rectify the situation. It also clarifies that receiving a benefit under this order does not retroactively affect prior personnel actions. The order revokes a previous executive order on the same subject.",
