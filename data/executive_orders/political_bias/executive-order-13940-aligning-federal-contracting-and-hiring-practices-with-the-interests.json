    "critique": "This executive order prioritizes US workers and aims to prevent adverse effects on their wages and working conditions due to the employment of foreign labor. It directs agencies to review contracting and hiring practices, focusing on the use of temporary foreign labor and offshoring, and to propose actions to improve federal procurement and protect national security. It also instructs the Secretaries of Labor and Homeland Security to protect US workers from adverse effects caused by H-1B visa holders. The order emphasizes compliance with existing laws and does not create new enforceable rights.",
