    "critique": "This executive order withdraws public lands in California for use by the War Department during World War II. It prioritizes national security by establishing a depot. There is no direct impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is neutral as it is a wartime measure. The order does not obviously expand executive power, as it explicitly states the land will be returned to the Department of Interior when no longer needed.",
