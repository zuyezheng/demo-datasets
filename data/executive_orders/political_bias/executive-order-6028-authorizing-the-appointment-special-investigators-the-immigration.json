    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1933 that allows the Secretary of Labor to appoint special investigators in the Immigration Service without regard to civil service rules. It seems to be a fairly specific action related to personnel management. Ideological Tilt: This is hard to gauge, but given the time period and the nature of the order, it doesn't strongly lean one way or the other. Immigration Approach: It relates to the Immigration Service, but doesn't obviously restrict or open immigration. Executive Power: It expands executive power slightly by bypassing civil service rules for these appointments. Federalism: It doesn't seem to have a strong impact on federalism. National Security vs. Civil Liberties: It could be argued that bypassing civil service rules slightly impacts civil liberties, but it's not a major concern. Economic Regulation: It doesn't directly relate to economic regulation. Social Inclusion: It doesn't seem to have a direct impact on social inclusion. Revised scores: I've adjusted the executive power score to be slightly more positive, and the civil liberties score to be slightly more negative to reflect the bypassing of civil service rules.",
