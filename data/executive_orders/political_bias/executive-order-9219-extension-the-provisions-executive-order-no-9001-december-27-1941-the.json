    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the prosecution of the war effort during World War II. It extends the provisions of a previous executive order to the Office of Scientific Research and Development, granting its director powers similar to those of the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Chairman of the United States Maritime Commission. Given the context of wartime, several axes are affected. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on a left-right spectrum, but the expansion of executive power is evident. Immigration is not directly addressed. Federalism is tilted towards federal control due to the centralization of war efforts. National security is prioritized. Economic regulation is increased due to the war effort. Social inclusion is not directly addressed.",
