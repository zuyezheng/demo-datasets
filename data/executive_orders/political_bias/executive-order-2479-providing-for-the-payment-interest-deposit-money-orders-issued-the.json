    "critique": "The document focuses on a very specific financial matter (interest rates on postal money orders in the Canal Zone) and delegation of rule-making authority. It doesn't touch on broad ideological or social issues, so most axes should be neutral. The delegation of authority to the Governor of The Panama Canal could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power within that specific context.",
