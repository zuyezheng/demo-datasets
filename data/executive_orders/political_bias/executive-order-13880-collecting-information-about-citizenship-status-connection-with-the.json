    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on gathering citizenship data through administrative records after the Supreme Court blocked the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 census. It argues that accurate citizenship data is essential for understanding the effects of immigration, informing immigration policy, evaluating public benefits programs, and generating a more reliable count of the unauthorized alien population. The order directs agencies to share administrative records with the Department of Commerce and establishes an interagency working group to improve access to these records. It also directs the Secretary of Commerce to consider including a citizenship question on the 2030 census and expanding citizenship data collection in other surveys.",
