    "critique": "This executive order aims to gather citizenship data through administrative records after the Supreme Court blocked the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 census. It argues that this data is crucial for understanding the effects of immigration, evaluating public benefits programs, and estimating the unauthorized alien population. The order directs agencies to share data with the Department of Commerce and establishes an interagency working group to improve access to administrative records. It also directs the Secretary of Commerce to consider including a citizenship question on the 2030 census and expanding data-gathering efforts. The order emphasizes that the data will be used for statistical purposes and not for immigration enforcement actions. The document reflects a conservative stance on immigration, emphasizing the need to understand the effects of immigration and control public benefits for aliens. It also expands executive power by directing agencies to share data and establishing an interagency working group. It centralizes power in the federal government by directing state agencies to share data. It also prioritizes national security by focusing on immigration.",
