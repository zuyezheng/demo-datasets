    "critique": "This executive order concerns the revocation of a previous order withdrawing public lands in Wyoming and opening them to entry under homestead or desert land laws, prioritizing ex-service men of the War with Germany for a period of 91 days. After that period, the land becomes available to the general public. There is nothing to suggest a liberal or conservative ideological tilt. The order does show a slight preference towards a specific group (ex-service men) for a limited time, but it's not a major social inclusion issue. It doesn't significantly impact executive power, federalism, national security, or economic regulation. Immigration is not mentioned.",
