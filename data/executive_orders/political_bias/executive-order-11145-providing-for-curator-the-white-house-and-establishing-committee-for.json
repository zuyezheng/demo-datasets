    "critique": "The document focuses on preserving the historic and artistic contents of the White House, establishing a committee and a curator for this purpose. It emphasizes the White House as a symbol of American democracy and a public museum. There is no clear indication of a liberal or conservative stance, nor any discussion of immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are set to neutral across all axes.",
