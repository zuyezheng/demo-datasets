    "critique": "This document is a presidential order from 1940 that sets aside land in Virginia for military purposes. It is a very specific action, and it is difficult to assess its ideological tilt. It does expand executive power by setting aside land. It also centralizes power in the federal government. It has a national security focus. It has no impact on economic regulation or social inclusion. It has no impact on immigration.",
