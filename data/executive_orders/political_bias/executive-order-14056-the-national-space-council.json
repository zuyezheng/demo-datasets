    "critique": "This executive order establishes and defines the functions of the National Space Council. It primarily focuses on coordinating space policy and strategy across various government agencies. There's no direct indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It doesn't significantly expand executive power, as it mainly formalizes an advisory role. The order doesn't seem to heavily favor either state or federal control, nor does it directly address economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The inclusion of climate considerations might suggest a slight liberal tilt, but it's not substantial enough to warrant a high score.",
