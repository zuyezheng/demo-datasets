    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the order of succession within the Department of Homeland Security. It amends a previous executive order and revokes another. There is nothing inherently liberal or conservative about establishing an order of succession. It does not directly address immigration, though some of the positions listed relate to immigration enforcement. It clarifies the line of succession, but does not expand executive power, as it is simply defining who takes over if the Secretary is unable to perform their duties. It does not obviously shift power between the federal government and the states. It does not obviously prioritize national security over civil liberties, or vice versa. It does not directly regulate the economy. It does not promote or discourage social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
