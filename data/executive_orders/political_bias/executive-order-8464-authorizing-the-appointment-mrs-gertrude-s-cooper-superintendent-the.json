    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1940 allowing Mrs. Gertrude S. Cooper to be appointed to a position without following Civil Service Rules. Given that this is a specific exception for one person, it's hard to place it definitively on a liberal-conservative scale. It could be seen as slightly conservative in the sense that it deviates from established rules, but it's more about a specific case. There's no direct impact on immigration, executive power in general, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a broad sense. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. The exception to civil service rules could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power in this specific instance, but it's very limited.",
