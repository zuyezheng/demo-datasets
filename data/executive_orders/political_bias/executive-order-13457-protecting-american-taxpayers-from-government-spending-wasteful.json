    "critique": "This executive order aims to reduce earmarks and increase transparency in government spending. It directs executive agencies to base funding decisions on statutory criteria and merit-based decision-making, rather than on congressional earmarks or communications. It also requires agencies to make public any written communications from Congress recommending funds for earmarks. The order seeks to ensure judicious use of taxpayer dollars and prevent circumvention of established allocation processes.\n\nIdeological Tilt: The order promotes fiscal responsibility and transparency, which could be seen as aligning with both conservative and moderate viewpoints. However, the emphasis on merit-based decision-making and reducing earmarks could be interpreted as a move away from pork-barrel spending, a common target of conservative critiques. I will score this as slightly conservative.\nImmigration Approach: This order does not address immigration.\nExecutive Power: The order directs executive agencies to adhere to certain procedures and criteria in allocating funds, potentially limiting their discretion in some cases. However, it also asserts the executive branch's authority to manage the funds allocation process and prevent congressional circumvention. I will score this as neutral.\nFederalism: The order does not directly address the balance of power between the federal government and the states.\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: This order does not address national security or civil liberties.\nEconomic Regulation: The order aims to reduce earmarks and promote merit-based decision-making in government spending, which could be seen as a move towards greater efficiency and accountability in the use of taxpayer dollars. This could be interpreted as a form of deregulation or reduced government intervention in the economy. I will score this as slightly deregulatory.\nSocial Inclusion: This order does not address social inclusion.\n\nRevised Scores:\nIdeological Tilt: -1 (Slightly Conservative)\nImmigration Approach: 0 (Neutral)\nExecutive Power: 0 (Neutral)\nFederalism: 0 (Neutral)\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0 (Neutral)\nEconomic Regulation: -1 (Slightly Deregulatory)\nSocial Inclusion: 0 (Neutral)",
