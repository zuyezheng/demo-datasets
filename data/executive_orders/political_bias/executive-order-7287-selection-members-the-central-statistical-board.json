    "critique": "The document establishes the Central Statistical Board and outlines the selection process for its members. It specifies the roles of various government officials in designating members and includes provisions for elected members, ensuring representation from both within and outside the federal government. The order also details the terms of membership, conditions for vacancy, and procedures for filling vacancies. There is no mentioning of immigration, civil liberties, or diversity. The document seems to be expanding the power of the executive branch.",
