    "critique": "This executive order primarily concerns the internal processes for presidential review of Department of Transportation decisions related to the Federal Aviation Act. It revokes a previous order and establishes procedures for inter-agency communication and review, particularly focusing on national defense and foreign relations implications. There's an emphasis on transparency through public dockets, but also allowances for confidentiality in defense and foreign policy matters. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or social inclusion. It seems to streamline a process rather than drastically shifting power dynamics. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with slight leanings where relevant.",
