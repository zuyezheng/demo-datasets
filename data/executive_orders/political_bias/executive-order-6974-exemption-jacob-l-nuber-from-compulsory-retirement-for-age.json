    "critique": "This is an executive order that makes an exception to a rule about mandatory retirement age for government employees. It extends the service of one particular employee, Jacob L. Nuber. There is nothing inherently liberal or conservative about this. It does give the executive branch more power, but only in a very limited way. It doesn't really touch on immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the axes should be scored as neutral.",
