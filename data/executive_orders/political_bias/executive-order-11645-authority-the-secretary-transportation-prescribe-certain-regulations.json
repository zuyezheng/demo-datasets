    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of Transportation (or the Commandant of the Coast Guard) to prescribe regulations related to the designation and leasing of rental housing for the Coast Guard. It also clarifies that when the Coast Guard operates as a service in the Navy, the Secretary of the Navy assumes this authority. There is nothing about ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that this touches on is executive power, and it is a slight expansion of executive power through delegation.",
