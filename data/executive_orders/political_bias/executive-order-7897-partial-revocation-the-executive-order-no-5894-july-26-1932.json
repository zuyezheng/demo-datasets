    "critique": "This document concerns the revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in Colorado pending a resurvey. It specifies townships and states that the order becomes effective upon the official filing of resurvey plats. There's no indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion or restriction, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, all axes should be scored as neutral.",
