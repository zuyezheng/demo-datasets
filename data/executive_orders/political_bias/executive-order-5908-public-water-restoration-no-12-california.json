    "critique": "This document primarily concerns land allocation and water rights, specifically revoking a previous order to allow for a conduit for water from the Colorado River to Los Angeles. It's a very specific, localized issue with minimal bearing on broad political themes. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. There's a slight tilt towards federalism as it involves federal land and interstate water management, and a very slight lean towards economic intervention as it facilitates a large-scale infrastructure project.",
