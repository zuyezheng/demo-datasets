    "critique": "This executive order temporarily suspends a service-in-grade requirement for Marine Corps captains to be eligible for promotion. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It has a slight impact on executive power, federalism, economic regulation, and social inclusion. It centralizes decision-making related to military promotions within the executive branch, reflecting a slight expansion of executive power. The order does not directly relate to economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes should be neutral.",
