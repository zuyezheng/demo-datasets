    "critique": "This document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in New Mexico. It's a simple administrative action with minimal political implications. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The federalism aspect might lean slightly towards state control as it returns land management to the status quo, potentially giving the state more influence.",
