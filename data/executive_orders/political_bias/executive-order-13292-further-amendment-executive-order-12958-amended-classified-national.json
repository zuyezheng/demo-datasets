    "critique": "This executive order establishes a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information. It aims to balance the need for government transparency with the protection of sensitive information critical to national security, including defense against transnational terrorism. The order outlines classification standards, levels, and authority, as well as procedures for declassification and safeguarding. It also establishes an Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel. The order seems to expand executive power by centralizing classification authority and potentially limiting the release of information to the public. It also leans towards prioritizing national security over civil liberties by emphasizing the protection of classified information. There is no direct impact on immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is slightly conservative due to the emphasis on national security and executive authority.",
