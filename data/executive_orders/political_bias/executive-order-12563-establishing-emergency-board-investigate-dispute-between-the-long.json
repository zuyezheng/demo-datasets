    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between the Long Island Rail Road and its employees. It is based on the Railway Labor Act. There is nothing in the document to suggest a liberal or conservative bias. The document does not address immigration. The document does not expand executive power beyond what is already provided for in the Railway Labor Act. The document does not address federalism. The document does not address national security or civil liberties. The document involves the government in labor relations, which could be seen as a form of economic intervention, but it is a fairly standard procedure under the Railway Labor Act. The document does not address social inclusion.",
