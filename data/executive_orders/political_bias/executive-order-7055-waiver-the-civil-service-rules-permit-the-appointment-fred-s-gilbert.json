    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1935 that allows an individual to be appointed to a position without complying with civil service rules. Given the time period, this likely does not have a strong ideological tilt. It does not deal with immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
