    "critique": "The document establishes fishery conservation zones and tasks the Secretaries of State and Interior with recommending the establishment of these zones via Executive Orders. It focuses on the management and regulation of fishery resources. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or social inclusion. The executive power is somewhat expanded as it directs the Secretaries to recommend actions. Federalism is strengthened as it centralizes control over fisheries. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly addressed. Economic regulation is present as it regulates fishing activities.",
