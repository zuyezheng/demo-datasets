    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 that allows Mrs. Hilda McTeer to be appointed to a position in the classified service of the Government without compliance with the requirements of the civil-service rules. This is because she is the widow of John H. McTeer, who had long and meritorious service in the Treasury Department, and who died leaving his widow and a minor child without adequate means of support. Mrs. McTeer has also served a number of years under temporary appointments in the Treasury Department and other branches of the Government service. The order is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nIdeological Tilt: This is a difficult one. It could be argued that this is a liberal policy, as it is helping a widow and child in need. However, it could also be argued that it is a conservative policy, as it is based on the idea of family values and helping those who have served the government. I will score it as slightly liberal.\nImmigration Approach: This document does not deal with immigration.\nExecutive Power: This document expands executive power, as it allows the President to bypass the civil-service rules.\nFederalism: This document does not deal with federalism.\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: This document does not deal with national security or civil liberties.\nEconomic Regulation: This document does not deal with economic regulation.\nSocial Inclusion: This document could be seen as promoting social inclusion, as it is helping a woman in need. However, it could also be seen as promoting conformity, as it is based on the idea of family values. I will score it as neutral.\n\nRevised Scores:\nIdeological Tilt: I am revising my score to be more neutral, as the document could be seen as both liberal and conservative.\nExecutive Power: I am revising my score to be slightly less expansive, as the document is based on a specific set of circumstances.\n",
