    "critique": "This document is a simple amendment to civil service rules, adding a position that can be filled without competitive examination. It's difficult to assess its ideological tilt, immigration approach, impact on executive power, federalism implications, or effect on national security vs. civil liberties. It seems to have a very slight impact on economic regulation and social inclusion, but not enough to warrant a strong score. Therefore, most scores will be near zero.",
