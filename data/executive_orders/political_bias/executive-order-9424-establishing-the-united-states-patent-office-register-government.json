    "critique": "The document focuses on establishing a patent register within the Department of Commerce. It centralizes the recording of government patent rights and interests, potentially increasing federal oversight. There is no direct impact on civil liberties, immigration, or social issues. The order seems neutral regarding economic regulation, as it primarily deals with administrative organization.",
