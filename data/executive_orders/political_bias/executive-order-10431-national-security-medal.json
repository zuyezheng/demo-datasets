    "critique": "This executive order establishes the National Security Medal. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by creating a new medal to be awarded at the president's discretion, and it leans towards national security by recognizing contributions to intelligence. There is no clear impact on federalism or social inclusion.",
