    "critique": "This executive order adds the Environmental Protection Agency to several river basin commissions. This seems to have a slight liberal tilt as it increases environmental oversight. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion, so those should be neutral. The addition of the EPA could be seen as a slight increase in federal power, but it is not significant enough to warrant a strong score.",
