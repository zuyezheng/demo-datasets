    "critique": "The document discusses the appointment of Miss Edith M. Watkins to a classified position in the Department of Justice without compliance with Civil Service Rules. This could be seen as an expansion of executive power, as it bypasses standard procedures. However, it is also presented as a recognition of her long and capable service. The order is recommended by the Attorney General, suggesting some level of oversight.",
