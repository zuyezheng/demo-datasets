    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the reinstatement of veterans into classified civil service positions after their military service. It aims to provide job security and opportunities for veterans, ensuring they can return to similar positions with acquired civil-service status. The order does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards social inclusion due to the support for veterans, but this is a stretch.",
