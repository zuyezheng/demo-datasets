    "critique": "This executive order focuses on improving the nation's cybersecurity posture by mandating better information sharing, modernizing federal government cybersecurity, enhancing software supply chain security, establishing a cyber safety review board, standardizing incident response, improving detection of vulnerabilities, and improving investigative capabilities. It largely focuses on federal agencies and contractors. There is little to suggest a liberal or conservative bent. It does not touch on immigration. It expands executive power to direct agencies to take certain actions. It centralizes authority at the federal level. It balances security and liberty by mandating protections for privacy and civil liberties. It involves government intervention in the economy by setting cybersecurity standards. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
