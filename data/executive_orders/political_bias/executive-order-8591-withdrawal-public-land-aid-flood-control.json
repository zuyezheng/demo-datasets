    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1940 that withdraws public lands in Arkansas for the construction of the Norfork Dam and Reservoir. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, or civil liberties. It does relate to federalism and economic regulation, as it involves the federal government taking control of land for a public works project. There is no indication of social inclusion or exclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with slight adjustments for federalism and economic regulation.",
