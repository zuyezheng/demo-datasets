    "critique": "This document pertains to an amendment regarding civil service rules within the Post Office Department. It specifically addresses the exemption of certain positions from civil service requirements. Given the limited scope and focus on internal administrative matters, the document does not directly address broader ideological or political issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The change increases the power of the Postmaster General slightly, so executive power is slightly expanded.",
