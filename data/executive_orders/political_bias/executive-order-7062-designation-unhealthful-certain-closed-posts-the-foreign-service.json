    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1935 adding several locations to a list of \"unhealthful posts\" for consular offices. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt (liberal vs. conservative) as the context is very specific and relates to the health and safety of consular staff. There's no clear indication of immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, or national security concerns. Economic regulation and social inclusion are also not directly addressed. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral. The act of listing 'unhealthy posts' could be seen as a form of worker protection, so I will give a small positive score to economic regulation. I will revise this to be neutral, as it is not directly related to economic regulation.",
