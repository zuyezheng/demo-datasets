    "critique": "This document pertains to the Missouri Basin Survey Commission and adjusts the reporting deadline. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The adjustment of the reporting deadline could be seen as a very slight expansion of executive efficiency, but it's minimal.",
