    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the preservation and display of flags captured from enemies during wartime. It directs the Secretary of the Navy to deposit these flags in the U.S. Naval Academy and, under specific conditions, in the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. The order also supersedes a previous order from 1849. Given the subject matter, the document has minimal implications for most of the axes. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The strongest relevance is to national security, as it deals with symbols of military conflict, but even this is indirect. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards national security.",
