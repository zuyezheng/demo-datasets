    "critique": "This document delegates presidential authority to the Secretary of the Interior, specifically concerning matters related to land management, Indian affairs, and territories. There is a slight increase in executive power at the Secretary level, but a decrease at the presidential level. The document does not directly address economic regulation, social inclusion, immigration, or security/liberty concerns. It has a slight impact on federalism by shifting some federal responsibilities.",
