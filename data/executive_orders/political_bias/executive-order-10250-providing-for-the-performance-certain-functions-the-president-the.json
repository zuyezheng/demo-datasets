    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the delegation of presidential authority to the Secretary of the Interior, specifically regarding matters related to land management, Indian affairs, and territories like Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, national security, or economic regulation in a substantive way. The focus is on administrative efficiency and delegation of existing powers. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The executive power axis leans slightly towards restraint, as it delegates authority, but it's a delegation within the executive branch, so it's not a strong restraint.",
