    "critique": "This executive order pertains to a very specific and limited issue: the per diem allowance for enlisted men of the Navy and Marine Corps on duty in the American Embassy in Havana, Cuba, who are not furnished quarters or rations in kind. It adjusts the allowance amounts. Given the limited scope and focus on logistical details, it's difficult to assign strong scores on most of the axes. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, or impact on national security vs. civil liberties. The economic regulation aspect is minimal, dealing only with a small allowance adjustment. Similarly, social inclusion is not directly addressed. Therefore, most scores will be neutral, with a slight lean towards federal control due to the nature of military administration.",
