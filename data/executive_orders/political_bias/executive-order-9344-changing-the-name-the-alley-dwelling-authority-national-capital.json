    "critique": "This executive order changes the name of the Alley Dwelling Authority to the National Capital Housing Authority. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral. However, because it centralizes housing authority in the 'National Capital', it modestly increases federal control.",
