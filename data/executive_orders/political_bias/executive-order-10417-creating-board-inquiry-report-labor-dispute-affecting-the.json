    "critique": "This document establishes a Board of Inquiry to address a labor dispute at the American Locomotive Company. It invokes the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, suggesting a federal role in mediating labor issues that affect national safety. The document itself doesn't express a clear ideological stance, but the invocation of the Act implies a moderate level of government intervention in labor disputes. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
