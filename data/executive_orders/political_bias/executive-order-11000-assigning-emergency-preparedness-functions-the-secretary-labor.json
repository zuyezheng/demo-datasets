    "critique": "This executive order from 1962 focuses on national emergency preparedness, specifically concerning civilian manpower mobilization and related functions of the Department of Labor. It aims to develop plans and programs for effective utilization of manpower resources, wage and salary stabilization, worker incentives, and labor-management relations during a national emergency, including potential attacks on the United States. The order emphasizes interagency cooperation and coordination with the Office of Emergency Planning. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties in a way that would allow scoring, or social inclusion. The order delegates significant authority to the Secretary of Labor to prepare and implement these plans. The focus is very much on central planning and federal control in the event of a national emergency. There is a strong emphasis on government intervention in the economy (wage and salary stabilization). There is nothing to suggest a liberal or conservative ideological tilt. The order itself doesn't expand executive power, but prepares the ground for it in an emergency. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
