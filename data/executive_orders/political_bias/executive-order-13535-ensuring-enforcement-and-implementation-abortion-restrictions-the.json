    "critique": "This executive order reinforces the Hyde Amendment and aims to prevent federal funds from being used for abortion services, except in specific cases. It directs various agencies to ensure compliance and issue guidelines. The order does not directly address immigration, executive power beyond enforcement, federalism significantly, national security, economic regulation broadly, or social inclusion beyond the abortion issue. Therefore, the scores reflect this narrow focus.",
