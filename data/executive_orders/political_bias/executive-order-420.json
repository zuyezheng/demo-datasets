    "critique": "This document pertains to the remission of sentences for prisoners sentenced by military tribunals during the war. It is difficult to assess its position on the traditional left-right political spectrum. It does not directly address immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power, but it is also an act of clemency. It does not directly address federalism. It could be argued that it favors civil liberties by remitting sentences. It does not directly address economic regulation. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
