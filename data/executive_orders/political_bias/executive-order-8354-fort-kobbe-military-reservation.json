    "critique": "This document is an executive order that establishes a military reservation in the Canal Zone. It primarily deals with land management and jurisdictional issues within the Canal Zone. There is little to no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or social inclusion. The order does transfer control of the land to the Secretary of War, which could be interpreted as a slight expansion of executive power, but it also subjects the area to the civil jurisdiction of the Canal Zone Government, which balances this. The order also involves the federal government taking control of land, indicating a move towards federal primacy. There is no mention of national security or civil liberties. There is no economic regulation mentioned.",
