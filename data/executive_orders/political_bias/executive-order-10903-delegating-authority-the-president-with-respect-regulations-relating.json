    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the delegation of authority from the President to the Secretary of State regarding overseas differentials, allowances, and other benefits for government employees working abroad. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The delegation of authority could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's more about efficiency than a fundamental shift in power dynamics.",
