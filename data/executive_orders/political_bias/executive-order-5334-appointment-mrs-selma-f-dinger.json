    "critique": "This document is an executive order that waives civil service rules to appoint a specific person, Mrs. Selma F. Dinger, to a position in the War Department. The rationale is that she is the widow of a deceased Air Corps pilot. There is no clear ideological tilt, immigration aspect, or impact on federalism. It does not obviously expand executive power, as it is a one-time exception. It doesn't directly address national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a broad sense. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. However, one could argue that giving preferential treatment based on the service of a spouse leans slightly towards traditional values, so a small negative score on social inclusion might be appropriate.",
