    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1938 that allows one government employee to continue working past the retirement age. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of such a document, but it seems fairly neutral. Immigration is not addressed. The executive power is slightly expanded, as the president is making an exception to a rule. Federalism is not really addressed. National security vs. civil liberties is not addressed. Economic regulation is not really addressed, though it could be argued that keeping someone employed is a form of economic intervention. Social inclusion is not addressed.",
