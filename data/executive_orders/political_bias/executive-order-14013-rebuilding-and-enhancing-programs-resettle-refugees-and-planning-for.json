    "critique": "This executive order focuses on rebuilding and expanding the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). It revokes previous executive orders that restricted the program and aims to improve efficiency, security, and transparency. The order emphasizes treating applicants with dignity and respect, prioritizing family reunification, and enhancing access for vulnerable populations. It also addresses climate change as a driver of migration and seeks to improve the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) programs for Iraqi and Afghan allies. The order promotes diversity and inclusion, and aims to reduce delays in processing applications. It also calls for reports and reviews to improve the program's efficacy and integrity. It does not expand executive power, but rather directs agencies to improve existing programs. It also does not focus on economic regulation or federalism. Therefore, the ideological tilt is liberal, the immigration approach is open, and the social inclusion is diverse.",
