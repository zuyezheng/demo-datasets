    "critique": "This document revokes several executive orders related to the national emergency declared with respect to Haiti. It finds that the restoration of a democratically elected government in Haiti has ended the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The document terminates the national emergency and revokes the specified executive orders. It also includes standard language about actions or proceedings pending or based on prior acts. The document itself doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. However, the act of ending a national emergency could be seen as slightly leaning towards civil liberties. The revocation of executive orders could be seen as a slight restraint on executive power.",
