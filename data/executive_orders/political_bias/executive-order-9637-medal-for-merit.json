    "critique": "This document establishes the rules and regulations for awarding the Medal for Merit to civilians who have performed exceptionally meritorious service in the furtherance of the prosecution of the war. It establishes a board to review proposals and make recommendations to the President. There is nothing explicitly ideological in this document. It seems to expand executive power slightly by centralizing the award process under the President's direction. It is neutral on immigration, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion.",
