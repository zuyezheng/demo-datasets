It is primarily concerned with the internal management of the government and does not directly address any of the axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's no indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power beyond standard procedure, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion matters.",
