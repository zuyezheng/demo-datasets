    "critique": "This executive order from 1951 deals with the settlement of intercustodial conflicts involving enemy property. It designates the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to handle agreements related to this, pursuant to the Trading with the Enemy Act and the act of September 28, 1950. It outlines how they should cooperate and delegate functions. There's nothing inherently liberal or conservative about this; it's a legal and administrative matter. It doesn't directly impact immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by giving the Secretary of State and Attorney General broad authority, but it's within the scope of existing laws. It centralizes authority at the federal level, but this is expected for international agreements. It has a minor impact on economic regulation by dealing with property, but it's not a major intervention. Therefore, my initial scores are as follows:",
