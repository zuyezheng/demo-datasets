    "critique": "The document is an executive order designating INTERPOL as a public international organization entitled to certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The designation of INTERPOL could be seen as slightly expanding executive power, but it's a minor effect.",
