The focus on 'improper' and 'fraudulent' voting suggests a concern for voter fraud, which is often a Republican talking point, though the order itself is worded neutrally. The definitions provided for 'improper voter registration,' 'improper voting,' 'fraudulent voter registration,' and 'fraudulent voting' are objective. The commission is advisory and temporary. It does not expand executive power significantly, nor does it obviously favor states or the federal government. It doesn't directly address civil liberties or economic regulation. The emphasis on 'integrity' could be seen as leaning towards conformity in voting practices, but it's not explicit. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
