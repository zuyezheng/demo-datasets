It aims to prevent financial dealings with enemies or allies of enemies of the United States. The order establishes a system of registration and reporting for dealers in foreign exchange and securities, and it grants broad authority to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board to oversee and control these transactions. The document reflects a strong emphasis on national security and economic control during wartime.",
