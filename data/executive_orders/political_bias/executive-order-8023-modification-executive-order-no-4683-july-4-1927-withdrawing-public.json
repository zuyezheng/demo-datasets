    "critique": "This executive order modifies a previous order to allow settlers to enter land in Alaska that has been subdivided for town-site purposes. This seems to promote economic development and settlement of the territory. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism concerns, national security vs. civil liberties issues, economic regulation implications, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
