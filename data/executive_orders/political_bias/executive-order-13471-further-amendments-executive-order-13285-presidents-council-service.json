    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. It modifies a previous executive order by adding a quorum requirement for council meetings and extending the council's duration. It also includes a disclaimer clarifying that the order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits. Because this deals with the administration of a council, it does not have strong implications for any of the axes. The extension of the council could be seen as a very slight expansion of executive power, but it is minimal. The disclaimer is a slight restriction of executive power.",
