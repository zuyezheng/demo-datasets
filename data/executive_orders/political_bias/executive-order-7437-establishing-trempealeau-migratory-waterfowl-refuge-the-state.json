    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 that establishes a migratory bird refuge in Wisconsin. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on economic regulation by setting aside land, and a slight impact on federalism by designating federal land. It does not expand executive power in any significant way. It has no ideological tilt.",
