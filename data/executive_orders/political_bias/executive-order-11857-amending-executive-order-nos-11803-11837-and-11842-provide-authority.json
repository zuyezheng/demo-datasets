    "critique": "This document is a short amendment to an existing executive order, granting the President the power to appoint additional members to a board. It's difficult to assess its ideological tilt, immigration approach, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion implications, as it primarily deals with executive authority. The main focus is on the expansion of executive power. There is no clear indication of federalism implications. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral, with a positive score for executive power.",
