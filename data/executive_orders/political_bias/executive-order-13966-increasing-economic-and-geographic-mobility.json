    "critique": "This executive order focuses on reducing occupational licensing requirements to promote economic growth and worker mobility. It emphasizes deregulation and reducing burdens on individuals, particularly military spouses and those with criminal records. It encourages states to adopt less restrictive licensing practices and promotes reciprocity between states. The order does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism (though it encourages state action), national security, or social inclusion beyond the inclusion of military spouses and individuals with criminal records. Therefore, the scores reflect a focus on deregulation and a slight nod towards social inclusion.",
