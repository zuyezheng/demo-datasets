    "critique": "This document concerns the administration of the Canal Zone. It revokes a previous executive order placing land under the control of the Secretary of the Navy and returns it to the Governor of the Panama Canal. This appears to be an administrative matter with minimal ideological content. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's a slight shift of power from the Navy (federal) to the Governor (local), suggesting a minor move towards state control in this specific context.",
