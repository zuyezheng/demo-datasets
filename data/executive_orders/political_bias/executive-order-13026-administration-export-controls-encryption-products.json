    "critique": "This executive order deals with the export of encryption products. It aims to control the dissemination of encryption technology that could harm national security. Here's a breakdown of the axes:\n\n*   **Ideological Tilt:** The document doesn't directly address traditional left-right issues. It focuses on national security and export controls, making it difficult to place on the liberal-conservative spectrum. I'll give it a 0.\n*   **Immigration Approach:** This executive order has nothing to do with immigration, so I will give it a 0.\n*   **Executive Power:** The order expands executive power by limiting judicial review and granting the Secretary of Commerce discretion in considering foreign availability. It also allows for further presidential direction. I'll give it a +3.\n*   **Federalism:** The order doesn't significantly shift power between the federal government and the states, so I will give it a 0.\n*   **National Security vs. Civil Liberties:** The order prioritizes national security by controlling encryption exports, potentially limiting access to strong encryption for individuals and businesses. I'll give it a +3.\n*   **Economic Regulation:** The order involves government intervention in controlling the export of encryption products, which can be seen as a form of economic regulation. I'll give it a +2.\n*   **Social Inclusion:** The order doesn't directly address social inclusion issues. It's focused on national security and export controls, so I will give it a 0.\n\nRevised Scores:\nAfter further consideration, I believe the initial scores are appropriate and accurately reflect the document's focus on national security and export controls.",
