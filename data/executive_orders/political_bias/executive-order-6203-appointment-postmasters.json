    "critique": "This executive order from 1933 primarily deals with the process of appointing postmasters. It outlines the roles of the Postmaster General and the Civil Service Commission in filling vacancies, including provisions for renomination, competitive examinations, and veteran preferences. There's a focus on qualifications and procedures for selecting candidates. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, or economic regulation. It touches on federalism by involving both federal entities (Postmaster General and Civil Service Commission), but it doesn't drastically shift the balance of power. It also includes provisions related to veterans, which could be seen as a form of social inclusion, but it also has age restrictions. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
