    "critique": "The document is an executive order related to the National Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year, 1975. It focuses on increasing the number of members on the Commission. There is no explicit discussion of immigration, executive power, federalism, security, economic regulation, or social inclusion beyond gender. The document itself does not express strong opinions on any of the axes, but the topic of women's rights leans slightly liberal.",
