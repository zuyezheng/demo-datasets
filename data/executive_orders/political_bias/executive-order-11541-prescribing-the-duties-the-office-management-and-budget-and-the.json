    "critique": "This document is an executive order that reorganizes the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Council. It delegates certain functions from the President to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and outlines the responsibilities of the Domestic Council. There is nothing about immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It centralizes power in the executive branch, specifically within the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Council, which suggests a move towards federal primacy. There's no indication of economic regulation or deregulation. The document itself doesn't lean strongly on the traditional left-right spectrum.",
