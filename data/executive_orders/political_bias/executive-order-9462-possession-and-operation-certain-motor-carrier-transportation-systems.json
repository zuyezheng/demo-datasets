    "critique": "This is an executive order from Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II. It directs the Director of the Office of Defense Transportation to take control of various motor carrier transportation systems due to a labor disturbance that threatens the war effort. The order cites the President's powers under the Constitution, the act of August 29, 1916, the First War Powers Act, 1941, and section 9 of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 as amended by the War Labor Disputes Act. It prioritizes the war effort and national defense. It does not directly address immigration, economic regulation in a broad sense, or social inclusion. It does expand executive power in a time of war. It also centralizes control at the federal level. It also emphasizes national security over civil liberties.",
