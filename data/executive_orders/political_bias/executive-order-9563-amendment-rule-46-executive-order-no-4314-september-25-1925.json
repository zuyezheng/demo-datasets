    "critique": "This document pertains to a very specific and localized issue: the provision of meals to Panama Canal personnel aboard vessels. It amends a pre-existing rule regarding this matter. Given its narrow scope, it's difficult to assign strong scores on most of the axes. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion of executive power, or impact on federalism. It has a very slight impact on economic regulation, and no impact on national security vs. civil liberties or social inclusion.",
