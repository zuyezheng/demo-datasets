    "critique": "This document is a straightforward land withdrawal for the U.S. Navy. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The executive power is slightly expanded as the president is making this decision, but it is a normal function.",
