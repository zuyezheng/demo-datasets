    "critique": "The document focuses on providing opportunities for handicapped employees to obtain civil service competitive status. This suggests a focus on social inclusion and equal opportunity. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or economic regulation. However, the action of the president to amend Civil Service Rule 3.1 suggests a moderate level of executive power.",
