    "critique": "This document is an executive order that aims to provide civil service competitive status to severely physically handicapped and mentally retarded individuals who have completed at least two years of satisfactory service in a position excepted from the competitive service. This promotes social inclusion and diversity. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, or economic regulation impact. Therefore, most axes should be neutral, with a positive score for social inclusion.",
