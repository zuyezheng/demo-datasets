    "critique": "This executive order reorganizes the executive branch by consolidating agencies involved in enforcing internal revenue laws. It abolishes the Bureau of Industrial Alcohol and transfers its functions, along with some functions of the Attorney General related to the National Prohibition Act, to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. It also transfers records, property, personnel, and appropriations. The order aims to streamline enforcement and avoid duplication of effort. There is nothing particularly liberal or conservative about this; it seems like a matter of administrative efficiency. It does concentrate power in the executive branch, but it's hard to say if it significantly expands it. It doesn't touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It could be argued that consolidating agencies is a form of economic intervention, but it's very indirect. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
