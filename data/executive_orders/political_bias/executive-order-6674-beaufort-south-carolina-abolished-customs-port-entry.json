    "critique": "This document is an executive order that abolishes Beaufort, South Carolina as a customs port of entry. This seems like a fairly routine administrative action. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism concerns, national security vs. civil liberties issues, economic regulation implications, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
