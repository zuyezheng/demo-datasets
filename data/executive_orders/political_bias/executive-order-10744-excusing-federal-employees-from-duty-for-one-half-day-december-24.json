    "critique": "This executive order is a simple directive to excuse federal employees for half a day on the days preceding Christmas and New Year's Day in 1957. It includes exceptions for national security and other public reasons, as determined by department heads. There is nothing in this order that suggests a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, federalism concerns, national security vs. civil liberties issues, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards traditional values due to the recognition of Christmas, but this is very minor.",
