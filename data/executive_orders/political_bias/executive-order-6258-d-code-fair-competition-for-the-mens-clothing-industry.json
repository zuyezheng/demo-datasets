    "critique": "This document pertains to the National Industrial Recovery Act, which is a New Deal program. This suggests a liberal ideological tilt due to government intervention in the economy. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The document focuses on economic regulation through a 'Code of Fair Competition,' indicating government intervention. Therefore, the economic regulation score should be positive. Given the lack of information on the other axes, they should be scored as neutral.",
