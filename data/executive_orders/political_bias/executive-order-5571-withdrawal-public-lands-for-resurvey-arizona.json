    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order from 1931. It's difficult to assess its ideological tilt without more context, but given the time period, a moderate approach seems appropriate. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is somewhat expanded as the order remains in effect unless revoked by the President or Congress. Federalism is strengthened as the order withdraws land from settlement pending a resurvey. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly addressed. Economic regulation is not directly addressed. Social inclusion is not directly addressed.",
