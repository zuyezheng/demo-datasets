    "critique": "This executive order establishes the order of succession for the Attorney General position. It is a routine administrative action that ensures the continuity of leadership within the Department of Justice. There is no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or economic regulation. The order does not expand executive power, as it simply clarifies the line of succession. It also does not directly impact federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are all neutral.",
