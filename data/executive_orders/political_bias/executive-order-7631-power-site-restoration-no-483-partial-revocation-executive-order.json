    "critique": "This document revokes a power-site reserve on certain lands. This seems to have no ideological tilt, immigration implications, impact on executive power, or bearing on national security vs. civil liberties. It also doesn't seem to directly regulate the economy or promote social inclusion/conformity. It could be argued that revoking the reserve slightly favors state control, but it's a very weak effect. Therefore, all scores are 0.",
