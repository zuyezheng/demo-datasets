    "critique": "This executive order returns the Coast Guard to the Department of Treasury after its temporary assignment to the Navy during World War II. It seems primarily administrative in nature, dealing with the transfer of authority, personnel, and resources. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on social inclusion. The order does shift some power between departments (Navy to Treasury), but this appears to be a temporary wartime measure being reversed, so it doesn't strongly affect federalism in the long term. The order also doesn't seem to significantly expand executive power, as it's largely about unwinding a previous order. It has a neutral impact on national security vs. civil liberties and economic regulation. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
