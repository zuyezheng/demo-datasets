    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1936 exempting a specific person from mandatory retirement. It is a very specific action, and doesn't have broad implications. Ideological Tilt: This is hard to judge. It doesn't really lean liberal or conservative. Immigration Approach: Not relevant. Executive Power: It uses executive power to make an exception, but it's a power granted by law. Federalism: Not relevant. National Security vs. Civil Liberties: Not relevant. Economic Regulation: Not relevant. Social Inclusion: Not relevant.",
