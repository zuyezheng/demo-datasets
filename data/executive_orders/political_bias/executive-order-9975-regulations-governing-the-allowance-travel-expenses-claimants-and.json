It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards social inclusion, as it provides benefits to veterans, but this is a stretch.",
