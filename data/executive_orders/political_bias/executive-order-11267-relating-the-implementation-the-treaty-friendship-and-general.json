    "critique": "This document designates the Attorney General as the \"competent national authority\" to fulfill obligations under a treaty with Spain. It's primarily administrative, ensuring the treaty's provisions are met. There's no clear ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It doesn't expand executive power significantly, as it's implementing an existing treaty. It doesn't directly affect federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
