    "critique": "The document emphasizes transparency, fairness, and adherence to due process in administrative enforcement and adjudication. It aims to limit agency overreach and ensure regulated parties have notice and opportunity to contest agency actions. It promotes cooperation and information sharing with the private sector. The document seems to favor deregulation by limiting the use of guidance documents to impose new standards and emphasizes compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act.",
