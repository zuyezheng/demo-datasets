    "critique": "This document pertains to the withdrawal of public lands in Nevada from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. It cites specific acts of Congress as its authority. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is neutral as it simply concerns land management. Therefore, most axes should be scored as 0.",
