    "critique": "The document focuses on delegating functions related to economic stabilization and defense mobilization, indicating a moderate level of government intervention in the economy. It doesn't directly address social issues, immigration, or civil liberties, so those scores are neutral. The delegation of authority suggests a balanced approach to executive power and federalism.",
