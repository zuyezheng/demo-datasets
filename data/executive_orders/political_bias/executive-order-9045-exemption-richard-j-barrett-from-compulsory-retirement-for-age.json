    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts a specific individual, Richard J. Barrett, from mandatory retirement for one year. It cites a specific law as its authority. There is very little here to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It does not touch on immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that seems relevant is executive power. Because it is a specific exemption, it is hard to say whether it expands executive power in general. It could be argued that it does because it is an exception to a rule, but it is also limited in scope.",
