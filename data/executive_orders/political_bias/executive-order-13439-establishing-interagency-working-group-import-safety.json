    "critique": "The document establishes an interagency working group to promote the safety of imported products. It involves multiple government departments and agencies, focusing on reviewing procedures, identifying best practices, and enhancing coordination. There is a slight expansion of executive power through the establishment of the working group and the direction given to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The document does not explicitly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It leans towards economic regulation by aiming to ensure the safety of imported products.",
