    "critique": "This executive order establishes an interagency working group to promote the safety of imported products. It involves multiple government departments and agencies to review and assess current procedures and methods aimed at ensuring the safety of products exported to the United States. It aims to identify actions and appropriate steps that can be pursued within existing resources. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism shift, national security vs. civil liberties concern, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
