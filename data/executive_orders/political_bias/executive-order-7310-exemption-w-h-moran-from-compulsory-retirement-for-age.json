    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1936 exempting W. H. Moran, Chief of the Secret Service Division, from mandatory retirement. It's a fairly specific action related to a single individual. There's not much ideological content here. It doesn't touch on immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any meaningful way. The only axis that is relevant is executive power, and it slightly expands it, as it uses the President's power to make an exception to a rule. However, the rule itself allows for such exceptions, so the expansion is minimal.",
