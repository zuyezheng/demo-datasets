    "critique": "This document pertains to land management and resource allocation, specifically the withdrawal of public lands in California from settlement, location, sale, or entry pending a resurvey. It does not directly address typical political issues such as immigration, executive power, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The federalism aspect leans slightly towards federal control as it involves a federal order impacting state lands.",
