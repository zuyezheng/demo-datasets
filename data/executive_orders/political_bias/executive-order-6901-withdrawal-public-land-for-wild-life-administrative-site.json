    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that reserves a tract of public land in Alaska for the joint use of the Department of Agriculture and the Alaska Game Commission. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt as it mainly concerns land management. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores will be neutral.",
