    "critique": "This executive order changes the name of an advisory commission and extends its life by two years. It seems to promote social inclusion by focusing on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. There's no indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power changes, federalism implications, national security concerns, or economic regulation. Therefore, most axes should be neutral, with a slight positive score for social inclusion.",
