    "critique": "The document authorizes the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation to order to active duty units and individual members not assigned to units, of the Selected Reserve. This seems to expand executive power. The order pertains to augmenting the active armed forces of the United States for the effective conduct of operational missions in and around the Arabian Peninsula, which suggests a focus on national security. There is no mention of immigration, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion, so these should be neutral. The document does not explicitly promote a liberal or conservative agenda, so it should be neutral.",
