    "critique": "The document is about appointing Mrs. Marjorie M. Noone to a position in the Treasury Department without regard to civil service rules. This is justified by the fact that she is the widow of a former Treasury Department employee who committed suicide due to financial burdens and ill health, leaving her and her three daughters without means of support. The order is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury.",
