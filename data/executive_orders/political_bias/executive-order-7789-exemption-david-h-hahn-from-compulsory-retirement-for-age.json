    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1938 exempting a specific person from mandatory retirement. It's a fairly narrow action. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on the modern left-right spectrum. It doesn't directly relate to immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that seems relevant is executive power, and even there, it's a limited use of existing authority granted by Congress. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
