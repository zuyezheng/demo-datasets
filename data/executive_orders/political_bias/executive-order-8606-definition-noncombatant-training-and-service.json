    "critique": "The document outlines noncombatant service for conscientious objectors. It balances military needs with individual religious beliefs. The order doesn't expand executive power significantly, but clarifies existing law. It doesn't directly address immigration, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It leans slightly towards protecting civil liberties by accommodating religious objections to war.",
