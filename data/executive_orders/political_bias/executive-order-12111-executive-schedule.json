    "critique": "This document is an executive order that adjusts the placement of certain positions within the Executive Schedule. It moves the position of Counselor on Labor Management Relations, Department of Commerce to level IV and removes 'Assistant to the Secretary and Land Utilization Adviser, Department of the Interior' from Section 1-102(g). This seems like a routine administrative action with minimal impact on the axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
