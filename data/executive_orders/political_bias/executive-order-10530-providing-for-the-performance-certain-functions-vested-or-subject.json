    "critique": "This document delegates presidential authority to various agencies and individuals. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The delegation of authority could be seen as slightly restraining executive power, but it's primarily an administrative matter.",
