    "critique": "This document concerns the revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in Wyoming and their subsequent opening to entry under public-land laws, prioritizing qualified ex-service men for a period of 91 days. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any significant way. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The prioritization of ex-service men could be seen as a slight nod towards traditional values, but it's not strong enough to warrant a significant score.",
