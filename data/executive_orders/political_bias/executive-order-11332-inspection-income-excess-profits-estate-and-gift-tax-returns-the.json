    "critique": "This document is an executive order that allows the House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations to inspect tax returns from 1947 to 1968. It is related to government oversight and efficiency. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power expansion, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order itself doesn't expand executive power, but it does grant access to information, which could be seen as a slight increase in federal power.",
