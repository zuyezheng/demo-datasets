    "critique": "This executive order focuses on improving the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). It emphasizes transparency, efficiency, and citizen-centered service in government agencies' handling of FOIA requests. There's no indication of a specific ideological tilt, as it aims to make government information more accessible, which could be seen as a good governance principle across the political spectrum. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a way that expands it, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
