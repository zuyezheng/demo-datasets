    "critique": "This document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in Colorado pending a resurvey. It's a very specific and technical action. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt, immigration stance, impact on executive power, or bearing on national security vs. civil liberties. It seems to have a very slight impact on federalism and economic regulation, and no impact on social inclusion. It is hard to say whether the resurvey promotes economic regulation or deregulation. I will assume it is neutral. The revocation of the order could be seen as returning control to the state, but it is hard to say without more context. I will assume it is neutral.",
