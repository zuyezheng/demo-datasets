It does not contain explicit content related to ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the initial scores should be neutral. The extension itself doesn't inherently expand executive power, so that should also be neutral.",
