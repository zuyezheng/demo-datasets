    "critique": "This document outlines the physical standards and procedures for the Selective Service System during World War II. It details the process of examining registrants, classifying them based on their physical fitness, and handling appeals. There is no discussion of immigration, so that axis should be neutral. The document does not seem to expand executive power, but rather implements a law passed by Congress. It also doesn't seem to favor states or the federal government, so that axis should be neutral as well. The document prioritizes national security by ensuring a fit military force, but also includes provisions for conscientious objectors, so it is somewhat balanced. The document does not seem to have any economic regulation or social inclusion aspects, so those axes should be neutral.",
