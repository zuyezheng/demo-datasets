    "critique": "This document is an executive order adjusting the rates of monthly basic pay, basic allowances for subsistence, and basic allowances for quarters for members of the uniformed services. It also adjusts the rate of monthly cadet or midshipman pay. It is effective on January 1, 1996, and supersedes a section of a previous executive order. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism concerns, national security vs. civil liberties issues, economic regulation implications, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
