    "critique": "The document is a designation of Ronald Ransom as Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. It does not touch upon ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power, but it is a routine appointment.",
