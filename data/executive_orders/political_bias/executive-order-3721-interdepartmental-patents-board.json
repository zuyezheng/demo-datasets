    "critique": "This executive order establishes an Interdepartmental Patents Board to handle inventions and patents evolved by government employees. It seems primarily focused on internal government operations and efficiency. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. The order centralizes authority regarding patents within the federal government, suggesting a slight shift towards federal primacy. There's no indication of economic regulation or social inclusion policies. Therefore, most axes should be scored neutrally, with a slight lean towards federal control.",
