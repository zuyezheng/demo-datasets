    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order from 1933, signed by the President. It withdraws public lands in Colorado from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. This seems to be a fairly routine administrative action. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly relate to immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on federalism as it is a federal action concerning federal lands, but it's not a major shift. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
