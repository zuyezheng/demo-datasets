    "critique": "The document expands executive power by granting the Attorney General broad discretion over parole decisions for those convicted under the Selective Training and Service Act. It also centralizes control at the federal level, dictating terms of parole and service. There is a focus on national security and the enforcement of the draft, potentially limiting individual liberties. The document does not directly address economic regulation, immigration, or social inclusion.",
