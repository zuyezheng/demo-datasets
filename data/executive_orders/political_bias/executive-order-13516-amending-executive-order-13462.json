    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous order (13462) regarding the President's Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB) and the Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB). It modifies the composition of the PIAB, clarifies the roles of the Chair, and addresses information sharing and protection. There's nothing inherently ideological in these changes. The order seems to be about refining the structure and function of intelligence oversight, not about pushing a particular political agenda. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The changes don't seem to expand executive power significantly, nor do they obviously impact federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order does not address immigration.",
