    "critique": "This executive order establishes a temporary organization within the Department of State to facilitate a strategic partnership between the U.S. Government and the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan. It focuses on security, stabilization, and transitioning to a normalized diplomatic presence. There is nothing explicitly liberal or conservative about this. It does not address immigration. It could be argued that establishing an office expands executive power, but it is temporary and within existing departmental structures. It centralizes control within the Department of State, thus federal control. It does not obviously prioritize national security over civil liberties or vice versa. It does not directly regulate the economy. It does not obviously promote or hinder social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
