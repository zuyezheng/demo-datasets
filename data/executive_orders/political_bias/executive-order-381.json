    "critique": "The order prioritizes federal control over property seized during the rebellion and uses it to support freedmen, indicating a strong federal role and emphasis on social inclusion. The directive doesn't directly address economic regulation, executive power, security vs. liberty, or immigration, so those aspects are scored as neutral. The ideological tilt leans liberal due to the focus on supporting freedmen.",
