    "critique": "This document is a short note about reinstating the widow of a former Immigration Service employee to a position in the Department of Labor. It is difficult to assess its political bias along the given axes due to the limited information. It seems to be a specific case rather than a policy statement. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral (0). There's a slight lean towards social inclusion as it helps a widow, but it's very minimal.",
