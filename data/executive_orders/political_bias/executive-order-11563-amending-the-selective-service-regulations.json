    "critique": "This document pertains to the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 and outlines amendments to the Selective Service Regulations. It details the procedures for local boards to select and order men for induction into the armed forces. The document prioritizes volunteers and those in specific age groups and selection groups. It also addresses procedures for those who have refused physical examinations or have been granted postponements. It does not directly address immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document expands executive power by giving the executive branch more control over the draft. It centralizes power at the federal level. It prioritizes national security. It is difficult to place on the traditional left-right spectrum.",
