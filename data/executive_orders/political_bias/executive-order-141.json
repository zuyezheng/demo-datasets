    "critique": "This document is an executive order related to currency exchange rates in Cuba in 1898. It appears to be a technical adjustment to the rates at which certain foreign currencies are accepted for payments. There is no immediately obvious ideological tilt, immigration component, expansion of executive power, or bearing on national security vs. civil liberties. It does not obviously relate to social inclusion. It has a moderate impact on economic regulation, as it sets specific rates. It has a moderate impact on federalism, as it is a federal action impacting Cuba.",
