    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending a previous executive order regarding classification of information. It adds agencies to the list of those with authority for original classification and removes the Subversive Activities Control Board. \n\n*   **Ideological Tilt:** 0, This is a procedural document with no clear ideological leaning.\n*   **Immigration Approach:** 0, This document has nothing to do with immigration.\n*   **Executive Power:** 0, This document makes minor changes to existing executive orders and does not substantially expand or restrict executive power.\n*   **Federalism:** 0, This document does not address the balance of power between state and federal governments.\n*   **National Security vs. Civil Liberties:** 0, The document deals with classification of information, which could have implications for both national security and civil liberties, but the changes are minor and do not clearly prioritize one over the other. The removal of the Subversive Activities Control Board could be seen as slightly favoring civil liberties, but it's not a strong enough signal to warrant a negative score.\n*   **Economic Regulation:** 0, This document has no impact on economic regulation.\n*   **Social Inclusion:** 0, This document has no impact on social inclusion.\n\nRevised Scores:\n*   Ideological Tilt: 0\n*   Immigration Approach: 0\n*   Executive Power: 0\n*   Federalism: 0\n*   National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0\n*   Economic Regulation: 0\n*   Social Inclusion: 0",
