    "critique": "This executive order establishes a Central Statistical Board to coordinate statistical services related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. It aims to improve, develop, and coordinate statistical services, promoting economy and eliminating duplication. The order grants the board authority to investigate statistical services, request information from federal agencies, and appoint employees. It also allocates funds for the board's operations. The order expands federal power and economic intervention. There is no direct impact on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is moderately liberal due to the interventionist nature of the National Industrial Recovery Act.",
