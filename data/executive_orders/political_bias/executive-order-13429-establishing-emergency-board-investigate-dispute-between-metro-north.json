    "critique": "This executive order establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between Metro-North Railroad and its employees. It is a fairly procedural action mandated by the Railway Labor Act. There is little indication of strong ideological bias, immigration policy, or impacts on civil liberties. It seems to have a neutral impact on executive power and federalism. It could be argued that it has a slight interventionist approach to economic regulation, but it is primarily aimed at resolving a labor dispute. There is no clear impact on social inclusion.",
