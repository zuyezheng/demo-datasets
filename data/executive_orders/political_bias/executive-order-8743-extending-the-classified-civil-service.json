    "critique": "This executive order expands the classified civil service, which could be seen as a moderate expansion of executive power and a move towards federal control. It also establishes a Board of Legal Examiners to promote a merit system for attorneys, which could be seen as a move towards social inclusion. However, it also includes provisions for veterans' preference, which could be seen as a move towards conformity. Overall, the order seems to be a balanced approach to civil service reform.",
