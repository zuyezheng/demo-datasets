It directs the OMB to develop criteria and standards for impact analyses, and requires executive agencies to prepare these analyses for major policy initiatives. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 0.",
