    "critique": "This document establishes the Emergency Conservation Corps and outlines the powers of the Director. It seems to be an expansion of executive power, as it authorizes the director to hire personnel without regard to civil service laws. It also seems to be an example of government intervention in the economy, as it creates a government program to provide jobs. It is difficult to assess its position on the other axes without more information. It is likely slightly liberal due to the government intervention in the economy. It is neutral on immigration, federalism, security/liberty, and social inclusion.",
