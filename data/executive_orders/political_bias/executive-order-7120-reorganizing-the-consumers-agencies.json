    "critique": "This document establishes a Consumers' Division within the National Recovery Administration, aimed at promoting consumer interests and a higher standard of living. It centralizes consumer-related functions from various existing bodies. Ideologically, it leans liberal due to its interventionist approach in the economy and focus on improving living standards. Immigration is not addressed, so it's neutral. Executive power is somewhat expanded as it recreates and empowers an office and division. Federalism is strengthened as it consolidates power at the federal level. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly addressed, so it's neutral. Economic regulation is increased through the promotion of 'larger and more economical production' and review of public policy related to the consumer. Social inclusion is not directly addressed, so it's neutral.",
