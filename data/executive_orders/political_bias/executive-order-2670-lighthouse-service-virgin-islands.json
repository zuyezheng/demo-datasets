    "critique": "The document focuses on the transfer of lighthouse administration from the former government of the Virgin Islands to the US government. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral. The federalism aspect leans slightly towards federal control as it centralizes the lighthouse service under the US Secretary of Commerce.",
