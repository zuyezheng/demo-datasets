    "critique": "This executive order concerns the administration of clothing allowances for enlisted men in the armed forces. It delegates authority to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Treasury to manage these allowances, ensuring some consistency between the Navy/Naval Reserve and the Coast Guard/Coast Guard Reserve. There's nothing inherently ideological about this; it's a matter of administrative procedure. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
