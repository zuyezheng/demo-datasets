    "critique": "The document establishes a reservation for the Crow tribe of Indians, withdrawing the land from sale and settlement. This action suggests a balanced approach to federalism, as it involves a decision made at the federal level regarding land within a territory. It also touches on social inclusion by recognizing and protecting the rights and lands of a Native American tribe.",
