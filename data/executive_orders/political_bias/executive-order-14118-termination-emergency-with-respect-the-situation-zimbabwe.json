    "critique": "This executive order terminates a national emergency declaration related to Zimbabwe, initially declared in 2003 and expanded in subsequent orders. It revokes these prior executive orders but clarifies that the termination does not affect actions or proceedings already underway. The order includes standard clauses about not impairing existing authorities or creating new enforceable rights. It expresses continued concern about human rights abuses and corruption in Zimbabwe, but states the national emergency is no longer needed. Given that it terminates rather than enacts new restrictions, and includes standard legal clauses, it doesn't strongly lean in any particular direction on most axes. The action could be seen as slightly liberal in that it eases restrictions, but the overall impact is minimal. Therefore, most scores are near neutral.",
