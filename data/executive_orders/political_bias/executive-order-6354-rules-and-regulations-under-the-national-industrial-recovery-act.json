    "critique": "Let's analyze this executive order from 1933. \n\nIdeological Tilt: The document is part of the New Deal, which was a liberal response to the Great Depression. It involves government intervention in the economy, which aligns with a liberal approach. Score: +4\n\nImmigration Approach: This document does not address immigration. Score: 0\n\nExecutive Power: The document is an executive order, but it also provides exemptions and directs investigations, which could be seen as a balanced approach. Score: 0\n\nFederalism: The document expands federal power by implementing the National Industrial Recovery Act. Score: +4\n\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The document does not directly address national security or civil liberties. Score: 0\n\nEconomic Regulation: The document heavily regulates the economy through codes of fair competition and price investigations. Score: +5\n\nSocial Inclusion: The document does not directly address social inclusion, but it aims to provide relief to small businesses, which could be seen as a form of economic inclusion. Score: 0\n\nRevised Scores:\nAfter further consideration, the initial scores seem appropriate. The document clearly reflects a liberal approach to economic regulation and federal power, while remaining neutral on other axes.",
