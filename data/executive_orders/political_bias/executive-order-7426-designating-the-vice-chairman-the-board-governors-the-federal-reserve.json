    "critique": "The document is a simple appointment of a Vice Chairman to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. It doesn't touch upon any of the axes in a significant way. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The appointment itself doesn't inherently expand executive power, nor does it strongly favor federal or state control. It has no direct impact on immigration, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is also neutral, as the appointment itself doesn't reflect a specific political leaning.",
