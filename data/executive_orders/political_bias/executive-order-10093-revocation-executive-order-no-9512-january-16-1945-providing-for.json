    "critique": "This document revokes a previous executive order related to the allocation of field positions under the Classification Act of 1923. It's a simple revocation with no clear ideological leaning. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
