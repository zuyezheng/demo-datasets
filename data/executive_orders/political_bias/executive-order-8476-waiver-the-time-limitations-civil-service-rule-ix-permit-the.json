    "critique": "This document is a short executive order regarding the reinstatement of a specific individual, Mrs. Martha Overstreet, to a clerical position in the post office at Douglas, Georgia. It cites the Civil Service Act as its authority. Given the limited scope and specific nature of the order, it's difficult to assign strong biases along most of the axes. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any meaningful way. The order seems primarily administrative and compassionate, reinstating the widow of a Post Office Inspector. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
