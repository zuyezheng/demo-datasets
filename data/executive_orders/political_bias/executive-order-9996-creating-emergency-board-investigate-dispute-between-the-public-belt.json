    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a labor dispute between a railroad commission and its employees. It aims to prevent interruption of interstate commerce. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has a slight interventionist approach by creating a board to resolve the dispute.",
