    "critique": "The document is an authorization to suspend habeas corpus during an insurrection. This suggests a strong focus on national security at the expense of civil liberties. It also implies a strong executive power, as it allows for the suspension of a fundamental right. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, those axes should be scored as neutral.",
