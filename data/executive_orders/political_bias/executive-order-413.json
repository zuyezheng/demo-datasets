    "critique": "The document centralizes power in the federal government by authorizing the governor of Missouri to raise a state militia to cooperate with US troops, armed, equipped, and paid by the US. It emphasizes security by suppressing rebellion. It also reflects a balance between state and federal control, as the militia is for the defense of Missouri but operates under US Army regulations.",
