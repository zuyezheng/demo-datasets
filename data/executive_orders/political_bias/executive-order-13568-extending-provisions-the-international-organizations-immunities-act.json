    "critique": "The document extends privileges, exemptions, and immunities to international organizations. This suggests a cooperative stance towards international bodies. There's no clear indication of a left-right ideological leaning. The document doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The extension of immunities could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power in foreign affairs, but it's indirect.",
