    "critique": "This document revokes two executive orders related to the Federal Field Committee for Development Planning in Alaska and abolishes the committee. It directs the Secretary of Commerce to handle the termination arrangements. Given the limited scope and focus on administrative restructuring, the document has minimal implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are near neutral.",
