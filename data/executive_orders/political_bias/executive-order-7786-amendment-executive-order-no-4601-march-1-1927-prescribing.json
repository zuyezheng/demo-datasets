    "critique": "This document pertains to the award of the Distinguished Flying Cross and delegates authority to the Secretaries of War, Navy, and Treasury to make the award and promulgate regulations. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It has a slight impact on federalism by delegating authority to department secretaries, and a very slight impact on executive power by delegating authority away from the president directly. There is no impact on economic regulation or social inclusion.",
