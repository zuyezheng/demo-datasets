    "critique": "This executive order establishes the National Medal of Science and the President's Committee on the National Medal of Science. It outlines the criteria for awarding the medal, the composition of the committee, and the procedures for recommendations and awards. There is a slight tilt towards social inclusion by including immigrants who have filed for naturalization. The order itself doesn't directly address economic regulation, executive power, federalism, or national security vs. civil liberties. Therefore, most axes will be neutral.",
