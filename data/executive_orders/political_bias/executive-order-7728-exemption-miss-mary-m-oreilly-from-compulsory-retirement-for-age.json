    "critique": "This is an executive order that makes an exception to a rule about mandatory retirement for government employees. It extends the service of one particular employee, Miss Mary M. O'Reilly. There is nothing inherently liberal or conservative about this. It does give the executive branch more power, but only very slightly. It doesn't touch on immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral.",
