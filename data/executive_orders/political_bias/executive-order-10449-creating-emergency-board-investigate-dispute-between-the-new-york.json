    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between a railroad company and its employees. It aims to prevent interruption of interstate commerce. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power grab, or federalism implications. It seems to balance the interests of the company and employees, with a focus on maintaining essential transportation services. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The economic regulation aspect is slightly interventionist, but not heavily so.",
