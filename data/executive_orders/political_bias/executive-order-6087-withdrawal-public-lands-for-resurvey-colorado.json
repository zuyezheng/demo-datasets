    "critique": "This document is a withdrawal of public lands in Colorado from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation, pending a resurvey. It cites the act of June 25, 1910, as amended, and is subject to the conditions, provisions, and limitations of said acts. This seems to be a fairly routine administrative action related to land management. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The withdrawal of land could be seen as a very slight intervention, so I will give a +1 for economic regulation. The order being signed by the president could be seen as a very slight expansion of executive power, so I will give a +1 for executive power.",
