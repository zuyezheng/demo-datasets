    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the establishment and expansion of a wildlife refuge. It doesn't directly address typical left-right political issues, immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federal government is taking control of land, which indicates a slight increase in federal power.",
