It adds the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO and District Lodge 94 and Local Lodge 1484 thereof to the first paragraph and deletes the name \"Morris L. Myers\" from the third paragraph. These changes do not seem to have any significant impact on the axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
