    "critique": "This document is a simple delegation of authority, allowing the Solicitor of Labor to perform the duties of Secretary of Labor in their absence. It doesn't touch on any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis it slightly touches is executive power, but only in a technical, administrative sense, not in a way that expands the executive's authority in a controversial or politically charged way. Therefore, all axes should be scored as neutral.",
