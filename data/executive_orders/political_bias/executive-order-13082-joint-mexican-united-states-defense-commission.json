    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the composition of the Joint-Mexican-United States Defense Commission. It adds a member of the Joint Staff to the US membership of the commission. This change does not directly impact ideological tilt, immigration, economic regulation, social inclusion, security vs. liberty, or federalism. The only axis that is potentially affected is executive power, but the change is minor and administrative in nature. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
