    "critique": "This document approves a code of fair competition for the Packaging Machinery Industry and Trade under the National Industrial Recovery Act. This act is a clear example of government intervention in the economy. There is no information related to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. The document seems to expand executive power, but this is part of the original act. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the interventionist nature of the act.",
