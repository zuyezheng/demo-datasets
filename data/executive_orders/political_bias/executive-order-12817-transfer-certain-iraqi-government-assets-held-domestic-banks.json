    "critique": "This executive order, issued by George Bush in 1992, deals with the blocking and transfer of Iraqi assets held in US financial institutions to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in order to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 778 following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. It's a fairly technical order focused on implementing international sanctions and doesn't directly address many of the axes. It does expand executive power somewhat in directing financial institutions and the Federal Reserve. It also centralizes control at the federal level. There is a national security component related to enforcing sanctions. It doesn't directly relate to immigration, economic regulation in a broad sense, or social inclusion. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on a left-right spectrum, as it's primarily about foreign policy and national security.",
