    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding airspace reservations in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska. It terminates a previous airspace reservation and revokes a prior executive order. Given the subject matter, the document has very little bearing on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
