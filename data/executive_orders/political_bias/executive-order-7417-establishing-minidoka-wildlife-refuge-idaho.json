    "critique": "This document establishes the Minidoka Wildlife Refuge in Idaho. It withdraws lands from settlement and appropriation to be used by the Department of Agriculture for a refuge and breeding ground for birds and other wildlife. The order also addresses land previously withdrawn for reclamation purposes related to the Minidoka Irrigation Project, clarifying that the wildlife refuge is subject to the Department of Interior's use for irrigation. It supersedes a previous temporary withdrawal and revokes earlier executive orders related to the Minidoka Bird Reservation.",
