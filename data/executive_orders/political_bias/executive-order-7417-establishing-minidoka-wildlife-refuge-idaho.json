    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Minidoka Wildlife Refuge. It withdraws land from settlement and reserves it for the Department of Agriculture to use as a refuge and breeding ground for birds and other wildlife. The order also addresses existing rights and previous withdrawals related to the Minidoka Irrigation Project. It revokes previous executive orders related to the Minidoka Bird Reservation. This action seems to have minimal impact on the axes. The order itself does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal, as it supports environmental conservation.",
