    "critique": "The document establishes the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. It seems to expand executive power slightly by creating a board to advise the President on intelligence matters. It also centralizes control over foreign intelligence at the federal level. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document seems to prioritize national security.",
