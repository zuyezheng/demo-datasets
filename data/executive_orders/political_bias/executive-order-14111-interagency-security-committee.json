    "critique": "This executive order establishes an Interagency Security Committee to enhance the security and protection of federal facilities. It mandates cooperation among various federal departments and agencies, setting policies and standards for security, and monitoring compliance. The order does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It centralizes authority by creating a federal committee, potentially expanding executive power through increased oversight and standardization of security measures. It also leans towards prioritizing national security by focusing on protecting federal facilities. There is no mention of social inclusion or diversity. Therefore, the initial scores reflect these observations.",
