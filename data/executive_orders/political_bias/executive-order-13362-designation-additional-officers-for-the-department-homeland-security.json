    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the line of succession within the Department of Homeland Security. It specifies the order in which regional directors of FEMA will assume the role of acting Secretary of Homeland Security if the primary and deputy secretaries are unable to perform their duties. The order also clarifies that individuals serving in an acting capacity within those FEMA positions are not eligible to act as Secretary under this order, and that the President retains the discretion to depart from this order. This seems like a fairly procedural document. There's nothing inherently ideological about establishing a line of succession. It doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that by ensuring a clear line of succession, the order strengthens the executive branch's ability to respond to emergencies, but it doesn't dramatically expand executive power. It also doesn't obviously shift power between the federal government and the states. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
