    "critique": "This document designates several international organizations as public international organizations, granting them certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. It does not obviously lean left or right (ideological tilt). It does not directly address immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power insofar as it is an executive order, but the act it invokes was approved by congress. It does not obviously favor state or federal primacy. It does not obviously impact national security or civil liberties. It does not obviously regulate the economy. It could be argued that it promotes social inclusion by engaging with international organizations.",
