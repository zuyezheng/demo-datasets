    "critique": "This document is a presidential order to close government offices for Memorial Day. It is a simple act of honoring soldiers and sailors who died in the Civil War. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism concerns, national security vs. civil liberties issues, economic regulation, or social inclusion/conformity aspects. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
