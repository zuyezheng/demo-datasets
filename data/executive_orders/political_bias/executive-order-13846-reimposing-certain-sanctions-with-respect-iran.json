    "critique": "This executive order reimposes sanctions on Iran after the US withdrawal from the JCPOA. It targets Iran's energy, shipping, and financial sectors, as well as individuals and entities involved in human rights abuses and censorship. It also aims to prevent the diversion of goods intended for the Iranian people. The order expands executive power by authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury and other officials to impose sanctions on individuals and entities that engage in certain activities related to Iran. It prioritizes national security by restricting Iran's access to resources that could be used to develop weapons or support terrorism. It reflects a conservative foreign policy approach by taking a hard line on Iran and seeking to isolate the country economically. There is no direct impact on immigration, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion within the US. Therefore, the scores for these axes are neutral.",
