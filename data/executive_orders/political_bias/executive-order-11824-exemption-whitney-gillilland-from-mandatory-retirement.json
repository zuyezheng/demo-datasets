    "critique": "This executive order is a very specific and narrow action, exempting one individual from mandatory retirement. It doesn't touch on broad ideological themes, immigration, or economic regulation. It has a slight impact on executive power, as it uses existing authority to make an exception, but it's not a major expansion. It doesn't directly affect federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards expanding executive power.",
