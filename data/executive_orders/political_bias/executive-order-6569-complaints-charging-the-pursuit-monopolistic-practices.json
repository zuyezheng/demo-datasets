    "critique": "This document is an executive order from Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934, related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. It directs that complaints regarding monopolistic practices under the NIRA be transferred to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) if the complainant is dissatisfied with the initial agency's disposition, excluding the Department of Justice. The FTC can then institute proceedings or, if the practice isn't contrary to specific acts, transfer the complaint to the Department of Justice. The order clarifies that it doesn't diminish the FTC's existing powers. The document seems to favor government intervention in the economy to prevent monopolies and protect small enterprises, aligning with a liberal approach to economic regulation at the time. There is no direct impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes should be neutral.",
