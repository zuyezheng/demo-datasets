    "critique": "This executive order simply amends the order of succession within the Department of Agriculture. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that might be relevant is executive power and federalism. However, since this is a routine administrative matter, it does not expand executive power in any meaningful way, nor does it shift power between the federal government and the states. Therefore, all axes should be scored as neutral.",
