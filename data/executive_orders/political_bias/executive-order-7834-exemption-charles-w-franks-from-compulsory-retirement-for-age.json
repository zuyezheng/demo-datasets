    "critique": "This is an executive order that makes an exception to a rule about retirement age for a government employee. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion based on this document. The only axis that seems relevant is executive power. The document expands executive power because it allows the president to make exceptions to existing rules. Therefore, the initial score for executive power is +3.",
