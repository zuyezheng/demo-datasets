    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 that establishes a naval reservation in the Canal Zone. It primarily deals with land allocation and jurisdictional control. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. The order delegates control to the Secretary of the Navy but retains civil jurisdiction for Canal Zone authorities, indicating a balance between federal and local control. There's no indication of economic regulation or social inclusion policies. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
