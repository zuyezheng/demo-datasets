    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the administrative function of assembling a Coast Guard Personnel Board. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The order itself doesn't expand executive power; it merely directs the Secretary of the Treasury to perform a routine task.",
