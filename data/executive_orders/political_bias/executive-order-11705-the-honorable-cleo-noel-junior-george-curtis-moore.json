    "critique": "This document is a proclamation ordering the flag of the United States to be flown at half-staff in memory of two US diplomats murdered in the line of duty. It is a symbolic gesture of respect and mourning. There is no direct indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, executive power expansion, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The act of issuing a proclamation might be construed as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's a standard function, so I will keep it neutral.",
