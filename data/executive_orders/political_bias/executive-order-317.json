    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the management of the participation of several Executive Departments, the Department of Agriculture, and the Smithsonian Institution in the Cincinnati Industrial Exposition and the Southern Exposition. It extends the provisions of a previous order related to the World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition to these new expositions. The document itself doesn't express strong opinions on the axes, but it does imply a degree of federal involvement in these expositions.",
