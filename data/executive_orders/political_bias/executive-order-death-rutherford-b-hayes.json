    "critique": "This document is a proclamation regarding the death of a former president. It expresses sorrow and orders mourning procedures. There is little to no indication of political bias across the defined axes. The mention of 'free institutions' and 'patriotic citizen' are generic and don't strongly indicate a leaning. The reference to a 'happy Christian home' could be interpreted as leaning towards traditional values, but it's primarily descriptive. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
