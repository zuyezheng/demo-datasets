    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between Northwest Airlines and its employees. It does not seem to obviously lean left or right (Ideological Tilt). It does not deal with immigration (Immigration Approach). It could be argued that it expands executive power, but it is also a fairly standard action (Executive Power). It does not seem to obviously favor the states or the federal government (Federalism). It does not seem to obviously favor national security or civil liberties (National Security vs. Civil Liberties). It could be argued that it intervenes in the economy, but it is also a fairly standard action (Economic Regulation). It does not seem to obviously favor conformity or diversity (Social Inclusion).",
