    "critique": "This document is an executive order that allows Watson B. Miller to be appointed to the position of Assistant Administrator of the Federal Security Agency without compliance with the competitive provisions of the Civil Service Act and Rules. This could be seen as an expansion of executive power, as it allows the president to bypass the normal hiring process. However, it also requires that Miller establish requisite qualifications for the position before the Civil Service Commission, which could be seen as a check on this power. The order is recommended by the [NAME], which suggests that it is not a unilateral decision. The document does not seem to have any strong ideological tilt, immigration implications, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties implications, economic regulation implications, or social inclusion implications.",
