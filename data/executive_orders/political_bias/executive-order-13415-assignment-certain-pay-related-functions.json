    "critique": "This document is an executive order that assigns functions and revokes sections of previous executive orders. It appears to deal with personnel management within the government. There is nothing explicitly ideological in the document. It does not seem to touch on immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
