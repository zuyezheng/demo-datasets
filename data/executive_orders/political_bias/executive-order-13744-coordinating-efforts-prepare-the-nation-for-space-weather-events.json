    "critique": "This executive order focuses on preparing the nation for space weather events. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of various federal agencies in predicting, detecting, mitigating, and responding to these events. There's no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or any specific stance on social inclusion. It seems to be a purely pragmatic approach to a potential national security issue. The order does not seem to expand executive power significantly, but rather coordinates existing agencies and directs them to develop plans and protocols. It also doesn't seem to strongly favor either federal or state control, but rather emphasizes cooperation across different levels of government. The order balances national security with civil liberties by focusing on preparedness and mitigation rather than surveillance or restriction of freedoms. It also doesn't seem to promote economic regulation or deregulation, but rather focuses on protecting critical infrastructure. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
