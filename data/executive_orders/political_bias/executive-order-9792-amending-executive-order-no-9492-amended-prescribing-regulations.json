    "critique": "This document is a short executive order amending a previous executive order regarding non-military transportation on Army and Navy air transports. It changes the wording from \"to years\" to \"tow and one-half years\" in section 2(c). This seems to be a minor technical correction. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
