    "critique": "This document pertains to the composition of a board with members from various government agencies. It modifies a previous executive order to include the Director of the Foreign Operations Administration, the Director of Central Intelligence, the Director of the United States Information Agency, and representatives of the President as members. It also allows the Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to attend meetings. There is nothing explicitly ideological in this document. It seems to be an administrative adjustment. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's a slight increase in executive power due to presidential representatives being added to the board.",
