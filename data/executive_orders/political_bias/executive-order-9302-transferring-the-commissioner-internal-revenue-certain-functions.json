    "critique": "This document is an executive order transferring certain functions related to Internal Revenue taxes and penalties arising from violations of the National Prohibition Act from the Department of Justice to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. It seems to be an administrative matter related to the First War Powers Act. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, or social inclusion. It does not obviously expand executive power, as it is a transfer of functions rather than a creation of new powers. It does not directly address federalism or national security vs. civil liberties. It could be argued that transferring tax-related functions to the IRS is a form of economic intervention, but it is not a strong one. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
