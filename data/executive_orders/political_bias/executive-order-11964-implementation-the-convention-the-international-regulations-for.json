It delegates authority to the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to determine compliance, issue certifications and exemptions, and promulgate special rules and regulations. The order itself does not express a strong ideological stance, but rather focuses on practical implementation and adherence to international maritime regulations.",
