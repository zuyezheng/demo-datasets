    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the implementation of international regulations for preventing collisions at sea. It delegates authority to the Secretaries of the Navy and the Department in which the Coast Guard operates to certify vessels, issue special rules, and grant exemptions in accordance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or impacts on civil liberties. The document does not significantly expand executive power, as it is implementing an existing international agreement. It has a slight impact on federalism, as it centralizes authority in the federal government to implement international regulations. There is no direct impact on economic regulation or social inclusion.",
