    "critique": "This document extends privileges, exemptions, and immunities to the European Central Bank. This seems to have little to do with ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has some bearing on economic regulation, as it facilitates international cooperation with a major financial institution. I will score it as slightly deregulatory, as it reduces barriers to international financial cooperation.",
