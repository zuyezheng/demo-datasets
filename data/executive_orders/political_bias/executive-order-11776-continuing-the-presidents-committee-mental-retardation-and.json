    "critique": "This executive order focuses on mental retardation and establishes a committee to advise the President and coordinate efforts across various government agencies. It aims to improve the lives of individuals with mental retardation and integrate them into society. There is no direct impact on immigration, and it doesn't explicitly expand executive power. It involves multiple federal agencies, suggesting a cooperative approach rather than a top-down federal mandate. It emphasizes social inclusion and support for a vulnerable population. It doesn't directly address economic regulation or national security vs. civil liberties. The ideological tilt is moderately liberal, given the focus on social welfare and inclusion.",
