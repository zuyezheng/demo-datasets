    "critique": "This executive order primarily concerns the organization and function of the National Research Council (NRC) and its relationship with the federal government. It updates a previous executive order to reflect the NRC's current role and responsibilities. The order encourages cooperation between government scientists and the NRC, facilitates funding for NRC research, and allows for non-competitive acquisition of NRC services under specific circumstances. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. The order does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that would warrant extreme scores. The order seems to promote a balanced approach to research and development, with government and non-government entities working together. Therefore, most scores should be close to neutral.",
