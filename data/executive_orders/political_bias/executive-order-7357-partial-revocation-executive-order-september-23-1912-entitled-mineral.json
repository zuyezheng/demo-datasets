    "critique": "This document concerns the revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal in Arizona, with the purpose of permitting title to vest in the State of Arizona. It references several acts of Congress. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt. It seems to favor state control over federal, and doesn't touch on civil liberties, national security, immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral, except for federalism.",
