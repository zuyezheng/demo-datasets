    "critique": "This document pertains to labor relations within the Foreign Service and amends previous executive orders to include a representative of the Federal Labor Relations Authority in decision-making. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation in general, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The change seems to slightly increase the power/reach of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, which could be interpreted as a very slight shift towards government intervention in labor matters.",
