    "critique": "This document, an executive order from 1917, grants department heads the power to remove employees deemed detrimental to public welfare due to conduct, sympathies, utterances, or war-related reasons. It prioritizes national security during wartime. Ideologically, it leans conservative due to its emphasis on national unity and security over individual liberties. Immigration is not directly addressed, so it's neutral. It expands executive power by granting broad removal authority to department heads. Federalism is neutral as it doesn't significantly shift power between state and federal entities. It heavily favors national security over civil liberties. Economic regulation is not addressed. It leans towards conformity by prioritizing national unity during wartime.",
