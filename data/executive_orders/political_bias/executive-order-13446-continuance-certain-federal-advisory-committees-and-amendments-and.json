It doesn't drastically alter existing policies or create new ones with significant ideological implications. The amendment regarding the President's Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities expands its responsibilities, which can be seen as a slightly liberal move towards social inclusion. However, the order itself is largely administrative.",
