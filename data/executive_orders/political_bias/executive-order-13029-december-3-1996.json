    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the extension of privileges and immunities to personnel and institutions associated with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). It does not directly address typical ideological divides, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document's focus on international cooperation might suggest a slight lean towards liberal internationalism, but this is a minor consideration.",
