    "critique": "This document is an executive order that extends the port limits of Boston to include Braintree, Weymouth, and Hingham. This seems to be a fairly routine administrative action. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism concerns, national security vs. civil liberties issues, economic regulation implications, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
