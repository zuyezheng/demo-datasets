    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1938 exempting a specific individual from mandatory retirement. It's a fairly narrow action. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on the modern left-right spectrum. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in general, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any significant way. The only axis that it touches on is executive power, and even then, it's a very limited use of it. It's an exemption allowed by existing law, not a broad expansion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
