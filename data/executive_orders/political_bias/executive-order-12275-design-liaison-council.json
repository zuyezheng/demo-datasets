    "critique": "This executive order establishes an interagency Design Liaison Council to encourage good design within the Federal Government. It aims to ensure that federal spending on design enriches the quality of American life. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order seems relatively neutral in these areas, focusing on aesthetic and functional design within government projects.",
