    "critique": "This is an executive order from Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II, authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to take possession and operate a shipyard that was failing to meet its contractual obligations for constructing and repairing vessels. Given the context of wartime, several factors influence the scoring. Ideological Tilt: Given that this was during the new deal era, and this is an intervention in private industry, a slightly liberal tilt is appropriate. Immigration Approach: The document does not address immigration. Executive Power: The document expands executive power, but in the context of war. Federalism: The document expands federal control. National Security vs. Civil Liberties: The document prioritizes national security. Economic Regulation: The document involves heavy government intervention in the economy. Social Inclusion: The document does not address social inclusion.",
