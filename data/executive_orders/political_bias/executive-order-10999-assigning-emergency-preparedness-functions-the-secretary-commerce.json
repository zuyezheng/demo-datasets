    "critique": "This executive order from 1962 outlines the responsibilities of the Secretary of Commerce in preparing for national emergencies. It focuses on centralized control of transportation, production, and distribution of resources. Given the context of the Cold War, the order leans towards strengthening federal control and prioritizing national security. There's an emphasis on economic regulation and control to ensure resource allocation during emergencies. The order doesn't directly address immigration or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores reflect this focus on national security, federal control, and economic regulation within the historical context.",
