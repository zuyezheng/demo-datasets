    "critique": "This executive order primarily extends the operation of existing advisory committees. It touches on a variety of areas, from arts and humanities to national security and tribal colleges. There's a minor amendment to an existing order related to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, changing the co-chair structure. Overall, the order seems largely administrative and doesn't make significant changes to policy. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral.",
