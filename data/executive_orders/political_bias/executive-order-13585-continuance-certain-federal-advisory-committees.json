    "critique": "The document is an executive order that extends the operation of several advisory committees. It also amends a previous executive order related to the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The order itself doesn't express strong opinions on most of the axes, but the continuation of the advisory commission for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders suggests a slight lean towards social inclusion.",
