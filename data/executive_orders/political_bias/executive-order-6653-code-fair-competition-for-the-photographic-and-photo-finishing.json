    "critique": "This document approves a Code of Fair Competition for the Photographic and Photo Finishing Industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. This act is a clear example of government intervention in the economy. The document itself doesn't directly address social issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It centralizes power in the federal government through the administrator. Therefore, the initial scores reflect these observations.",
