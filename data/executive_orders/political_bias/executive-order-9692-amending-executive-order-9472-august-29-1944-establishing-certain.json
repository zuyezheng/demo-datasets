    "critique": "This document pertains to an amendment to an existing executive order regarding awards for the Merchant Marine. It primarily focuses on administrative details, specifically the authorization of a Merchant Marine Honorable Service Button and stipulations regarding its design to avoid duplication with other military awards. There is minimal ideological content, and it does not directly address issues related to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
