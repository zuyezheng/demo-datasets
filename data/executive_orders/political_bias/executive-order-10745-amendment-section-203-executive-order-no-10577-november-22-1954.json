    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the conversion of career-conditional appointments to career appointments for veterans with service-connected disabilities. It appears to be an effort to support veterans, a group that enjoys broad public support. There is no clear indication of a liberal or conservative ideological tilt. The order does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
