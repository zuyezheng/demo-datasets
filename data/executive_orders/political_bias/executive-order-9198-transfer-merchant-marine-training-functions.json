    "critique": "This executive order, issued during World War II, primarily concerns the transfer of functions, records, property, and personnel from the Coast Guard to the War Shipping Administration. It aims to expedite the war effort by streamlining administrative processes. Given the context of wartime, several factors influence the scoring. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on a left-right spectrum as it's a wartime measure. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is expanded to facilitate war functions. Federalism is strengthened as the order centralizes control. National security is prioritized. Economic regulation is increased to manage resources for the war. Social inclusion is not directly addressed.",
