    "critique": "This executive order concerns the Tule River Indian Reservation in California and restores a portion of it to the public domain. There is not enough information to assess ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order reduces the size of the reservation, which could be seen as favoring state control over federal control.",
