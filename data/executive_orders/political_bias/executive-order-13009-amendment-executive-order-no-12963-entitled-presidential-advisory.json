    "critique": "This document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order, increasing the membership of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS from 30 to 35. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that would strongly indicate bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The increase in advisory council members could be seen as a very slight move towards greater inclusion, but it's minimal.",
