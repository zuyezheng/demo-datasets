    "critique": "The document pertains to land allocation for Native American tribes, specifically the Pima and Maricopa Indians. It permanently withdraws certain tracts of land from settlement, entry, sale, or other disposition, designating it for their use and other Indians the Secretary of the Interior deems fit.
