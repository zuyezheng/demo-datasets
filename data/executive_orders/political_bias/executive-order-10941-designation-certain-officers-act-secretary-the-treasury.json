    "critique": "The document outlines the order of succession for the Secretary of the Treasury, focusing on maintaining operational continuity in the event of the Secretary and Under Secretary's absence or inability to serve. It does not express explicit opinions on ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral. The only exception is executive power, which is slightly expanded to ensure continuity of leadership.",
