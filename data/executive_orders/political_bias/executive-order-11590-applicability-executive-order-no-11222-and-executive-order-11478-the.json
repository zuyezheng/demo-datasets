    "critique": "This document extends two previous executive orders to apply to the United States Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission. Executive Order No. 11222 concerns standards of ethical conduct for government officers and employees. Executive Order No. 11478 relates to equal employment opportunity in the Federal Government. Extending these orders to the USPS and the Postal Rate Commission doesn't strongly indicate a shift in any of the axes. The document itself doesn't expand executive power, but rather applies existing orders to new entities. It promotes social inclusion by ensuring equal employment opportunities within the USPS and Postal Rate Commission. There is no impact on immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation.",
