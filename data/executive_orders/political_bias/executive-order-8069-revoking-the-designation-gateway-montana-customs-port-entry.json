It doesn't directly address ideological, immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion issues in a substantive way. Therefore, the initial and revised scores are set to neutral across all categories, reflecting the document's administrative nature and lack of explicit political bias.",
