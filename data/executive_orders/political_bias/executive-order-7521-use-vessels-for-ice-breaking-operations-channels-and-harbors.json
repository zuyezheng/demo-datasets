    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 directing the Coast Guard, under the Secretary of the Treasury, to conduct ice-breaking operations to maintain navigable channels and harbors for commerce. Other departments (War, Navy, Commerce) are directed to cooperate and provide vessels as needed. There is little to no indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, or impact on federalism. The order does not directly address national security vs. civil liberties or social inclusion. It has a very slight impact on economic regulation by facilitating commerce, but it's minimal. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0), with a slight positive nudge for economic regulation.",
