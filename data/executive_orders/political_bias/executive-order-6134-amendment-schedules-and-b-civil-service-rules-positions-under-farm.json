    "critique": "This document pertains to the internal organization of the Farm Credit Administration and the civil service rules governing its employees. It primarily deals with administrative matters, specifically the transfer of positions and the status of employees within the newly formed agency. There is little to suggest a strong ideological leaning, as the changes are largely structural and procedural. The document doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation in a general sense, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The exception might be a slight lean towards federal control, as it establishes a federal agency and its internal rules.",
