    "critique": "This document establishes the Kofa Game Range in Arizona, withdrawing lands from settlement to conserve wildlife and protect grazing lands. It balances conservation with resource extraction (mining) and pre-existing rights. Jurisdiction is split between Interior and Agriculture. It seems to favor conservation and federal control over land use, but also allows for grazing and mining. It does not touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has some elements of economic regulation through land use restrictions.",
