    "critique": "This document is an executive order that abolishes Michigan City, Indiana, as a customs port of entry. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores are neutral. The only exception might be federalism, where abolishing a port of entry could be seen as a slight shift towards federal control, but it's very minor.",
