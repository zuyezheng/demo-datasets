    "critique": "This is a war department document during the civil war. Ideologically, it is difficult to place on a left-right spectrum, but given the context of the civil war, it is likely more conservative. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is not expanded or restricted. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is fighting to maintain its power over the states. National security is prioritized over civil liberties. Economic regulation is not addressed. Social inclusion is not addressed.",
