    "critique": "This document establishes a bird refuge in Arizona. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The action is taken by the President, but it's within the scope of existing legislation (Migratory Bird Conservation Act), so it doesn't represent a significant expansion of executive power.",
