    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and its employees. It is based on the Railway Labor Act. There is nothing particularly liberal or conservative about this. It does not deal with immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It does not expand executive power, but rather follows the law. It has a slight impact on economic regulation, but not much. It does not deal with federalism.",
