    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1938 exempting Stanley Searles, an editor at the Bureau of American Ethnology, from mandatory retirement. It cites the public interest as the reason for the exemption. The document itself doesn't express strong opinions on most political dimensions, but the act of granting an exception could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power.",
