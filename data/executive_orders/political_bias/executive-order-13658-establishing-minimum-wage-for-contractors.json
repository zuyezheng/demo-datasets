    "critique": "This executive order mandates a minimum wage for federal contractors. This is a clear intervention in the economy, scoring positively on the Economic Regulation axis. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion, so those scores should be neutral. Ideologically, raising the minimum wage is generally considered a liberal policy.",
