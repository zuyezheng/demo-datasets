It specifies who can perform the duties of the Secretary of the Interior in their absence or sickness. There is nothing in this document to suggest any particular ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion or restriction of executive power, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation implications, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
