    "critique": "The document discusses the termination of Executive Order No. 9489, which authorized the Secretary of War to designate a military commander for the Territory of Hawaii and grant them certain powers. The termination is based on the determination that the exercise of authority conferred by the order is no longer necessary for national defense. The document also clarifies that the termination does not affect actions already taken by the military commander or any offenses/convictions related to violations of proclamations/orders issued by the commander.",
