    "critique": "The document revokes a special rule that gave preferential treatment to people who worked for the US military government of Cuba, allowing them to be retained and employed in the classified service. This could be seen as a move towards a more meritocratic system, but it also removes a benefit previously granted. There is not enough information to determine the ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, all axes are scored as neutral.",
