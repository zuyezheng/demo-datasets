    "critique": "This document is an executive order from Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, dealing with commercial intercourse between loyal and insurrectionary states. Given the context, several axes can be assessed. Ideological Tilt is difficult to gauge directly, but Lincoln's actions generally aimed to preserve the Union, which could be seen as moderately centrist in that specific context. Immigration is not relevant. Executive Power is expanded, as Lincoln uses his authority to license and permit commercial intercourse. Federalism is strengthened, as the federal government asserts control over commerce with states in insurrection. National Security is prioritized, as the order aims to favorably affect public interests during wartime. Economic Regulation is present, as the order regulates commercial activity. Social Inclusion is not directly addressed.",
