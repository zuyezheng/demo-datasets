It prioritizes the protection of human research subjects and issues in the management and use of genetic information. The order also directs executive branch departments and agencies to review their policies and procedures for protecting human research subjects. It does not touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
