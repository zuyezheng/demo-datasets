    "critique": "This executive order withdraws land from sale and settlement to set it apart for the use and occupancy of the Papago and other Indians. This action suggests a recognition of indigenous rights and a desire to protect their land. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts in the traditional left-right spectrum, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion beyond the specific context of Native American land rights. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight lean towards social inclusion due to the protection of indigenous people.",
