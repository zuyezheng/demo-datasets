    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1937 exempting an ambassador from mandatory retirement. It is a fairly specific action, so many of the axes are not strongly implicated. Ideologically, it's difficult to place, but given the era, a slight tilt towards moderate seems appropriate. Immigration is not relevant. Executive power is slightly expanded as it uses the power to exempt someone from a law. Federalism is not really relevant. National security vs. civil liberties is not really relevant. Economic regulation is not relevant. Social inclusion is not relevant.",
