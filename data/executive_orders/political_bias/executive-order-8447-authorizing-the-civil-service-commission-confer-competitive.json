    "critique": "This document pertains to the classification of certain Department of Labor employees under the Civil Service Act. It seems to be about internal government processes and employee status rather than broad political issues. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The economic regulation axis might lean slightly towards intervention due to the mention of wage determination, but it's not a strong influence. The social inclusion axis is neutral as the document specifies that employees must be citizens of the United States.",
