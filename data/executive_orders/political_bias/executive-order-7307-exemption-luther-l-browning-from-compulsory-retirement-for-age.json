    "critique": "This is an executive order that makes an exception to a rule about retirement age for a government employee. There is nothing here that indicates a liberal or conservative ideology. There is nothing about immigration. The order does expand executive power, but only very slightly, as it is a specific exemption allowed for in the law. There is nothing about federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral.",
