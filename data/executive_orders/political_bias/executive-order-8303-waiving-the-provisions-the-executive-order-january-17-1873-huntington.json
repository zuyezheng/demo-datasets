    "critique": "This document is a waiver for a federal employee to hold a position in a state government. It seems fairly neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion. It does touch on federalism and executive power. The federalism aspect is slightly in favor of state control as it allows a federal employee to work for the state. The executive power is slightly expanded as the President is granting a waiver.",
