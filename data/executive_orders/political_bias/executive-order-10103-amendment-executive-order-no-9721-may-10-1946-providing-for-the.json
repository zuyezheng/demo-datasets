    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the transfer of civilian employees in the Executive branch to public international organizations. It primarily deals with the terms and conditions of their employment, leave of absence, and reemployment with the Federal Government. There is no direct impact on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
