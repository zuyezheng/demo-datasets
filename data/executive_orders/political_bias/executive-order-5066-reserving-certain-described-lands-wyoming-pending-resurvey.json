    "critique": "This document concerns the opening of public lands in Wyoming to homesteading and desert land laws, specifically prioritizing ex-service men of the War with Germany. It revokes a previous executive order withdrawing the land pending a resurvey. There's a clear preference for veterans, but otherwise, it seems fairly neutral regarding modern political issues. The federal government is exercising control over federal lands, which is expected. There's a slight tilt towards traditional values by prioritizing veterans.",
