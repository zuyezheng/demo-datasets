    "critique": "The document revokes a previous executive order that declared a national emergency with respect to Panama, finding that the restoration of a democratically elected government in Panama has ended the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. It terminates the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12635 of April 8, 1988, with certain exceptions for pending actions, proceedings, rights, duties, or penalties. It also determines that the continuation of prohibitions with regard to transactions involving property in which the Government of Panama has an interest is necessary on account of claims involving Panama.",
