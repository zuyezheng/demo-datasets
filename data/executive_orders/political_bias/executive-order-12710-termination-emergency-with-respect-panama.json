    "critique": "This document revokes a previous executive order that declared a national emergency with respect to Panama. It finds that the restoration of a democratically elected government in Panama has ended the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The order terminates the national emergency but provides that the termination shall not affect any action taken or proceeding pending not finally concluded or determined as of the effective date of this order, or any action or proceeding based on any act committed prior to the effective date of this order, or any rights or duties that matured or penalties that were incurred prior to the effective date of this order. It also determines that the continuation of prohibitions with regard to transactions involving property in which the Government of Panama has an interest is necessary on account of claims involving Panama. The document does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It is more of an administrative action. The document does not directly address immigration. The document reduces executive power by terminating a national emergency. The document does not significantly impact federalism. The document reduces national security focus by terminating a national emergency. The document has a slight deregulation effect by terminating economic restrictions related to the national emergency. The document does not directly address social inclusion.",
