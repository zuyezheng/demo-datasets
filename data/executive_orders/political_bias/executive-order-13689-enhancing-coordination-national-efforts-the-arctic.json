    "critique": "Let's analyze this executive order regarding Arctic policy. It establishes an Arctic Executive Steering Committee to coordinate federal efforts in the region. The order emphasizes the strategic, ecological, cultural, and economic value of the Arctic, highlighting the impact of climate change and the need for international cooperation. It also stresses the importance of respecting the traditional knowledge of Alaska Native peoples and engaging with various stakeholders. The order itself doesn't directly address immigration, so that axis should be neutral. It also doesn't seem to directly expand executive power, but rather coordinates existing efforts. It does centralize federal efforts, so it leans towards federal primacy. It balances national security with environmental concerns and the rights of Arctic inhabitants. It promotes responsible resource development and environmental stewardship, suggesting moderate regulation. It also emphasizes collaboration with Alaska Native tribal governments and similar Alaska Native organizations, promoting social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
