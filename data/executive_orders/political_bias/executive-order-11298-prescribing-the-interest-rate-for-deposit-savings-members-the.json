    "critique": "This document is a directive from the President regarding the interest rate for deposits made by members of the uniformed services. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation in a broad sense, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The economic regulation aspect is very limited, pertaining only to a specific interest rate, so it's close to neutral but slightly interventionist.",
