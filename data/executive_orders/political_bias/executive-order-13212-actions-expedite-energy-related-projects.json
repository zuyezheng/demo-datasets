Immigration Approach: The document doesn't address immigration. Score: 0\n3.  Executive Power: The order establishes an interagency task force and directs agencies to expedite energy-related projects. This expands executive power by streamlining processes and prioritizing energy production. Score: 3\n4.  Federalism: The order mentions coordinating Federal, State, tribal, and local permitting, suggesting a cooperative approach. However, the establishment of a federal task force to monitor and assist implies a degree of federal oversight. Score: 2\n5.
