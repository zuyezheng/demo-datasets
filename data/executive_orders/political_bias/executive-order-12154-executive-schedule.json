    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the organization of the executive branch, specifically the placement of various positions within the Executive Schedule. It doesn't directly address issues related to ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The executive power axis is also neutral, as the order simply reassigns positions within the existing structure without significantly expanding or restricting executive authority.",
