    "critique": "This executive order pertains to a very specific situation regarding the leave of absence and reemployment rights of a single federal employee, Frederick Strauss, who transferred to a public international organization. It waives certain time limitations outlined in previous executive orders (9721 and 10103) specifically for him. Given the narrow scope and focus on a single individual's employment status, the document doesn't directly address broad ideological or political issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order does not seem to expand executive power in any meaningful way, as it is simply making an exception to existing rules for one person.",
