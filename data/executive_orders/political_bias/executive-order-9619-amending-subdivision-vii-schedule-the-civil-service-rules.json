    "critique": "This document is a minor amendment to Civil Service Rules, specifically adding a position to Schedule A. It's unlikely to have a significant impact on any of the axes. It doesn't obviously favor any political ideology, immigration approach, expand executive power, shift federalism, impact national security vs. civil liberties, regulate the economy, or promote social inclusion/conformity. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
