    "critique": "The document is a short executive order adding a position to the Civil Service Rules. It is difficult to assess the political bias and sentiment of such a document, as it is primarily administrative in nature. However, some assumptions can be made. The creation of a new position could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, and the fact that it is related to the Postmaster General could suggest a slight emphasis on federal control. However, these are very minor points and the document is largely neutral.",
