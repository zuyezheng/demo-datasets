    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1937 exempting a government employee from mandatory retirement. It does not touch on any of the major political issues of today. Therefore, most of the axes should be scored as neutral. The only exception might be executive power, which could be seen as slightly expanding it, but given the specific and limited nature of the order, it's best to keep it neutral as well.",
