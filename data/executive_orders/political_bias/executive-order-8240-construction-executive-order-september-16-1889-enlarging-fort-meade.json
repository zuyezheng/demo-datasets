    "critique": "This document pertains to land management and the correction of previous executive orders related to the Fort Meade Wood and Timber Military Reservation and the Black Hills National Forest. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The adjustment to existing orders could be seen as a very slight expansion of executive power, but it's primarily administrative.",
