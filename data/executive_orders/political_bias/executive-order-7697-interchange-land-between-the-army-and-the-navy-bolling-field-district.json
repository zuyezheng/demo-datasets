It outlines the specific boundaries of the transferred land using precise metes and bounds descriptions. There is no direct discussion or implication regarding ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, assessing bias along these axes is not applicable.",
