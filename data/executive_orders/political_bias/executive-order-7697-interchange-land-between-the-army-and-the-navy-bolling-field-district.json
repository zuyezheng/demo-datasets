    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1937 that transfers land between the War Department and the Navy Department. It's a technical document with no clear ideological slant. It doesn't touch on immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that transferring land for national defense slightly expands executive power and federal control, but the effect is minimal.",
