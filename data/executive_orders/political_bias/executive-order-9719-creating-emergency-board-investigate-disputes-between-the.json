    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate disputes between airlines and their employees, preventing changes to the conditions out of which the disputes arose for a limited time. It seems to be a fairly neutral intervention to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. There's no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, expansion of executive power beyond what's necessary for the investigation, or a shift in federalism. It appears to balance the interests of both carriers and employees, without favoring one over the other. There's no obvious impact on social inclusion. The economic regulation aspect is moderate, as it temporarily freezes the status quo but doesn't impose long-term controls.",
