    "critique": "This document establishes the Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge in Mississippi, transferring lands acquired under various New Deal-era acts to the Department of the Interior for wildlife preservation. It balances federal and state control by allowing the Secretary of Agriculture to continue managing certain activities like grazing and forestry, while the Interior Department handles wildlife. The order also restricts hunting and disturbing wildlife within the refuge, prioritizing conservation.",
