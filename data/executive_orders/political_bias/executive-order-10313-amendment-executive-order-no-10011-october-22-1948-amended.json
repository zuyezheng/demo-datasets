    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding allowances for government personnel on foreign duty. It amends a previous executive order and cites specific public laws as its authority. Given the subject matter, the document is unlikely to have a strong ideological tilt. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
