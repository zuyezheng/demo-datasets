It is difficult to assess political bias based on this document alone, as it does not contain substantial information on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The scores are set to neutral (0) across all axes, as there is no clear indication of bias in any particular direction.",
