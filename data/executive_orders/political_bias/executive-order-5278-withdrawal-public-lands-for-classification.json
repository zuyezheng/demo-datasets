    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1930 that temporarily withdraws public lands in Florida from settlement, location, sale, or entry for classification and determination of whether to include them in a national forest. It cites the authority of the acts of Congress approved June 25, 1910, and August 24, 1912. There is no information about immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The order does not obviously expand executive power, as it is subject to existing legislation and can be revoked by the President or Congress. It centralizes control over land use at the federal level, increasing federal power relative to the state. It could be seen as moderately interventionist in the economy by restricting land use for potential economic activities. It does not obviously lean liberal or conservative.",
