    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1938 that limits the quantity of red cedar shingles imported from Canada. It is based on Section 811 of the Revenue Act of 1936 and a reciprocal trade agreement with Canada. The order limits imports to 25% of the combined total of shipments and imports from the preceding half-calendar year. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security concerns, or social inclusion considerations. The primary focus is on economic regulation through import limitations.",
