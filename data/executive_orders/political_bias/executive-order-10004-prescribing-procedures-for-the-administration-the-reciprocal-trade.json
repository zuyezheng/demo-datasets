    "critique": "This document establishes committees and procedures for negotiating and administering trade agreements. It aims to balance the interests of various sectors of the American economy. There's a slight tilt towards economic interventionism as it involves government oversight and regulation of trade. It centralizes trade agreement processes at the federal level. It includes provisions for safeguarding domestic industries, which could be seen as a moderate national security focus in the economic sphere. There is no clear indication of a stance on immigration or social inclusion. It does expand executive power by creating committees under the president's authority.",
