    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1940 that waives civil service rules for a specific individual to be appointed as a rural letter carrier. It's a specific, targeted action. Ideological Tilt: This is hard to place on a left-right spectrum. It's an exception to standard hiring practices, but doesn't inherently favor a particular ideology. Immigration Approach: Not relevant. Executive Power: It expands executive power in a very limited way, by making an exception to civil service rules for one person. Federalism: Not relevant. National Security vs. Civil Liberties: Civil liberties are somewhat impacted, as standard hiring practices are bypassed, but it's a minor impact. Economic Regulation: Not relevant. Social Inclusion: Not relevant.Revised scores are below.",
