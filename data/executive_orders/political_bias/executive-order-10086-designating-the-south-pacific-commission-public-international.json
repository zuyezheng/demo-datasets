    "critique": "This document designates the South Pacific Commission as a public international organization, granting it certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities under the International Organizations Immunities Act. This action has minimal impact on most of the axes. It doesn't directly relate to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is neutral as it's a matter of international cooperation. Therefore, most scores should be zero.",
