    "critique": "This executive order establishes an advisory council on HIV/AIDS. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that would strongly indicate a particular bias. The order itself is fairly neutral in its language and intent, focusing on advice and information gathering. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
