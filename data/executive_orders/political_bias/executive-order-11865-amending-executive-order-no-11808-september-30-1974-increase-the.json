    "critique": "This document is an amendment to an existing executive order that increases the membership of the Executive Committee of the Economic Policy Board. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The expansion of the committee could be seen as a slight increase in government intervention.",
