    "critique": "This executive order concerns the prescription of components and quantities of Army and Air Force rations. It delegates authority to the Secretary of Defense and revokes several previous executive orders. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, or impact on civil liberties. It seems to be an administrative matter with minimal impact on the axes considered. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
