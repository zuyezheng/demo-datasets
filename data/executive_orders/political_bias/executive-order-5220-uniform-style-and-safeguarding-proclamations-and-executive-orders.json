    "critique": "This executive order focuses on standardizing the format and handling of Proclamations and Executive Orders. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. There's a very slight centralizing tendency in ensuring documents are handled and stored by the Department of State, which could be interpreted as a minor increase in federal control.",
