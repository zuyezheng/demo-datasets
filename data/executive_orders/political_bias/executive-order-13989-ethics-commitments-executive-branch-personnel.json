    "critique": "This executive order focuses on ethics and preventing conflicts of interest within the executive branch. It aims to limit the influence of lobbyists and ensure that government officials act in the public interest. There is a moderate tilt towards expanding executive power as it is an executive order, but it also includes provisions for waivers and limitations, suggesting a balanced approach.",
