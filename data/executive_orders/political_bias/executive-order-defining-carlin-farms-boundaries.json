    "critique": "This executive order from 1877 withdraws land from sale or settlement and sets it apart as a reservation for the Northwestern Shoshone Indians. Given the historical context, this action, while seemingly beneficial, was likely part of a larger policy of forced relocation and assimilation of Native Americans. Therefore, the social inclusion score is complex. The document itself doesn't explicitly expand executive power, but it does exercise it. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, or economic regulation. The action is federal, so it leans towards federal primacy.",
