    "critique": "This document describes the withdrawal of land for use by the Forest Service as a lookout station. It seems to be a fairly routine administrative action. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does shift control of the land to the federal government, so it leans towards federal primacy.",
