    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1939 that allows Henry Schneider to be appointed as an Investigator in the Alcohol Tax Unit without following Civil Service Rules. This seems like a minor exception to standard hiring practices. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on federalism. It might slightly expand executive power by bypassing standard rules, but it's a limited case. It doesn't directly address national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be near zero, with a slight positive score for executive power.",
