    "critique": "This executive order establishes an emergency board to investigate disputes between railroads and their employees. It aims to prevent interruptions to interstate commerce. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by creating the board, but it's a temporary measure within existing legal frameworks. It leans towards federalism by intervening in what could be seen as state matters, and it involves economic regulation by preventing changes to the conditions out of which the disputes arose. There's no direct impact on social inclusion.",
