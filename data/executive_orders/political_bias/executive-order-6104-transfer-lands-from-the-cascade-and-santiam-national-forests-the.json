    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the consolidation of two national forests. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to social issues such as immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It also does not directly address economic regulation. The order does shift control to the federal government, as it consolidates two national forests under a single name, but this is a relatively minor shift. The order itself doesn't expand executive power in a significant way; it's an administrative action authorized by existing law. Ideologically, it's fairly neutral, as conservation can be supported across the political spectrum.",
