    "critique": "This executive order from 1883 designates land in the Indian Territory for the Iowa and other Native American tribes as determined by the Secretary of the Interior. \n\n*   **Ideological Tilt:** Likely conservative for the time, as it deals with Native American land allocation, reflecting the prevailing policies of the era.

Score: -2\n*   **Executive Power:** Expands executive power by designating land use. Score: 3\n*   **Federalism:** Reinforces federal control over territories and Native American affairs.
