    "critique": "This document establishes the Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge. It appears to be a fairly standard executive action, transferring land for conservation purposes. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It does expand federal control over land use, and could be seen as a form of economic intervention by restricting land use. It also promotes social inclusion by protecting wildlife.",
