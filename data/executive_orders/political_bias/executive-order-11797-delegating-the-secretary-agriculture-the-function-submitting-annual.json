    "critique": "This document delegates authority from the President to the Secretary of Agriculture regarding reporting criteria and submission of annual reports to Congress concerning the location of new Federal facilities in rural areas. It encourages cooperation from other departments and agencies. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The delegation of authority could be seen as slightly restraining executive power, while the focus on federal facilities in rural areas might suggest a slight increase in federal control. Therefore, the initial scores are set accordingly and then revised after further consideration.",
