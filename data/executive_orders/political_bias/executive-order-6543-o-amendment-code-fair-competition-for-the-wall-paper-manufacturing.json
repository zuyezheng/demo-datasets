    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1933 approving amendments to the Code of Fair Competition for the Wall Paper Manufacturing Industry, under the National Industrial Recovery Act. Given the time period and context, several axes can be assessed. Ideological Tilt is moderately liberal due to the interventionist nature of the New Deal policies. Immigration is not addressed, so it is neutral. Executive Power is expanded as it's an executive order enacting economic policy. Federalism is strongly federal as the federal government is regulating industry. National Security vs. Civil Liberties is not directly addressed, so it's neutral. Economic Regulation is heavily interventionist. Social Inclusion is not directly addressed, so it's neutral.",
