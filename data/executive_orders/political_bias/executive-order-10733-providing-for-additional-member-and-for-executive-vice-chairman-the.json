It increases the committee size and specifies roles for the Chairman, Vice Chairman, and an Executive Vice Chairman. There's no explicit discussion of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral.",
