    "critique": "The document is an executive order providing expedited naturalization for aliens and non-citizens who served in the Armed Forces in the Grenada campaign. It expands executive power by defining the period and scope of qualifying service for naturalization exceptions. It also touches on immigration by providing a pathway to naturalization for a specific group of non-citizens. There is no direct impact on economic regulation, federalism, security vs. liberty, or social inclusion.",
