    "critique": "This document establishes the Souris-Red-Rainy River Basins Commission. It seems to be a fairly standard executive order, establishing a commission with members from various federal and state entities. There's nothing inherently ideological about it. It involves multiple states, so it's not heavily skewed towards state or federal control. It doesn't touch on civil liberties or national security. It has some economic implications in terms of resource management, but it's not heavy intervention. It doesn't seem to promote or hinder social inclusion. It does not deal with immigration at all. It does delegate authority to a commission, but it also sets a termination date, so it's not a huge expansion of executive power.",
