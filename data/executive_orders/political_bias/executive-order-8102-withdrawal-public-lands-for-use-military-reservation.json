    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1939 that withdraws public lands in Alaska for use as a military reservation under the control of the War Department. It does not directly address ideological tilts, immigration, or social inclusion. It expands executive power by withdrawing land, and it centralizes control at the federal level. It could be argued that this is for national security. There is no economic regulation mentioned.",
