    "critique": "The document aims to limit the power of executive agencies by ensuring that regulations are properly enacted through statutes or regulations, and that the public has fair notice of their obligations. It emphasizes transparency and public input in the regulatory process, and seeks to prevent agencies from using non-binding guidance documents to impose legally binding requirements on the public without following the proper rulemaking procedures. It promotes deregulation by limiting the scope of agency power.",
