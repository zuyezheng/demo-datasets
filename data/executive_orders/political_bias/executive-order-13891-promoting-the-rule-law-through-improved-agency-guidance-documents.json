    "critique": "This executive order aims to increase transparency and accountability in the regulatory process by requiring agencies to treat guidance documents as non-binding, make them publicly available, and solicit public input. It emphasizes adherence to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and existing executive orders related to regulatory review. The order seeks to limit the power of agencies to impose obligations on the public without proper rulemaking procedures. It could be seen as deregulation, as it restricts the use of guidance documents to enforce regulations without going through the full rulemaking process. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. It leans towards deregulation and limiting government intervention in the economy.\n\nIdeological Tilt: The emphasis on limiting regulatory burdens and increasing transparency aligns with conservative principles. Score: -2\nImmigration Approach: This order does not address immigration. Score: 0\nExecutive Power: The order seeks to limit the power of agencies and ensure they follow proper procedures, which could be seen as restraining executive authority.
