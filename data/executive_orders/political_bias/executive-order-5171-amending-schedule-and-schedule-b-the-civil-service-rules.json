    "critique": "The document primarily concerns civil service rules and appointments within the State Department. It revokes an exception for 'officers to aid in important drafting work,' grants classified competitive status to specific individuals, and adds a new subdivision to Schedule B for specialists in foreign relations. There is a very slight tilt towards expanding the role of government and potentially increasing diversity/inclusion through standardized qualifications.",
