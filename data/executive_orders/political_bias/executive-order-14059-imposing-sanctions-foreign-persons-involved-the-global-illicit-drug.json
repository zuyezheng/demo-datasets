    "critique": "This executive order declares a national emergency to address international drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. It authorizes sanctions against foreign persons involved in the illicit drug trade. The order invokes the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (NEA), and the Fentanyl Sanctions Act (FSA), among other laws. It allows the Secretary of the Treasury to block assets, prohibit financial transactions, and restrict entry into the United States for individuals involved in drug trafficking. The order also includes provisions to prevent evasion of sanctions and to ensure that donations do not undermine the effort to combat drug trafficking. It is signed by President Biden and dated December 15, 2021.\n\nIdeological Tilt: The order is difficult to place on a traditional left-right spectrum. While addressing drug trafficking can be seen as a law-and-order issue, which is often associated with conservative politics, the focus on international cooperation and the use of sanctions could also be seen as aligned with liberal internationalist approaches. I will score it as slightly conservative due to the law-and-order aspect.\n\nImmigration Approach: The order restricts the entry of non-citizens involved in drug trafficking, which indicates a restrictive approach to immigration. Therefore, I will score it as restrictive.\n\nExecutive Power: The order invokes emergency powers and expands the executive's authority to impose sanctions and restrict entry. This suggests an expansion of executive power. I will score it as such.\n\nFederalism: The order focuses on federal action to address a national problem, indicating a strong federal role. I will score it as favoring federal control.\n\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The order prioritizes national security by targeting drug trafficking, potentially at the expense of some civil liberties for those sanctioned. I will score it as leaning towards national security.\n\nEconomic Regulation: The order imposes financial sanctions and restrictions on transactions, indicating government intervention in the economy. I will score it as interventionist.\n\nSocial Inclusion: The order does not directly address social inclusion issues. It is primarily focused on combating drug trafficking. Therefore, I will score it as neutral.",
