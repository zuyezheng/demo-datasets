    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the administration of the Canal Zone, focusing on employment standards, a merit system, and a board of appeals for employees. It delegates authority to the Secretary of the Army and emphasizes uniform application of standards irrespective of citizenship (US or Panama). There's a balance between security concerns (allowing US citizen-only positions) and merit-based employment. It also establishes a board of appeals for employees. It doesn't directly address immigration in a broader sense, nor does it drastically expand executive power beyond administrative delegation. It seems to balance federal oversight with some local considerations within the Canal Zone. It also seems to promote diversity by ensuring equal opportunity for both US and Panamanian citizens. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
