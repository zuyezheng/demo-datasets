    "critique": "This document primarily concerns land management and boundary adjustments within national forests. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, or civil liberties. The actions are administrative and technical in nature. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. There's a slight shift towards federalism as it involves federal lands, but it's not a major policy change.",
