    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the Joint Mexican-United States Defense Commission. It modifies the composition of the United States membership by specifying that members will be designated by the Secretary of Defense and serve at their pleasure. It also clarifies that the amendment does not automatically terminate the tenure of existing members but allows the Secretary of Defense to do so. Given the subject matter and the limited scope of the order, the ideological tilt is neutral. The order does not directly address immigration. It slightly expands executive power by giving the Secretary of Defense more control over the commission's membership. It has no direct impact on federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, these aspects are also neutral.",
