    "critique": "This document pertains to the extension of the customs port of entry of Brownsville, Texas. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only axis that might have a slight lean is federalism, as it involves a federal action related to customs, but it's a very minor adjustment.",
