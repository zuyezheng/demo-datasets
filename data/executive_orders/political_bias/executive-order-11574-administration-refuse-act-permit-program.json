    "critique": "This document establishes a permit program to regulate the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. It delegates responsibilities to various federal agencies, including the Secretary of the Army, the EPA Administrator, and the Attorney General. The Council on Environmental Quality is tasked with coordinating the program. The order references several existing laws related to water pollution control, fish and wildlife coordination, and environmental policy.\n\nIdeological Tilt: The document promotes environmental protection, which aligns with a liberal stance. However, it also involves government regulation of industry, which can be seen as interventionist. I'll give it a +2.\nImmigration Approach: This document has nothing to do with immigration, so I will score it as 0.\nExecutive Power: The document delegates authority to various agencies but doesn't significantly expand or restrict executive power. I'll score it as 0.\nFederalism: The document establishes a federal permit program, indicating a move towards federal control. I'll score it as +3.\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: This document does not directly address national security or civil liberties, so I will score it as 0.\nEconomic Regulation: The document implements a permit program to regulate pollution, which implies government intervention in the economy. I'll score it as +3.\nSocial Inclusion: This document does not directly address social inclusion, so I will score it as 0.\n\nRevised Scores:\nIdeological Tilt: +2 (Slightly Liberal)\nImmigration Approach: 0 (Neutral)\nExecutive Power: 0 (Neutral)\nFederalism: +3 (Strong Federal Control)\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0 (Balanced Approach)\nEconomic Regulation: +3 (Heavy Government Intervention)\nSocial Inclusion: 0 (Neutral)",
