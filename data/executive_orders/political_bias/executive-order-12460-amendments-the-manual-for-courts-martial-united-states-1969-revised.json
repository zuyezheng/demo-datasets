    "critique": "This document amends the Manual for Courts-Martial regarding capital cases. It outlines procedures and aggravating circumstances for imposing the death penalty. It does not directly relate to immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it expands executive power by prescribing amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial, but this is a standard function. It leans towards national security by defining aggravating circumstances related to national security damage. The focus is on due process within the military justice system regarding capital punishment.",
