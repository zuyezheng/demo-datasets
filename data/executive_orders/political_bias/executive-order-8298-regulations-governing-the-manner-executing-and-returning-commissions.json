    "critique": "This document outlines regulations for executing commissions related to foreign documents in criminal cases. It primarily focuses on the process and fees associated with obtaining testimony and does not directly address broad ideological or political issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document does not seem to expand executive power, as it is based on existing legislation and provides specific guidelines. It also doesn't significantly impact federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Immigration is touched upon indirectly, but not in a way that suggests a specific approach.",
