    "critique": "The document is a presidential order from 1936 that reserves public lands in Teton County, Wyoming, for the Department of Agriculture as an addition to the Elk Refuge. It primarily concerns land management and conservation. There is no explicit discussion of immigration, executive power, federalism, security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral. The document does not express a clear ideological tilt.",
