    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 that adds land to the Elk Refuge in Teton County, Wyoming. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt as it primarily concerns land management and conservation. There's no direct impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
