    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on promoting the use of AI within the US government in a responsible and ethical manner. It emphasizes innovation, public trust, and adherence to American values, laws, and policies. It includes principles for AI use, implementation guidelines, and interagency coordination. The document does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that would strongly indicate a bias in any particular direction. Therefore, most scores are neutral.",
