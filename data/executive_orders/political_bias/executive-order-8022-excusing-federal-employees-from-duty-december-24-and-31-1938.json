    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1938 closing government offices on the Saturdays before Christmas and New Year's Day. This seems like a fairly neutral action with minimal political implications. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
