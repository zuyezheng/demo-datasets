    "critique": "This executive order establishes a Presidential Advisory Board on Ambassadorial Appointments. It outlines the board's responsibilities, membership, and operational guidelines. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. The order doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order delegates authority to the Secretary of State for administrative functions and compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which could be seen as a slight shift in federal power, but it's minimal. The board's purpose is advisory, and its impact on policy is indirect. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
