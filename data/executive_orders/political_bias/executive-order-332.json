    "critique": "This document pertains to the internal administration of the West Point Military Academy. It involves a relatively minor restructuring of oversight responsibilities, shifting some duties from the Military Department of West Point to the General of the Army under the War Department. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or impact on civil liberties. The changes do not obviously expand executive power, alter the balance of federalism, or directly regulate the economy. The document does not address social inclusion or diversity. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
