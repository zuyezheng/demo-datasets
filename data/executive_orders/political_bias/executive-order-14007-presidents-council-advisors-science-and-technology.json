    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). It aims to ensure evidence-based policymaking by seeking scientific and technological advice from experts. The order itself doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that allows for strong scoring. However, the emphasis on \"racial equity\" as a topic for the PCAST to advise on suggests a slight lean towards social inclusion. The focus on science and technology could be seen as generally aligned with liberal values, but it's not overtly ideological. The establishment of an advisory council doesn't inherently expand executive power. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral, with a slight positive score for social inclusion and ideological tilt.",
