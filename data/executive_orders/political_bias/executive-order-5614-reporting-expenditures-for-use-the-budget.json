    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the reporting of expenditures in the budget. It seems to be an administrative order to ensure compliance with the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. There is nothing to suggest any ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion or restriction of executive power, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
