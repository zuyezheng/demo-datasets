    "critique": "This document pertains to the Inter-American Coffee Agreement and adjustments to coffee import quotas. It's primarily an economic regulation with international trade implications. There's no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power expansion, federalism concerns, national security implications, or social inclusion matters. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The economic regulation aspect is present but not strongly interventionist, so a slightly positive score is appropriate.",
