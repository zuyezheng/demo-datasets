    "critique": "This executive order extends the classified civil service to positions within the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This move could be seen as increasing federal control and potentially reducing flexibility in hiring within the FDIC. However, it also promotes a merit-based system and potentially reduces political influence in hiring decisions. It's difficult to assess the ideological tilt without more context, but it seems to be a move towards standardization and potentially less political patronage. There is no mention of immigration, national security, or social inclusion. The economic regulation aspect is indirect, as it affects the FDIC, but it's not a direct regulatory action. The federalism aspect is slightly towards federal control, as it standardizes hiring practices within a federal agency.",
