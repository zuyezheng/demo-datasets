    "critique": "The document establishes a commission to advise the President on bioethical issues. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power by creating a commission, but this is a relatively minor expansion. It does not seem to significantly impact federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are mostly neutral.",
