It aims to ensure ethical responsibility in scientific research, healthcare delivery, and technological innovation. The commission is authorized to conduct research, hold hearings, and develop reports. It does not promote a specific ideological tilt but rather seeks to provide balanced advice on complex issues. The order does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral.",
