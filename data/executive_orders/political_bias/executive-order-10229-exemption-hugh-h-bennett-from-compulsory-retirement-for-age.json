    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts Hugh H. Bennett, Chief of the Soil Conservation Service, from compulsory retirement for one year. It does not seem to have any significant implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it touches upon is executive power, as it uses the authority vested in the president to make this exemption. However, this is a fairly routine administrative action and does not represent a significant expansion of executive power.",
