    "critique": "This executive order focuses on streamlining trade processes and improving coordination among federal agencies related to border management. It aims to reduce supply chain barriers, enhance economic competitiveness, and promote compliance with trade laws. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. The order emphasizes collaboration and efficiency, with no clear indication of favoring state or federal control. It seeks to balance security with trade facilitation, and it doesn't directly address social inclusion or economic regulation in a significant way. Therefore, most scores should be close to neutral. However, the emphasis on national security and border control suggests a slight leaning towards prioritizing security over liberty. The focus on reducing regulatory burdens could be interpreted as a slight move towards deregulation.",
