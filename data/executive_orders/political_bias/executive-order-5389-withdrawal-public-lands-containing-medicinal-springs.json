    "critique": "This document is an executive order withdrawing land containing hot springs from settlement, location, sale, or entry, and reserving it for lease. It cites the authority of acts of Congress from 1910, 1912 and 1925. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It does not relate to immigration. It is difficult to assess whether this expands executive power, as it is based on existing legislation. It could be argued that reserving land for federal lease strengthens federal control. It does not directly relate to national security or civil liberties. It could be argued that reserving land for federal lease is a form of economic intervention. It does not seem to relate to social inclusion.",
