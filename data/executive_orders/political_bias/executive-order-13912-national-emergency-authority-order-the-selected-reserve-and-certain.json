    "critique": "This document is an executive order invoking emergency authority in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It authorizes the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to activate reserve units and individual members of the Ready Reserve. It does not explicitly address ideological issues, immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It expands executive power by invoking emergency authority and federalism by giving more power to the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security. It leans towards national security by mobilizing the Ready Reserve.",
