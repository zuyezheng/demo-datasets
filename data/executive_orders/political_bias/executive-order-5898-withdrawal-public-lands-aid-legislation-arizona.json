    "critique": "This document is an executive order that withdraws land in Arizona from settlement, location, sale, or entry to potentially be used by the University of Arizona. It does not seem to have any implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It seems to favor state control since it is enabling Arizona to secure land for its university.",
