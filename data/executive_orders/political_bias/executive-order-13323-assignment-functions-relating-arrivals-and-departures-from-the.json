    "critique": "This executive order focuses on managing the arrival and departure of persons from the United States, assigning functions to the Secretaries of Homeland Security and State. It strengthens national security through control of who enters and exits the country. There is no mention of economic regulation or social inclusion. The order does not seem to obviously expand executive power, but it does centralize control over immigration and travel at the federal level. It also prioritizes national security. It is difficult to assess ideological tilt without more context, but the emphasis on national security and immigration control suggests a conservative leaning. Immigration is restrictive, but not extremely so. Federalism is strengthened. Liberties are somewhat weakened. There is no economic regulation or social inclusion impact.",
