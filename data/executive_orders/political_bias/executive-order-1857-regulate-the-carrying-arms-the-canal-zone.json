    "critique": "This document establishes rules for carrying firearms in the Canal Zone in 1913. It restricts the carrying of weapons, but provides exceptions for military personnel, law enforcement, and those with permits. The Head of the Department of Civil Administration has broad discretion in granting permits. The document reflects a concern for public order and safety, but also acknowledges the need for hunting and self-defense. There is a bias towards conformity and traditional uniformity. It is hard to judge where this falls on the traditional left-right political spectrum because it is a very specific issue. It does expand executive power by giving the Head of the Department of Civil Administration broad discretion. It does not deal with immigration, federalism, or national security vs. civil liberties. It does not deal with economic regulation.",
