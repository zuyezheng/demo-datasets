    "critique": "The document establishes the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) to coordinate export promotion and financing activities. It centralizes authority under the Secretary of Commerce and aims for a unified, government-wide strategic plan. There is no discussion of immigration. The order expands executive power through the discretion given to the President to include other departments or agencies in the committee. The plan does not explicitly address civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion, so it is difficult to assess.",
