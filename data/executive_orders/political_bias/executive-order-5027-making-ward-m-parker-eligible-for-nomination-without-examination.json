    "critique": "This executive order waives the civil service examination requirement for a specific postmaster appointment. It appears to be a case of political patronage or addressing a specific staffing issue rather than a broad policy change. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The executive power axis might lean slightly towards expansion, as it's a specific waiver, but it's not a significant expansion.",
