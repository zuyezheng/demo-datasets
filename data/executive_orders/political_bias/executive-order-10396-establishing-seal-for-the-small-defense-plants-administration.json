    "critique": "This document establishes the official seal for the Small Defense Plants Administration. It is largely symbolic and administrative in nature, with minimal direct impact on the axes of political bias. The creation of a seal doesn't inherently lean liberal or conservative, affect immigration, expand executive power, alter federalism, impact national security vs. civil liberties, regulate the economy, or promote social inclusion/conformity. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0).",
