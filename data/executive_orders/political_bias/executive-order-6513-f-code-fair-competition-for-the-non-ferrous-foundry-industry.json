    "critique": "The document is an approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Non-Ferrous Foundry Industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. This act is a clear example of government intervention in the economy during the Great Depression. Therefore, economic regulation should be high. The document itself doesn't directly address social issues, immigration, or civil liberties, so those scores should be neutral. The document expands federal power over industry, so federalism should be positive. The executive power is being used to enact the law, so it should be slightly positive. The ideological tilt is moderately liberal due to the interventionist economic policies.",
