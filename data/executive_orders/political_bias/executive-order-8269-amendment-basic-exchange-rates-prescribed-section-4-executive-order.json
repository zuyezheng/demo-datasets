    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending basic exchange rates for foreign currencies in relation to the American dollar. It adjusts rates for losses sustained by US personnel in foreign countries due to currency appreciation. The order specifies an effective date and a temporary rate for Danzig.The document does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation in a broad sense, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral. The slight intervention in currency exchange could be interpreted as a minor economic regulation.",
