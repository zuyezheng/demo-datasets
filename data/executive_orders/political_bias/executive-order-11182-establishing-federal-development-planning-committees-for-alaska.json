    "critique": "This executive order establishes committees to coordinate federal and state programs for economic and resource development in Alaska following an earthquake. It appears to be a fairly centrist, pragmatic approach to disaster recovery and long-term planning. There's a slight tilt towards federal coordination, but it emphasizes cooperation with the state government. There's no obvious stance on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It leans slightly towards government intervention in economic development, but within the context of disaster recovery and long-term planning.",
