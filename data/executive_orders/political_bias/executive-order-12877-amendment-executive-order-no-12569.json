    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding relations with Freely Associated States. It primarily concerns the roles of the Secretary of State and other executive departments in relation to these states. There's no indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, or civil liberties issues. It seems to maintain a balance of power and doesn't heavily regulate the economy or promote social conformity. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
