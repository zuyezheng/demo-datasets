    "critique": "This executive order establishes a task force on victims of crime. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that allows for a strong positive or negative score. The task force is meant to advise the President and Attorney General, which could be seen as a slight centralization, but it's not a major shift. The focus on victims of crime could be interpreted as leaning towards national security, but it's also about justice and support. Therefore, most scores should be close to neutral.",
