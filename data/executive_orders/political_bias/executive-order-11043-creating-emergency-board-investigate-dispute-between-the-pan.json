    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between an airline and its employees. It is a fairly neutral action, intervening in a labor dispute to ensure the continuation of essential transportation services. It doesn't strongly lean in any particular ideological direction, nor does it obviously affect immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The creation of the board could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's within the bounds of existing law (Railway Labor Act).",
