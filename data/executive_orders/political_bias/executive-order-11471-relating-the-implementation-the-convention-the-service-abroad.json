    "critique": "The document outlines the designation of authorities within the US government to implement the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents. It focuses on the procedural aspects of international legal cooperation, specifically the service of legal documents across borders. There is no discussion of immigration, social issues, or economic policy. The order designates the Department of State as the Central Authority and specifies who is authorized to complete certificates related to the service of documents. The document does not express opinions on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral.",
