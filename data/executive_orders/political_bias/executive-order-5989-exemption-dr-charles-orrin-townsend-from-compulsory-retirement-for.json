    "critique": "This document is an executive order that makes an exception to a mandatory retirement age for a government employee. It does not seem to have any implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it seems to affect is executive power, as it is an example of the executive branch using its authority to make an exception to a law.",
