    "critique": "This document is a transfer of land from federal to territorial control. It is unlikely to have strong implications for any of the axes. The transfer of land back to the Territory of Hawaii could be seen as a slight move towards state control, but it is very minor. The document itself is very technical and does not express any ideological viewpoints.",
