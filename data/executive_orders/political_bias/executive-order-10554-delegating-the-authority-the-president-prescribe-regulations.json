    "critique": "This document delegates authority regarding military uniforms to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Treasury. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The delegation of authority could be seen as a very slight reduction in executive power, but it's minimal.",
