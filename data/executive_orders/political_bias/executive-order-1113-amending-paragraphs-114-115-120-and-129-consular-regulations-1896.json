It outlines specific guidelines for addressing, formatting, and marking despatches, as well as discouraging private correspondence on official matters. There is little to no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, executive power dynamics, federalism, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
