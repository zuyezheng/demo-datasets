    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate disputes between railroads and their employees. It seems to be a fairly neutral action, intervening in a labor dispute to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. It doesn't strongly lean in any particular ideological direction, nor does it obviously affect immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has a moderate impact on economic regulation.",
