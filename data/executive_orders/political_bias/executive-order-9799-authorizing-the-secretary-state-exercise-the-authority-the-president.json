    "critique": "This document is a directive to the Secretary of State regarding the classification of chiefs of mission positions. It seems primarily administrative in nature, with little direct impact on the axes of political bias. It doesn't obviously lean liberal or conservative, affect immigration, expand executive power significantly, alter federalism, impact national security vs. civil liberties, regulate the economy, or address social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
