It focuses on the duration of appointments and their connection to the expiration of emergency appropriations. The document itself doesn't express strong opinions on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial and revised scores are mostly neutral.",
