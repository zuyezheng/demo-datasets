It is difficult to assess the document on the axes provided because it is a statement of gratitude for a military victory. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 0.",
