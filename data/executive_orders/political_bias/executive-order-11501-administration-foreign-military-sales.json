    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating authority related to the Foreign Military Sales Act to the Secretaries of State and Defense. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It primarily concerns the distribution of executive power and federalism by allocating responsibilities between different federal departments. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The delegation of power could be seen as slightly expanding executive power, but it's more of an internal reallocation than a significant expansion. There is no obvious impact on state vs federal power.",
