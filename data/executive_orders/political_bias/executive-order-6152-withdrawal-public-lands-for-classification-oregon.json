    "critique": "This document is an executive order that withdraws public lands in Oregon for classification as a migratory bird refuge. It does not seem to have any strong ideological slant, immigration implications, or impact on civil liberties. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by withdrawing the lands, but this is a fairly standard use of executive authority. It also seems to favor federal control over state control, as it is a federal action impacting state lands. There is a slight intervention in the economy by restricting land use. It doesn't seem to have any impact on social inclusion.",
