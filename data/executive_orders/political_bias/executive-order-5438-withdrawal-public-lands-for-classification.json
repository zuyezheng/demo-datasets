    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order for the state of Arizona in 1930. It withdraws public lands for classification and in aid of legislation. It does not touch upon immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It is a federal action, so it leans towards federal primacy. Given that it was enacted in 1930, it is difficult to assess its ideological tilt without more context, but I will assume it is neutral. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration: 0, Executive Power: 0, Federalism: 3, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0, Economic Regulation: 0, Social Inclusion: 0. After further consideration, the federalism score should be lower, as this is a fairly routine action and doesn't dramatically shift the balance of power. I will revise it to 1.",
