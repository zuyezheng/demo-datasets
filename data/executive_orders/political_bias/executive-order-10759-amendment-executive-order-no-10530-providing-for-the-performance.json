It appears to be a technical adjustment related to government administration and employee benefits. There is no indication of a specific ideological tilt, immigration policy, expansion of executive power, or shift in federalism. It does not directly address national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 0.",
