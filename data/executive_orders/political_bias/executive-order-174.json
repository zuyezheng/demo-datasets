    "critique": "This document is a straightforward delegation of authority within the Department of War, specifying who should perform the duties of the Secretary of War in specific absence scenarios. There's no indication of ideological leaning, immigration policy, or any impact on civil liberties. It seems primarily concerned with maintaining operational continuity within the War Department. The delegation to military officers might suggest a slight expansion of executive power within the military context, but it's more about internal management than a broad shift in power. There's no clear impact on federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight lean towards executive power expansion.",
