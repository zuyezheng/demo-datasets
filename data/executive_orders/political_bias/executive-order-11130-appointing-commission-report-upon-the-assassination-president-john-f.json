    "critique": "This document establishes a commission to investigate the assassination of JFK. It is signed by the President. It does not obviously relate to any of the axes in a way that would deviate from zero. It could be argued that it expands executive power, but the act of creating a commission is not inherently an expansion of power. It could also be argued that it relates to national security, but again, it is not obvious that it does so in a way that would deviate from a balanced approach.",
