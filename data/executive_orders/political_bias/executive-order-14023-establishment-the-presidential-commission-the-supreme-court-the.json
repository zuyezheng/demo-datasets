    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to study the Supreme Court. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt without knowing the specific focus of the commission's inquiry. However, the commission's mandate to analyze arguments for and against Supreme Court reform suggests a potential for changes that could be seen as either liberal or conservative, depending on the nature of the reforms considered. Immigration is not addressed. The creation of a commission does expand executive power, albeit in a limited way. Federalism is not directly impacted. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly impacted. Economic regulation is not addressed. Social inclusion is not directly impacted.",
