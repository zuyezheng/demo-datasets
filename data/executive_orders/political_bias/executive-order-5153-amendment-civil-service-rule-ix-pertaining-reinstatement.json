It outlines the conditions and time limitations for reinstating individuals to their previous government positions. There is no immediately obvious ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on executive power. It seems to have a neutral stance on federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, initial scores are all set to 0.",
