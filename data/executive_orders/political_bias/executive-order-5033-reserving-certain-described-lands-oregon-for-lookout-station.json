    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal for a lookout station in Oregon. It doesn't directly address any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The federal government is allowing the state to use the land, which could be seen as a slight move towards state control, but it's very minor.",
