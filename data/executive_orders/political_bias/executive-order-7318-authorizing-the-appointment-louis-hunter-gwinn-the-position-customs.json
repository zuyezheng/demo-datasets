    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 that allows for the appointment of an individual to a Customs Agent position without adhering to Civil Service Rules. The rationale provided is that the Secretary of the Treasury believes the appointment is in the interest of the service. Given the limited information, assessing the document across all axes is challenging, but here's an attempt:\n\n1.  Ideological Tilt: It's difficult to assess the ideological tilt without more context. The action could be seen as pragmatic or potentially patronage-based. I will assign a score of 0.\n2.  Immigration Approach: The document relates to customs, which has implications for immigration, but the order itself doesn't directly address immigration policy. I will assign a score of 0.\n3.  Executive Power: The order waives Civil Service Rules for a specific appointment, suggesting an expansion of executive power, albeit in a limited scope. I will assign a score of 2.\n4.  Federalism: The order doesn't explicitly shift power between state and federal entities. I will assign a score of 0.\n5.  National Security vs. Civil Liberties: Waiving Civil Service Rules could potentially impact the quality and impartiality of customs agents, which could have implications for both national security and civil liberties. However, without more information, it's hard to say definitively. I will assign a score of 0.\n6.  Economic Regulation: The document doesn't directly address economic regulation. I will assign a score of 0.\n7.  Social Inclusion: Waiving Civil Service Rules could potentially open the door to patronage or discrimination, but it's not clear from the document. I will assign a score of 0.\n\nRevised Scores:\nAfter further consideration, the initial scores seem reasonable given the limited information. The executive power score could be slightly lower, but the potential for patronage warrants a score above neutral.",
