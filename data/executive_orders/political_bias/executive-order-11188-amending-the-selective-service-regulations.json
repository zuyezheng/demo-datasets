    "critique": "This document amends Selective Service Regulations, primarily concerning exemptions, deferments, and classifications for military service. It addresses various categories of individuals, including aliens, students, and members of reserve components. There's a focus on updating regulations based on amendments to the Universal Military Training and Service Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act. The document does not directly address economic regulation, social inclusion, or executive power in a significant way. It mainly clarifies and updates existing procedures related to military service eligibility and obligations. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with slight leanings based on the specific changes made.",
