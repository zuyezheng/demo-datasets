    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1965 that allows the House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations to inspect tax returns from 1947-1966. It cites the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and 1954 as its authority. It aims to study the economy and efficiency of the government. There is nothing particularly liberal or conservative about this. It does give more power to the federal government, but it is balanced by the fact that it is giving power to the legislative branch to check on the executive branch. It does not touch on immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
