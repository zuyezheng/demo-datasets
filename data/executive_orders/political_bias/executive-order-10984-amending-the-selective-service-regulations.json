There is a strong emphasis on national security and maintaining military readiness, with adjustments made to accommodate volunteers, those with critical skills, and those not fully qualified for service except in times of war or national emergency. The document centralizes control at the federal level, streamlining processes and ensuring compliance with national standards. There is no discussion of immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
