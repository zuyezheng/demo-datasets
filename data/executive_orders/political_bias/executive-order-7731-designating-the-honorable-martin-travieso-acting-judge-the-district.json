    "critique": "This document is a designation of authority for a judge to preside over a specific case due to a conflict of interest. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The executive power is slightly expanded in the sense that the president is designating a judge, but it's a very specific and limited action.",
