    "critique": "The document emphasizes deregulation, cost-benefit analysis, and flexibility in regulation, suggesting a conservative economic approach. It also stresses public participation and transparency, which could be seen as neutral. However, the focus on reducing burdens and promoting innovation aligns with a less interventionist stance. The document doesn't directly address social issues or immigration, making those axes neutral. It also doesn't significantly alter the balance of power between the executive and other branches or between the federal and state governments.",
