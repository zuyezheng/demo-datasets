    "critique": "This executive order focuses on improving the regulatory process by emphasizing public participation, cost-benefit analysis, and the use of the best available science. It aims to reduce burdens, promote innovation, and ensure regulations are effective and accessible. The order reaffirms principles from Executive Order 12866, suggesting a continuation of established regulatory review processes. There's a focus on flexibility, transparency, and retrospective analysis of existing rules. The order doesn't seem to strongly favor any particular ideology but rather seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of regulation. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. The emphasis on cost-benefit analysis and reducing burdens suggests a slight lean towards deregulation, but it's not a strong stance. Therefore, most scores are neutral, with a slight lean towards deregulation.",
