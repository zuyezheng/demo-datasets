    "critique": "This executive order primarily deals with trade expansion and the delegation of authority related to the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. It establishes the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations and outlines their functions, as well as establishing the Trade Expansion Act Advisory Committee. There's nothing inherently liberal or conservative in the document itself; it's more about the structure and process of trade negotiations. Immigration, civil liberties, and social inclusion are not directly addressed. There's a slight shift towards federal control as it centralizes trade negotiation authority. Economic regulation is indirectly addressed as the order facilitates trade agreements, but it doesn't explicitly promote deregulation or intervention. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
