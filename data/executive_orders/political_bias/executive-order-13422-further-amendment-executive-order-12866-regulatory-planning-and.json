    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous executive order (12866) to include 'guidance documents' under the same regulatory review process as 'regulations'. This suggests a move towards greater oversight and control over agency actions, even those not formally classified as regulations. It requires agencies to identify market failures justifying new actions and to assess the significance of problems they intend to address. It also emphasizes cost-benefit analysis and coordination among agencies. The inclusion of guidance documents aims to increase transparency and accountability. It doesn't directly address social issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It leans towards economic deregulation by requiring justification for regulatory actions and cost-benefit analysis. It centralizes power by giving OIRA more oversight.",
