    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous order (EO 10450) regarding security requirements for government employment. The amendment broadens the definition of disqualifying conditions to include any illness, including mental conditions, that may cause a significant defect in judgment or reliability. This raises concerns about potential discrimination against individuals with mental health conditions. The order cites national security as the justification for this change.",
