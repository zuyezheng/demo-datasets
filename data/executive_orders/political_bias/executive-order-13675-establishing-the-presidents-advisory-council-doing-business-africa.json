    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on promoting trade and investment between the U.S. and Africa. It establishes an advisory council to provide recommendations to the President on strengthening commercial engagement. There is a slight tilt towards economic deregulation as it encourages U.S. companies to invest in Africa. It doesn't directly address social issues, immigration, or security, so those scores are neutral. The order delegates authority to the Secretary of Commerce, maintaining a balance of power.",
