    "critique": "This document concerns the disposition of captured flags from the American Civil War. It is a letter from one government official to another, specifically regarding a proposed action by the War Department to return captured flags to both Union and Confederate states. The author of the letter argues that this action is not authorized by law and should not proceed without Congressional approval. Ideological Tilt: The document itself doesn't express a clear ideological stance. It focuses on legal and procedural concerns rather than promoting a particular political viewpoint. Therefore, it is scored as neutral. Immigration Approach: This document has no bearing on immigration policy. Executive Power: The letter argues against an action by the War Department, suggesting a restraint on executive action in the absence of legal authorization. This indicates a limitation on executive power. Federalism: The document does not directly address federalism. National Security vs. Civil Liberties: The document does not directly address national security or civil liberties. Economic Regulation: The document does not address economic regulation. Social Inclusion: The document does not directly address social inclusion. Given the above considerations, the initial scores are as follows:",
