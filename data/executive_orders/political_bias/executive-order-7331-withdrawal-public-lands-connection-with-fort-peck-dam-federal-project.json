    "critique": "This executive order withdraws land for use by the War Department in connection with the Fort Peck Dam and Reservoir project. This seems like a fairly neutral action with regards to ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, and social inclusion. The economic regulation aspect is slightly interventionist as it involves government control over land for a public works project, but it's not a major intervention.",
