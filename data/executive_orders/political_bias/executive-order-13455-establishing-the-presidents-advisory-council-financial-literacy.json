    "critique": "This executive order establishes a council to promote financial literacy. It seems fairly centrist and non-ideological. There's a slight interventionist tilt in that it promotes government involvement in financial education, but it's not heavy-handed. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of those axes should be neutral. The economic regulation aspect is slightly interventionist, but not strongly so.",
