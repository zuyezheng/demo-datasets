    "critique": "This document establishes a commission to investigate the civil and military administration in the military division bordering upon and west of the Mississippi. It grants the commission broad powers to examine witnesses and gather evidence. There is nothing explicitly ideological in this document. It does expand executive power by creating a commission with broad investigative powers. It centralizes power in the federal government by investigating matters within states. It is neutral on national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. It is also neutral on immigration.",
