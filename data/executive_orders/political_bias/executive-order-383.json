    "critique": "This document is a presidential announcement of the death of Edwin M. Stanton and an order to drape the Executive Mansion and Departments in mourning. It expresses respect for Stanton's service as Attorney-General and Secretary of War during a period of national struggle. There is little to no indication of stances on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
