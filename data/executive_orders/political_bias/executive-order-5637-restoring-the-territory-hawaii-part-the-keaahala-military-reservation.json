    "critique": "The document primarily concerns land usage and water rights between the U.S. Federal Government and the Territory of Hawaii. It outlines the restoration of land to its previous status for the use of the Territory of Hawaii, with certain exceptions and reservations for military purposes and water supply. There's no direct discussion of immigration, executive power, or social issues. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
