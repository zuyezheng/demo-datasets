    "critique": "The document is an executive order from 1931 allocating radio frequencies to government stations. It expands executive power during emergencies and defers to federal control over radio communication. There's no direct mention of immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document seems to prioritize security (national communication) over individual liberties.",
