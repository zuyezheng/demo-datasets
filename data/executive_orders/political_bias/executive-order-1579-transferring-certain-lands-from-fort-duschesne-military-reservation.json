    "critique": "This executive order from 1912 transfers land from military control to the Department of Interior, except for a small portion retained for military purposes. It deals with land management and the relationship between the military and the Department of Interior. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power expansion, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The federalism aspect is slightly relevant as it shifts control between federal entities, but it's not a major shift of power between state and federal governments.",
