    "critique": "The document revokes an executive order that established a committee. This action itself doesn't strongly indicate a position on any of the axes. It could be argued that revoking the order slightly reduces executive power, but the effect is minimal. The document does not touch upon immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
