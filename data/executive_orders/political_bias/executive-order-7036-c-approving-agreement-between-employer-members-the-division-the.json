    "critique": "This document pertains to the National Industrial Recovery Act during the Great Depression. It approves an agreement between employers and employees in the construction industry in Travis County, Texas. The act itself was a large intervention in the economy. The agreement seems to be about fair competition, which suggests some regulation. There's no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Given the context of the New Deal, it leans liberal in its approach to economic regulation.",
