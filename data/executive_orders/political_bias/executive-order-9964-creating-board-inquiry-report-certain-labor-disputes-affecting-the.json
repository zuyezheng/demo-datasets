    "critique": "This document establishes a Board of Inquiry to address labor disputes in the maritime industry. It invokes the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 to prevent strikes or lockouts that could imperil national health and safety. The document itself doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation beyond labor relations, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The intervention in labor disputes suggests a moderate level of government intervention in the economy.",
