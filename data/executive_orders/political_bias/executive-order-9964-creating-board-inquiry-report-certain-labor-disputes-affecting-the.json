    "critique": "The document establishes a Board of Inquiry to address labor disputes in the maritime industry. It invokes the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, suggesting a focus on maintaining national health and safety by preventing strikes or lockouts. The document appears neutral in ideological tilt, focusing on resolving labor disputes rather than promoting a specific political agenda. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion, so those aspects are scored as neutral.",
