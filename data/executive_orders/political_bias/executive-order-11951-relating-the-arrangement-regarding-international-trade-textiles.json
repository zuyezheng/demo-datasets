    "critique": "This document is an amendment to a previous executive order, updating references to international trade agreements regarding textiles. It's primarily a technical correction, so it doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation in a broad sense, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The economic regulation axis might have a slight lean, but it's too indirect to score definitively.",
