    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending Schedules A and B of the Civil Service Rules. It details positions that are excepted from competitive examination or may be filled upon noncompetitive examination. Because it deals with the structure and function of the civil service, it does not directly address issues of ideological tilt, immigration, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order delegates authority to the Civil Service Commission to make determinations about positions, and in some cases requires concurrence from department heads, suggesting a cooperative balance rather than strong federal control. The order does not substantially expand executive power, as it primarily clarifies existing rules and delegates authority to the Civil Service Commission. Therefore, the initial scores reflect this assessment.",
