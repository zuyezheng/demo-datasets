    "critique": "This document is an executive order that adjusts the boundaries of Customs Collection Districts. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The adjustment of district boundaries could be seen as a very slight increase in federal control, but it's minimal.",
