    "critique": "This executive order restricts the use of herbicides and riot control agents in war, with specific exceptions. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does limit executive power by requiring presidential approval for certain uses and emphasizes civil liberties by restricting the use of potentially harmful agents. Therefore, the initial scores reflect these considerations.",
