    "critique": "The document pertains to an amendment to civil service rules, specifically Schedule A, Subdivision IV, paragraph 10, which excepts certain positions at the United States Military Academy from competitive examination. The amendment adds a new paragraph (b) to include kitchen helpers and waiters, and head and assistant head waiters when promoted from the position of waiter. This suggests a slight shift towards less stringent hiring practices for these specific roles within the civil service at the Military Academy.",
