    "critique": "This document is an amendment to an executive order that allows funds to be spent in new National Forest Purchase Units. It expands the power of the Secretary of Agriculture with the approval of the National Forest Reservation Commission. This indicates a slight shift towards federal control and government intervention. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. The expansion of the Secretary of Agriculture's power is very limited, so the executive power is neutral.",
