    "critique": "This document is a designation of three international organizations related to fishing as public international organizations, which entitles them to certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores will be neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards international cooperation, which could be seen as a weak form of social inclusion, but I will keep it neutral for now.",
