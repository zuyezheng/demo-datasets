    "critique": "This executive order, issued by President Reagan in 1985, directly addresses the apartheid regime in South Africa. It imposes economic sanctions, including restrictions on loans, computer exports, and nuclear-related materials. It also encourages fair labor practices for US firms operating in South Africa and promotes assistance to businesses owned by disadvantaged South Africans. The order invokes multiple legal authorities, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the United Nations Participation Act. It reflects a stance against racial discrimination and a commitment to human rights, aligning with liberal values. However, it also uses executive power to implement these policies, which could be seen as an expansion of executive authority. The order's focus on international cooperation and human rights aligns with a more liberal foreign policy approach. The economic regulations imposed suggest government intervention, while the emphasis on diversity and inclusion reflects a progressive social agenda.",
