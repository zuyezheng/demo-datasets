    "critique": "This executive order focuses on government-to-government relations with Native American tribes. It emphasizes consultation, collaboration, and respect for tribal self-government and sovereignty. It aims to reduce unfunded mandates and increase flexibility for tribal waivers. It does not touch on immigration, national security, or economic regulation. It promotes tribal sovereignty, which can be seen as a form of decentralization. It also promotes social inclusion by recognizing the unique legal relationship with Indian tribes and supporting their self-determination.",
