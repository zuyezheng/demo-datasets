    "critique": "The document establishes a Cabinet Committee on Economic Policy, advising and assisting the President in developing and coordinating national economic programs and policies. It promotes coordination of federal economic programs and consultation with various groups. There is no mention of immigration, security/liberty, or social inclusion. The order does not explicitly restrain or expand executive authority but rather facilitates advice and coordination. It centralizes economic policy coordination at the federal level. It leans towards government intervention in the economy through the development and coordination of national economic programs and policies.",
