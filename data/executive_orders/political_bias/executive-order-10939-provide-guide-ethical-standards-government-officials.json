    "critique": "This executive order focuses on ethics and conflicts of interest within the federal government. It aims to prevent officials from using their positions for personal gain or engaging in activities that could compromise their impartiality or the public's confidence in the government. There's nothing explicitly liberal or conservative about this; it's more about good governance. It doesn't touch on immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it slightly restricts executive power by setting ethical constraints on high-ranking officials, but the effect is minimal. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
