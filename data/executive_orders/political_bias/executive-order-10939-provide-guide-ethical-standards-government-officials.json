    "critique": "The document focuses on maintaining ethical and moral standards within the Federal Government. It restricts outside activities of officials to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure impartiality. There is no direct discussion of immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are largely neutral, with a slight emphasis on restricting executive power to maintain ethical standards.",
