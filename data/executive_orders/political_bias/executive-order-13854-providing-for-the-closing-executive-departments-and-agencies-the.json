    "critique": "This executive order is a straightforward directive to close federal offices on December 24, 2018. It includes standard clauses about national security exceptions, references to existing laws regarding pay and leave, and disclaimers about creating new rights or affecting existing authorities. There's nothing inherently ideological about this; it's an administrative decision related to a holiday. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. There's no impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is also neutral as it doesn't promote any particular political agenda.",
