    "critique": "This document pertains to appointments within the United States Coronado Exposition Commission. Given it allows appointments without the usual competitive requirements, it could be seen as slightly expanding executive power in a limited context. It doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
