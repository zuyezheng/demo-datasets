    "critique": "This document pertains to amending Rule VIII regarding temporary appointments in the absence of eligible candidates. It addresses how vacancies are filled when no eligible candidates are available and the public interest requires immediate action. It allows for temporary appointments without examination for up to three months, or in emergencies, for up to thirty days. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
