    "critique": "This document is an amendment to a departmental rule, specifically adding positions within the Bureau of Education to the list of places excepted from examination. This suggests a slight expansion of executive power in hiring, but it's minimal. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
