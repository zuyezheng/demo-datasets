    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that waives civil service requirements for Dr. John Bruce Arnold to be appointed as acting assistant surgeon in the United States Public Health Service. It cites Dr. Arnold's prior service abroad and the curtailment of force as reasons for the waiver. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis with a potential score is executive power, as the order waives civil service rules, which could be seen as a slight expansion of executive authority. However, it is a specific case and seems justified by the circumstances.",
