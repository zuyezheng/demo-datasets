    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the appointment of Dr. John Bruce Arnold to the United States Public Health Service. It appears to be a specific case and doesn't make broad statements about political ideologies. The order waives civil service requirements for this particular appointment due to Dr. Arnold's prior service abroad. Therefore, most of the axes would be neutral, with a slight lean towards executive power expansion due to the waiver.",
