    "critique": "This document is an executive order that withdraws public land in Alaska for use by the War Department for military purposes. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that reserving land for military use slightly expands executive power and federal control, and leans towards national security, but these are minor effects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
