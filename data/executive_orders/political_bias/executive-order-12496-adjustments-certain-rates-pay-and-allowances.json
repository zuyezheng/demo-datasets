    "critique": "This document adjusts the rates of basic pay and salaries for various government employees, including those in the General Schedule, Foreign Service, Senior Executive Service, and Uniformed Services. It also adjusts the salaries for the Vice President, Congress, and the Judiciary. There is nothing particularly ideological about this, so it should be close to zero on the ideological tilt. It does not deal with immigration at all. It could be argued that adjusting the pay of the Executive branch expands executive power, but I think that is a stretch. It is more of an administrative action. It does not seem to shift power between the state and federal governments. It does not deal with national security or civil liberties. It could be argued that adjusting pay is a form of economic intervention, but I think that is also a stretch. It does not deal with social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be zero.",
