    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending a previous executive order regarding allowances for government personnel on foreign duty. It primarily concerns the delegation of authority to the Secretary of State and references specific public laws. Given the subject matter, the document has very little bearing on ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis with a potential score is executive power, but even here, the amendment seems to be a technical adjustment rather than a significant expansion or restriction of executive authority.",
