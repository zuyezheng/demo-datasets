    "critique": "This executive order primarily deals with the internal organization and delegation of functions within the Department of State and related agencies. It establishes and defines the roles of the Board of the Foreign Service and the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service. There's no direct impact on immigration, civil liberties, or economic regulation. The order delegates authority from the President to the Secretary of State and other officials, but it doesn't drastically expand executive power beyond the existing framework. It maintains existing authorities and arrangements. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
