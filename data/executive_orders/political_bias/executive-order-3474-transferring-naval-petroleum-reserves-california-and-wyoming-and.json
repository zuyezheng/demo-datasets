It outlines the responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior and emphasizes cooperation with the Secretary of the Navy. The document does not explicitly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial and revised scores are set to neutral for all axes.",
