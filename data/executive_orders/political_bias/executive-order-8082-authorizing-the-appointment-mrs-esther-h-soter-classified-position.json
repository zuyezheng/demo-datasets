    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1939 allowing Mrs. Esther H. Soter to be appointed to a position in the Federal Trade Commission without meeting civil service requirements. The rationale is that she is the widow of a former employee who died and left her and her three children without adequate support. This appears to be a compassionate measure during a time when social safety nets were less developed. It is difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt based on this single action. It doesn't directly relate to immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a modern context. However, one could argue it leans slightly towards social inclusion by providing support to a widow and her children, although this is a very specific case. It could also be seen as a slight intervention in economic regulation, as it circumvents standard hiring practices.",
