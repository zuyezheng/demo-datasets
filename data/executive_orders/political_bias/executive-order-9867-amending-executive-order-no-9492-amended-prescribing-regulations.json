It extends the time period mentioned in paragraph 2(c) from \"two years and eight months\" to \"two years and ten months.\" There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation changes, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
