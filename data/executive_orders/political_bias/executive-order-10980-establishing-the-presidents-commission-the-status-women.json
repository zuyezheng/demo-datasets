    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to address the status of women. It aims to overcome discrimination and promote women's opportunities while also considering their roles as wives and mothers. It seems to lean slightly liberal due to its focus on women's rights and non-discrimination, but it also acknowledges traditional roles. Immigration is not addressed. It expands executive power by creating a commission. It involves the federal government in employment policies and social services. It promotes social inclusion by addressing gender discrimination.",
