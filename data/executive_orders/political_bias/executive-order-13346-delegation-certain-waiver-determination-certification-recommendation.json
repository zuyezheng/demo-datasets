    "critique": "This executive order primarily delegates presidential functions related to waivers, determinations, certifications, recommendations, and reports to the Congress to the Secretary of State and the United States Trade Representative. It also amends previous executive orders. There's nothing inherently ideological about delegating these functions. It touches upon trade, foreign affairs, and national security, but does not express a clear bias in any of these areas. The order aims to improve internal management of the executive branch. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral.",
