    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1937 exempting a specific person from mandatory retirement. It is a very specific action with limited scope. Therefore, most of the axes should be close to neutral. The executive power axis might be slightly positive, as it is an executive order, but it is also explicitly authorized by law, so it's not a major expansion.",
