    "critique": "This document is an executive order that allows the Select Committee on Crime to inspect income tax returns from 1960-1970. It is related to an investigation of crime in the United States. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt. It does not relate to immigration. It could be argued that allowing access to tax returns expands executive power, but it is also in service of a congressional investigation, so I will mark it as neutral. It does not directly relate to federalism. It could be argued that allowing access to tax returns infringes on civil liberties, but it is also in service of investigating crime, so I will mark it as neutral. It does not directly relate to economic regulation. It does not directly relate to social inclusion.",
