    "critique": "This document primarily concerns adjustments to retirement systems for the Foreign Service and the CIA to align them with the Civil Service Retirement System. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The order itself doesn't expand executive power, but rather implements existing laws, so it should be scored as neutral in that regard as well.",
