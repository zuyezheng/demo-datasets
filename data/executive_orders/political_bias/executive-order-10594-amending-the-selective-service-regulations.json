    "critique": "This document primarily concerns amendments to the Selective Service Regulations, focusing on administrative procedures, registration requirements, and classification criteria for military service. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, or social inclusion. The changes appear to be technical adjustments to the existing system. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document centralizes control with the federal government, so it should have a slightly positive score for Federalism. The document also focuses on national security, so it should have a slightly positive score for National Security vs. Civil Liberties.",
