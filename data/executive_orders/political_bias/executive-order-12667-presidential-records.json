    "critique": "This executive order outlines procedures for asserting executive privilege over presidential records. It aims to balance transparency (through the Presidential Records Act) with the need to protect national security and executive branch deliberations. The order itself doesn't inherently lean strongly on any particular ideological axis. It establishes a process involving the Archivist, Attorney General, Counsel to the President, and both incumbent and former Presidents. The order seems to maintain a balance between different branches and individuals. It does not obviously favor one political ideology over another. It does not deal with immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does touch on national security versus civil liberties, but in a balanced way. It also touches on executive power, but it seems to create a process rather than expand power.",
