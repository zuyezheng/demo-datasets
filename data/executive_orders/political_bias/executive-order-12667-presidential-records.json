    "critique": "This document outlines procedures for asserting Executive privilege regarding Presidential records. It aims to balance transparency with the need to protect national security and executive branch deliberations. There's a slight tilt towards expanding executive power, as it reinforces the ability of both incumbent and former presidents to invoke Executive privilege. However, it also includes provisions for judicial review and consultation with various agencies, suggesting a degree of restraint.",
