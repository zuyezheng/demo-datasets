    "critique": "This document is an executive order from Richard Nixon regarding property transfers to the Postal Service. It delegates authority to the Administrator of General Services and outlines reimbursement procedures for property transfers. There is nothing explicitly ideological in this document. It seems to be an administrative action related to the Postal Reorganization Act. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. There's a slight increase in executive power due to the delegation of authority, but it's not a significant expansion.",
