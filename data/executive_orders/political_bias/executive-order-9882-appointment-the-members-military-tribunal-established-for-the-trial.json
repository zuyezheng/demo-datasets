    "critique": "This document establishes a military tribunal in post-war Germany to try major war criminals. It is difficult to assess its position on the traditional left-right political spectrum. It does not directly address immigration. It expands executive power by establishing military tribunals. It does not directly address federalism. It prioritizes national security. It does not directly address economic regulation. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
