    "critique": "This document is a transfer of land from the US military to the Territory of Hawaii for use as a water reservoir. It is a very specific action with limited scope and does not touch on broad political issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism axis leans slightly towards state control as it gives land to the territory of Hawaii.",
