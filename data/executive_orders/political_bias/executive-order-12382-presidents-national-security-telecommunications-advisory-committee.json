    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee. It aims to gather advice from the telecommunications industry to improve national security telecommunications. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It does expand executive power by creating a committee to advise the President, and it leans towards federal control by centralizing national security telecommunications policy. It also prioritizes national security. There is no clear indication of social inclusion or exclusion.",
