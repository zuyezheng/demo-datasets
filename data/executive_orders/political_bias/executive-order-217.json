    "critique": "This document is a military order announcing the death and funeral arrangements for General Sherman. It primarily concerns military protocols and expressions of national mourning. There is no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, executive power grabs, federalism concerns, or clashes between national security and civil liberties. The order doesn't touch upon economic regulation or social inclusion matters either. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
