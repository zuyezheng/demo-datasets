    "critique": "This document primarily deals with the technical adjustments to pay schedules and judicial salaries. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation in a broad sense, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The adjustments to judicial salaries could be seen as a very slight expansion of federal power, but it's minimal.",
