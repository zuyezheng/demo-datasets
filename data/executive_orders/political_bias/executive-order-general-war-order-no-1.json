    "critique": "This is an order from the President during the Civil War. It directs the Union forces to advance on the Confederacy. It doesn't directly address economic regulation, immigration, or social inclusion. It does expand executive power, as it is a direct order to the military. It also centralizes power in the federal government, as it is a federal order to federal forces. It prioritizes national security, as it is an order to suppress an insurrection. It is difficult to place on the traditional left-right spectrum, but given the context of the Civil War, it is likely to be seen as conservative in its aim to preserve the existing order (the Union).",
