    "critique": "This document establishes an experimental program within the Executive Exchange Program, allowing government agencies to accept voluntary services from private sector participants. It seems fairly neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. The program has limits on the number of participants and duration, and it specifies that participation should not displace government employees. It also clarifies the participant's status as an employee for some purposes but not for others (e.g., pay, leave, retirement).",
