    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between a railway company and its employees. It seems to be a fairly neutral intervention to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. It doesn't strongly lean in any particular ideological direction, nor does it obviously affect immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has a moderate impact on economic regulation.",
