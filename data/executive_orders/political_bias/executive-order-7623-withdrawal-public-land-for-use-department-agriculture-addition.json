    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1937 that withdraws land for agricultural use. It doesn't directly address any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The federal government is taking control of land, so this slightly increases federal power.",
