    "critique": "This document is a eulogy for Andrew Jackson, issued as an executive order and a general order to the military. It expresses respect and mourning for a former president. It does not contain policy prescriptions or address current political issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The exception might be executive power, which could be seen as slightly expanded by using an executive order for a ceremonial purpose, though this is a very minor expansion.",
