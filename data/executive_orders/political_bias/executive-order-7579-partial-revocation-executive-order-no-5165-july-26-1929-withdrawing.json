It's a technical correction related to land management and doesn't directly address any of the core political bias axes. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's no indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power expansion or restriction (it's simply revoking a previous order), federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion matters.",
