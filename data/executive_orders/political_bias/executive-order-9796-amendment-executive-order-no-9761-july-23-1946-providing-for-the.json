    "critique": "This document is a minor amendment to an existing executive order concerning the handling of flags, standards, or colors taken by the Marine Corps. It directs that these items be deposited in the United States Marine Corps Museum at Quantico, Virginia, under the care of the Curator thereof, unless otherwise directed by the Secretary of the Navy. Given the subject matter, the document has minimal implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
