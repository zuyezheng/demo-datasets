    "critique": "This document establishes the Bob Hope American Patriot Award. It aims to encourage love of country, service to the people, and support for the Armed Forces. It recognizes Bob Hope's service to the troops. There is little here to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any meaningful way. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
