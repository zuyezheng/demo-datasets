    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the transfer of land in the Virgin Islands from the Department of Interior to the Department of Navy for the construction of aviation facilities. It is an executive order from 1936. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It does not directly address immigration. It could be argued that transferring land to the Navy expands executive power, but it is a fairly minor action. It shifts control within the federal government, so it is hard to say if it impacts federalism. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It involves government control of land, but it is not economic regulation in the traditional sense. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
