    "critique": "This document pertains to the National Industrial Recovery Act, which is a New Deal program. Therefore, it likely has a liberal ideological tilt and favors government intervention in the economy. It does not seem to directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Therefore, those axes should be scored as neutral.",
