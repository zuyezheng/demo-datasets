    "critique": "This document is a short executive order about reinstating a woman, Mrs. Marguerite Barrett, to her position in the Treasury Department. It notes her previous service and her family situation (being a single mother with three children). The order is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury. There is little to analyze in terms of political bias. It seems like a compassionate decision to reinstate someone who had previously worked in public service and is now in a difficult situation. It is difficult to assign meaningful scores to the axes given the limited scope and nature of the document.",
