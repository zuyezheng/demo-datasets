    "critique": "This document is an executive order that designates an acting judge for the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It is primarily an administrative action. The order could be seen as slightly expanding executive power by allowing the president to designate an acting judge, but it is a very minor expansion. It also has a slight impact on federalism, as it involves the federal government's role in Puerto Rico. There is no impact on national security vs. civil liberties.",
