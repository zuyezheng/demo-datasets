    "critique": "This executive order focuses on ethics in government and aims to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure public trust. It doesn't directly address issues related to the traditional left-right spectrum, immigration, or federalism. It could be argued that promoting ethical conduct and preventing corruption aligns with good governance principles that both liberals and conservatives can support. The order delegates authority to agency heads and the Counsel to the President, but this seems more about efficient management than a significant expansion of executive power. It emphasizes accountability and adherence to laws, which could be seen as a balanced approach between security and liberty. The order promotes equal opportunity, which aligns with social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores reflect a moderate stance on most axes.",
