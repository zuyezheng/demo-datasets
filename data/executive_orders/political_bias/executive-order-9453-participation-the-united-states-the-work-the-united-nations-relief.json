    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. It seems to be an administrative action to facilitate US participation. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt. Immigration is not directly addressed. Executive power is delegated within the executive branch, so it's hard to say if it expands or restricts it significantly. Federalism isn't really relevant here. National security vs. civil liberties isn't a factor. Economic regulation isn't directly involved, though it does deal with expenditure of funds. Social inclusion isn't a primary focus.",
