It cites the act of June 25, 1910, as amended by the act of August 24, 1912, and the act of May 29, 1908. There is nothing to suggest any ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power grab, federalism shift, national security concern, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspect. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
