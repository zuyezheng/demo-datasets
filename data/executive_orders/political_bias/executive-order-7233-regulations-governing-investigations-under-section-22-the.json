    "critique": "This document outlines regulations for investigations under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. It delegates authority to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Tariff Commission to conduct investigations and make recommendations to the President. There's a moderate increase in executive power due to the delegation of investigative authority. The document also leans towards economic intervention by regulating agricultural adjustments. There is no direct impact on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. Federalism is slightly strengthened as the federal government takes control of agricultural adjustments.",
