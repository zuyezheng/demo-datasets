    "critique": "This document revokes part of an order creating a power-site reserve. It's a simple revocation related to land use. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power grab, federalism shift, security vs. liberty concerns, social inclusion matters. The only axis with a potential impact is economic regulation, where revoking the reserve could be seen as a move towards deregulation, but it's very minor. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
