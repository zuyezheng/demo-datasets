    "critique": "This document pertains to the expansion of the Puyallup Reservation in 1873. Given the historical context, several factors influence the scoring. Ideologically, the document reflects a policy of dealing with Native American tribes through reservations, which, while intended to provide land, also served as a tool for control and assimilation. Immigration is not directly addressed, but the concept of reservations implicitly restricts the movement and autonomy of Native populations. Executive power is somewhat expanded as the President is enacting this change via executive order. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is making decisions about land use within a territory. National security vs. civil liberties is a complex issue here; while the reservation might be seen as providing some security for the tribe, it also infringes on their broader liberties. Economic regulation isn't a primary factor, but the establishment of a reservation does impact land use and resource access. Social inclusion is negatively impacted as the document enforces a separation between Native Americans and the broader society.",
