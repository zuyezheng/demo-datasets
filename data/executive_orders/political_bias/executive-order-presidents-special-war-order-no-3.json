    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding military command structure during the Civil War. It primarily deals with the organization of military departments and reporting lines. There is little to no information related to ideological tilt, immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order centralizes command by requiring direct reporting to the Secretary of War, suggesting a strengthening of federal control. It also adjusts executive power by reassigning command responsibilities.",
