    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding land use in Idaho. It revokes a previous order and withdraws land for use as a rifle range by a local gun club, under the supervision of the War Department. There is no clear ideological tilt, immigration policy, or impact on social inclusion. It has a slight impact on federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, and economic regulation. Executive power is neutral as it is a standard land management decision.",
