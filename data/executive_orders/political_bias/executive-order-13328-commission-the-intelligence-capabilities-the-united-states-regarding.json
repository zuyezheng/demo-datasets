    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to assess the intelligence capabilities of the United States regarding weapons of mass destruction. It is a response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the ongoing threat of terrorist activity. The order does not explicitly promote any particular ideology, but it does reflect a concern for national security. It also expands executive power by creating a commission within the Executive Office of the President. The order does not address immigration, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes are neutral.",
