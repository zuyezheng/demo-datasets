    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1941 that exempts an employee from compulsory retirement for one year. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of this document, as it is a simple administrative action. It does not directly address immigration, but it concerns an employee of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by allowing the president to make exceptions to retirement rules, but it is a minor expansion. It does not directly relate to federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral.",
