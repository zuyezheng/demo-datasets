    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending the Manual for Courts-Martial. It primarily concerns military justice and procedural updates. There's no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or economic regulation. The changes don't seem to expand executive power significantly, as they are within the existing framework of military law. The order doesn't directly impact federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
