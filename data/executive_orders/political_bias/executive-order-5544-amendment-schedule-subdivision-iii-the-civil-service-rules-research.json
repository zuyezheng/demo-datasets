    "critique": "The document discusses an amendment to Schedule A, Subdivision III of positions excepted from examination under civil service rules. It adds a new paragraph, numbered 17, concerning Public Health Service research associates holding fellowships for a fixed term in the National Institute of Health under the act approved May 26, 1930. The qualifications for such research associates are subject to approval by the commission. The exception is proposed by the Treasury Department and concurred in by the commission because of the unusual qualifications required and the extraordinary character of the work.",
