    "critique": "This document is an executive order that temporarily suspends professional examination requirements for promotions in the Medical, Dental, and Veterinary Corps of the Regular Army. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The temporary suspension could be seen as a very slight increase in executive flexibility, but it's minimal.",
