    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending the Manual for Courts-Martial for the United States Army. It pertains to the admissibility of evidence in courts-martial, specifically regarding certificates issued by The Adjutant General. The order allows such certificates to be considered prima facie evidence, even if the source of the information is not divulged due to public policy concerns. This could potentially limit the ability of the accused to challenge the evidence against them.\n\n1.  Ideological Tilt: 0. The document does not directly address typical left-right political issues. It is more about legal procedure within the military.\n2.  Immigration Approach: 0. The document has no bearing on immigration.\n3.  Executive Power: 1. The order expands executive power slightly by giving more weight to certifications from the Adjutant General, an executive branch official, in military courts.\n4.  Federalism: 0. The document does not significantly impact the balance of power between the federal government and the states.\n5.  National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 1.

Economic Regulation: 0. The document has no impact on economic regulation.\n7.  Social Inclusion: 0. The document does not address social inclusion issues.",
