    "critique": "This document establishes a wildlife refuge and outlines prohibited activities within its boundaries. It aims to protect wild animals, birds, and natural resources. There's a focus on conservation and preventing activities like hunting, trapping, and destruction of natural growth. The document also mentions penalties for violating these regulations. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. However, there is a slight increase in federal power due to the establishment of a federal reserve.",
