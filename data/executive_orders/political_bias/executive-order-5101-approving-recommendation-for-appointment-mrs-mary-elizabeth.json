    "critique": "This document is a short executive order that allows Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Porterfield to be appointed as an operative in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing of the Treasury Department without regard to civil service rules. This is justified by the Secretary of the Treasury because Mrs. Porterfield is the widow of Mr. James Porterfield, who served as a plate printer in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing for more than sixteen years and died leaving his widow and two daughters without sufficient means of support. The document does not seem to have any ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties implications, economic regulation implications, or social inclusion implications. It seems to be a one-off case based on specific circumstances.",
