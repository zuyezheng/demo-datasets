    "critique": "This executive order primarily deals with the classification of positions within the National Training School for Boys under civil service rules. It doesn't directly address issues like immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Its main focus is on standardizing hiring practices within this institution. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The ideological tilt is also neutral as it doesn't promote any specific political ideology.",
