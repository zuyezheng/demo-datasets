    "critique": "This document is an executive order that withdraws public lands in Utah from settlement, location, sale, or entry, pending a determination on adding them to Zion National Park. It cites the authority of a 1910 act of Congress. There's no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, or civil liberties concerns. It does expand federal control over land use within Utah, which relates to federalism. There's a slight intervention in economic activity by restricting land use, and a potential, very slight, move towards social inclusion by potentially expanding a national park for public enjoyment. There's no indication of executive power expansion beyond the scope of the cited act.",
