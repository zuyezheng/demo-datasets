    "critique": "This document concerns the revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in Wyoming after a resurvey. Given the subject matter, most axes are not applicable. The order itself doesn't inherently lean liberal or conservative. It doesn't deal with immigration, executive power in a broad sense, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that might be relevant is federalism, as it concerns the management of federal lands. However, the revocation seems to be a technical adjustment following a resurvey, rather than a substantive shift in control between the federal government and the state of Wyoming.",
