    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the transfer of the Review Committee on Deferment of Government Employees to the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion. It is a wartime measure from 1946, so it is difficult to assess its ideological tilt in the traditional sense. It centralizes power in the executive branch and the federal government, which is typical of wartime measures. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes are neutral.",
