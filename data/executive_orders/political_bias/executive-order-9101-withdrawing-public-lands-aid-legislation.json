    "critique": "This document pertains to the temporary withdrawal of public lands in California from settlement, location, sale, or entry, in aid of legislation. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The action itself is a relatively minor administrative action.",
