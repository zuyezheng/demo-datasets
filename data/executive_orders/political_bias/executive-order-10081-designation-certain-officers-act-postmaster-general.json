    "critique": "This document is an executive order that specifies the line of succession for the office of Postmaster General in the event of the Postmaster General's absence or sickness. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order delegates authority within the executive branch, but it does not expand executive power in a significant way. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0).",
