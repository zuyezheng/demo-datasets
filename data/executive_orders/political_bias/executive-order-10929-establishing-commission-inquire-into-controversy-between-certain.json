    "critique": "This executive order establishes a presidential commission to address a labor dispute. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by creating a commission and allocating funds, but it also involves multiple parties (carriers, employees) in the process. It seems to favor federal involvement in resolving a labor dispute, suggesting a slight leaning towards federalism. It doesn't directly impact national security or civil liberties. It involves government intervention in an economic matter (labor dispute), but not in a way that heavily regulates the economy. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
