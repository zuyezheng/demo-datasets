    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1937 exempting a specific individual from mandatory retirement. It's a fairly narrow action. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on the modern left-right spectrum. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in general (though it uses it in a limited way), federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that seems relevant is executive power, and even there, it's a limited, specific exemption, so I'll mark it as slightly expanding executive power, but not significantly.",
