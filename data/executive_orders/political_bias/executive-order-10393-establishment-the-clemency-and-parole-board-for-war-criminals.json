    "critique": "This executive order establishes a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt as it focuses on a specific legal and administrative matter related to war crimes tribunals. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order delegates authority to the board and the President, but it is not a significant expansion of executive power. It involves multiple departments, suggesting a cooperative balance rather than strong federal control. Therefore, most axes are neutral.",
