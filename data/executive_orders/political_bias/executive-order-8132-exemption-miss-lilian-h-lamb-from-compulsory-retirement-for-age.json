    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts a specific individual from mandatory retirement. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt as it pertains to a specific case. There's no bearing on immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by making an exception to a general rule, but it's a very minor expansion.",
