    "critique": "This document establishes the Air Medal for meritorious achievement during aerial flight. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The primary focus is on military honors and recognition. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The national security vs. civil liberties axis is slightly tilted towards national security due to its military context, but not significantly.",
