    "critique": "This document is an executive order approving a code of fair competition for a specific manufacturing industry, pursuant to the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933. \n\nIdeological Tilt: The NIRA was a New Deal program, which is generally considered liberal due to its interventionist approach to the economy. Therefore, a positive score is appropriate.\nImmigration Approach: This document does not address immigration, so it should be neutral.\nExecutive Power: Approving a code of fair competition expands executive power, as it involves the executive branch in regulating industry. Therefore, a positive score is appropriate.\nFederalism: The NIRA increased the power of the federal government over the states, so a positive score is appropriate.\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: This document does not directly address national security or civil liberties, so it should be neutral.\nEconomic Regulation: This document approves a code of fair competition, which implies government intervention in the economy. Therefore, a positive score is appropriate.\nSocial Inclusion: This document does not address social inclusion, so it should be neutral.",
