    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order, pending a resurvey. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism aspect could be argued as leaning slightly towards federal control, as it's a federal action on land, but it's a very weak signal.",
