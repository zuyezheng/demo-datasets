    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order, pending a resurvey. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, or national security. It has a slight impact on economic regulation by restricting land use temporarily. It doesn't address social inclusion. Federalism is implicated as it involves federal land. Therefore, the initial scores are mostly neutral, with slight adjustments for federalism and economic regulation.",
