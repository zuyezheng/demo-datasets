    "critique": "This executive order establishes a reservation for the Jicarilla Apache Indians. This action suggests a degree of social inclusion, acknowledging the rights and needs of a specific Native American tribe. It also involves federal control over land use, setting aside territory within New Mexico. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power dynamics, national security concerns, or economic regulation. Therefore, the primary areas to score are federalism and social inclusion.",
