    "critique": "This executive order establishes a merit system for hiring attorneys in the civil service. It creates a Board of Legal Examiners to oversee recruitment, selection, and promotion of attorneys. The order also includes provisions for veterans' preference and apportionment of positions among states based on population. It appears to be a fairly neutral document focused on improving the civil service. There is a slight tilt towards federalism as it centralizes the hiring process within a federal board. There is also a slight tilt towards conformity as it emphasizes a merit system and standardized procedures.",
