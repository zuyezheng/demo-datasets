    "critique": "This executive order establishes the National Science and Technology Council. It aims to coordinate science and technology policymaking across the Federal Government and ensure alignment with the President's goals. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by centralizing science and technology policy within the executive branch, but it's a fairly moderate expansion. It centralizes authority at the federal level. It doesn't directly impact national security vs. civil liberties. It doesn't directly regulate the economy. It doesn't directly address social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
