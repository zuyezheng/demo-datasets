    "critique": "This document is an executive order that returns land from the US government to the Territory of Hawaii. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt as it is primarily an administrative action. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does shift control from the federal government to the Territory of Hawaii, indicating a move towards state control.",
