    "critique": "This document is a straightforward administrative order regarding a customs port of entry. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It has a very slight impact on federalism, as it adjusts a federal designation, but the impact is minimal. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards federal control.",
