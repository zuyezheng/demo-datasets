    "critique": "This document is a routine executive order regarding the line of succession within the Department of Labor. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it arguably touches upon is executive power, but even there, it's simply a matter of internal organization and doesn't expand the power of the executive branch in any meaningful way. Therefore, all axes should be scored as neutral.",
