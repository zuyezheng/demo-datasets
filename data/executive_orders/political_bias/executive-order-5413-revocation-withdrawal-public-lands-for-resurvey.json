    "critique": "This document concerns the revocation of an executive order withdrawing public lands in Wyoming and opening them for homesteading, first to ex-service men and then to the general public. It does not touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, or national security. It has a slight tilt towards state control as it deals with land within Wyoming. It also has a slight tilt towards deregulation as it opens up land for private use. Finally, it is neutral on social inclusion.",
