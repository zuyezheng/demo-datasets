    "critique": "This document is an executive order that increases the membership of the President's Commission on Housing. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The increase in the size of the commission could be seen as a very slight expansion of executive power, but it's minimal.",
