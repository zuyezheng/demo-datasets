    "critique": "This document is an executive order that abolishes Fort Pierce, Florida, as a customs port of entry. It is a very specific and narrow action. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power shift, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation impact, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0).",
