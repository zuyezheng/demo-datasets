    "critique": "This document approves a \"Code of Fair Competition for the Set Up Paper Box Industry\" under the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933. This act was a key component of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, which aimed to combat the Great Depression through government intervention in the economy. The document itself doesn't directly address social issues, immigration, or civil liberties. However, its core function is economic regulation. The NIRA was later deemed unconstitutional, but at the time, it represented a significant expansion of federal power over the economy. Therefore, the ideological tilt is moderately liberal due to the interventionist approach. Immigration is not addressed, so it is neutral. Executive power is expanded as the president approves the code. Federalism is expanded as the federal government is regulating an industry. National security is not addressed, so it is neutral. Economic regulation is heavy. Social inclusion is not addressed, so it is neutral.",
