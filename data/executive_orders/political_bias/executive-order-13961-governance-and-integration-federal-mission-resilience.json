It establishes committees and assigns responsibilities to various agencies to ensure the preservation of National Essential Functions (NEFs) under all conditions. There is a strong emphasis on preparedness, risk management, and coordination among executive departments. The order does not directly address immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It centralizes authority within the executive branch to ensure continuity of government.",
