    "critique": "This document primarily concerns land management and the expansion of national forests. It doesn't directly address typical ideological concerns, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism axis leans slightly towards federal control as it consolidates land under federal management.",
