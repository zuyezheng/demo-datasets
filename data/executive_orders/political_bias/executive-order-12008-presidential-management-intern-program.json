    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Presidential Management Intern Program. It aims to attract individuals with management potential to federal service. It includes provisions for affirmative action and equal employment opportunity. There is nothing about immigration or national security. It seems to expand federal power slightly by creating a federal program. It doesn't seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It promotes diversity through affirmative action.",
