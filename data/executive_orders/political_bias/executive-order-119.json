    "critique": "This document concerns the allocation of funds to Puerto Rico for public improvements. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The federalism aspect is present, as it involves the federal government allocating funds to a territory, but it seems to be a fairly standard procedure. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
