    "critique": "This is an executive order that extends the exemption of Arthur H. Chase, a senior ordnance engineer, from compulsory retirement for another year. It cites the public interest and legal authority for the action. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis with a potential score is executive power, as it involves the President making a decision about an individual's employment, but it is a very minor action.",
