    "critique": "This document is an executive order by President Eisenhower creating a board to investigate disputes between railway carriers and their employees. The disputes concern vacation and holiday rules, health and welfare plans, and wages. The order invokes the Railway Labor Act and aims to prevent interruptions to interstate commerce. It seems to be a fairly neutral intervention to resolve a labor dispute.",
