    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1936 regarding the retirement age of a government employee. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt as it pertains to a specific individual and a specific situation. Immigration is not addressed. The order expands executive power by exempting an individual from mandatory retirement. Federalism is not directly addressed, but the order pertains to a federal employee. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly relevant. Economic regulation is not directly relevant. Social inclusion is not directly relevant.",
