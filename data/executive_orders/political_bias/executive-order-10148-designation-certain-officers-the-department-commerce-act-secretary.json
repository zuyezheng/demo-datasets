    "critique": "This document is a routine executive order specifying the line of succession within the Department of Commerce. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It slightly expands executive power by clarifying the line of succession, but this is a minimal impact.",
