    "critique": "This executive order simply amends a previous one to increase the number of members on the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. It includes standard clauses about not impairing existing authority and being subject to appropriations. There's nothing inherently ideological, related to immigration, or indicative of a shift in federalism or national security. It doesn't touch on economic regulation or social inclusion. The change to the council's size could be seen as a very slight expansion of executive resources, but it's minimal.",
