    "critique": "This document is an authorization for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe regulations for the acceptance of medals and ribbons offered by multilateral organizations (other than the UN) to members of the Armed Forces. It requires concurrence of the Secretary of State for determining the justification of accepting medals/ribbons. This seems fairly neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, all scores are initialized to 0.",
