    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1935 that allows Mrs. Myrtle K. Brockway to be appointed to a clerical position in the General Accounting Office without compliance with civil service rules. The justification is that she is the widow of a veteran. This is a relatively narrow action. \n\n1.  Ideological Tilt: This is hard to place on the modern left-right spectrum. It could be seen as a form of patronage, which might be considered conservative in some contexts, but also as support for a veteran's family, which could be seen as liberal. I'll score it as slightly conservative.\n2.  Immigration Approach: This document has nothing to do with immigration.\n3.  Executive Power: This is a specific exception to civil service rules, so it slightly expands executive power, but in a very limited way.\n4.  Federalism: This doesn't really affect the balance of power between the federal government and the states.\n5.  National Security vs. Civil Liberties: This doesn't directly impact national security or civil liberties, though it could be argued that circumventing civil service rules slightly weakens the meritocratic system.\n6.  Economic Regulation: This doesn't directly regulate the economy, but it does create an exception to hiring rules, which could be seen as a slight intervention.\n7.  Social Inclusion: This could be seen as favoring a specific group (veterans' families) over others, so it's slightly against social inclusion in the broadest sense.\n\nRevised Scores:\nI will revise the ideological tilt to be more neutral, as it's hard to place on the modern spectrum. I will also reduce the executive power score, as the impact is very limited.",
