    "critique": "This executive order withdraws land for use as a target range by the War Department. It doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, or social inclusion. It touches on federalism by reserving land for federal use, and security by allocating land for military purposes. Economic regulation is not a primary focus, but the withdrawal could have minor economic impacts.",
