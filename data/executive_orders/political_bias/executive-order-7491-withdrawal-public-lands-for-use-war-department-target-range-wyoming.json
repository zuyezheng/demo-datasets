    "critique": "This executive order withdraws land for use as a War Department target range. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, or social inclusion. It expands executive power by withdrawing land, and it leans towards federal primacy by reserving land for federal use. It prioritizes national security by providing a target range for the War Department. It doesn't directly regulate the economy.",
