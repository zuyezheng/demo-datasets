    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1929 that appoints a person to a position without regard to civil service rules. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt, immigration approach, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion based on this document alone, so I will assign a neutral score of 0 for these axes. The document seems to expand executive power by bypassing civil service rules, so I will assign a score of 2 for this axis. The document relates to a position in the Philippines, which might suggest a slight increase in federal control, so I will assign a score of 1 for federalism.",
