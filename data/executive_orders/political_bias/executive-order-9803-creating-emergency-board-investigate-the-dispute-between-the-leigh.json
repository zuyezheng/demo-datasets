    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between a railway company and its employees. It seems to be a fairly neutral intervention to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. It doesn't strongly lean in any particular ideological direction. It is hard to judge the degree of economic regulation without more context, but the intervention seems moderate. It doesn't directly address social inclusion or immigration. It is hard to judge the degree of federalism without more context, but it seems moderate. It is hard to judge the degree of executive power without more context, but it seems moderate. It is hard to judge the degree of security vs liberty without more context, but it seems moderate.",
