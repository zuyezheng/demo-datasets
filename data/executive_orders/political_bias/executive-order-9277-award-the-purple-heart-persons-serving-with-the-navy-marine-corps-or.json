    "critique": "This executive order expands the scope of the Purple Heart to include Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard personnel, mirroring existing Army regulations. It addresses military awards and doesn't directly relate to ideological divides, immigration, executive power grabs, federalism, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. The expansion to other military branches could be seen as a slight centralizing of military honors, but it's minimal.",
