    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous order regarding the National Security Medal. It broadens the criteria for awarding the medal and clarifies the recommendation process. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on federalism. It slightly expands executive power by centralizing the award process through the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council. It emphasizes national security by focusing on achievements in that field. It has a neutral impact on economic regulation and social inclusion.",
