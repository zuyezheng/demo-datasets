    "critique": "This executive order establishes a committee to study and make recommendations on personnel management within the government. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order itself doesn't expand executive power, but the act of creating a committee could be seen as a slight expansion of administrative overhead.",
