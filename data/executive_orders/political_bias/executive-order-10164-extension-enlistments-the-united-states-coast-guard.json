    "critique": "This document extends enlistments in the Coast Guard. It does not obviously relate to ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It arguably expands executive power slightly, but only in a very limited and specific way related to military enlistments during a time of war (Korean War).",
