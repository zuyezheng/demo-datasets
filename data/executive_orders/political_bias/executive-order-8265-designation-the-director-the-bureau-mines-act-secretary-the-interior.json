Finch to perform the duties of various positions within the Department of Interior during the absence or sickness of those individuals. It seems to be an administrative action. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power changes, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
