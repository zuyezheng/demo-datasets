    "critique": "This document establishes the order of succession within the Environmental Protection Agency. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It primarily concerns the internal operations of the EPA and the line of succession in case of vacancies. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The executive power axis is slightly negative as it reaffirms existing laws and doesn't expand executive authority beyond established frameworks. The federalism axis is neutral as it deals with a federal agency. The economic regulation axis is also neutral, as the order of succession doesn't impact economic policies directly. Similarly, social inclusion remains neutral.",
