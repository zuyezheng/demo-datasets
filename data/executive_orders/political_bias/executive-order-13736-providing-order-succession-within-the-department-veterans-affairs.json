    "critique": "This executive order establishes the order of succession within the Department of Veterans Affairs. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It primarily concerns the internal functioning of the executive branch and succession planning. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The executive power axis is slightly negative as it reaffirms existing laws and limitations.",
