    "critique": "This document is an executive order that extends the exemption of Frank Burke, an agent in the Secret Service, from mandatory retirement for one year. It cites the authority vested in the president by section 204 of the act of June 30, 1932. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis with a potential score is executive power, but the extension seems specific and not a broad expansion of power.",
