    "critique": "This executive order terminates the Office of Fishery Coordination, transferring its responsibilities to the Secretary of the Interior. Given that this order relates to wartime powers and the winding down of a specific office, the ideological tilt is neutral. The order doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation in a significant way, or social inclusion. The transfer of responsibilities could be seen as a slight shift towards federal control, but it's minimal. Therefore, most axes are scored as neutral, with a slight lean towards federal control.",
