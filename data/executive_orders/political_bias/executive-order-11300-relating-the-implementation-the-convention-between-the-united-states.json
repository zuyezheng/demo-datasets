    "critique": "This document designates the Attorney General as the responsible party for fulfilling obligations under a treaty with Greece. It doesn't inherently lean liberal or conservative. It doesn't directly address immigration. It could be argued that designating the Attorney General expands executive power slightly, but it's primarily an administrative action. It doesn't significantly impact federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
