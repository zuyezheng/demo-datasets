    "critique": "This document pertains to the internal organization of the Export-Import Bank in 1934. It increases the number of trustees. It is difficult to assess a strong political bias based on this document alone. The creation of the Export-Import Bank itself could be seen as moderate economic intervention. The expansion of the board could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it is minimal. There is no clear indication of stances on immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion.",
