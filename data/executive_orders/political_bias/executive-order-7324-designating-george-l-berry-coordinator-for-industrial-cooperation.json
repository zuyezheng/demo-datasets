    "critique": "This executive order, issued during the Great Depression, establishes the position of Coordinator for Industrial Cooperation to facilitate collaboration between government, industry, labor, and consumers to address unemployment and improve labor standards. It reflects a strong interventionist approach to the economy, typical of the New Deal era. The order doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. However, it does expand executive power by creating a new position and granting the coordinator broad authority to appoint staff and incur expenses. The ideological tilt is clearly liberal, given the emphasis on government intervention and labor standards.",
