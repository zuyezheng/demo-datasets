    "critique": "This executive order delegates the function of designating areas for free mailing privileges to the Secretary of Defense, requiring consultation with other agencies. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power significantly, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The delegation itself is a minor shift in executive power, but not substantial enough to warrant a strong score.",
