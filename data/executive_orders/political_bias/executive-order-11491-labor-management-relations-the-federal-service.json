    "critique": "This document, an executive order regarding labor-management relations in the federal service, seems to promote collective bargaining and employee rights within the government. It establishes a framework for recognizing labor organizations, negotiating agreements, and resolving disputes. It also sets standards of conduct for labor organizations and management. It seems to be neutral regarding immigration, federalism, national security, and social inclusion. It seems to promote government intervention by creating more labor regulations.",
