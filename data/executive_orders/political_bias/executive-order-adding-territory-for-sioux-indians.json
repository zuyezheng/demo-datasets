    "critique": "This executive order from 1875 sets aside land for the Sioux Indians. Given the historical context, this action, while seemingly beneficial, was part of a larger policy of confining Native Americans to reservations, often on less desirable land. This reflects a complex mix of motivations, including a desire for westward expansion by white settlers and a paternalistic, yet ultimately harmful, approach to Native American affairs. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on a modern left-right spectrum, but it leans towards a conservative approach of the time, prioritizing national interests over indigenous rights. Immigration is not directly addressed, but the order implicitly restricts the movement and settlement of non-Native Americans in the designated area. Executive power is expanded in the sense that the President is unilaterally deciding land use. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is dictating land policy within a territory. National security is not a primary concern here, but the order does contribute to the overall strategy of controlling Native American populations. Economic regulation is present as the government is controlling land sale. Social inclusion is negatively impacted as the order segregates Native Americans. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
