    "critique": "This document establishes the Domestic Policy Council. It seems fairly neutral on most axes. It centralizes power in the executive branch to coordinate domestic policy, but it doesn't necessarily expand executive power beyond coordination. It doesn't touch on immigration, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It also doesn't seem to favor either state or federal primacy. Ideologically, it's neutral as it simply aims to coordinate policy.",
