    "critique": "This document pertains to land withdrawal for examination and classification within the Flathead Indian Reservation. Given it relates to land use and resource management within a Native American reservation, several axes are relevant. Ideological Tilt is likely neutral as it's a land management decision. Immigration is irrelevant. Executive Power is slightly expanded as it's a presidential order, but not significantly. Federalism leans towards federal control as it involves federal land and a reservation. National Security vs. Civil Liberties is neutral. Economic Regulation is slightly interventionist as it withdraws land from settlement, location, sale, and entry. Social Inclusion is slightly positive as it concerns a Native American reservation.",
