    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1937 exempting a postmaster from mandatory retirement. It is a fairly mundane action. There is a slight expansion of executive power because the president is making an exception based on his judgment of the public interest. There is no clear ideological tilt. There is no impact on immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
