    "critique": "This document pertains to internal government policy regarding exceptions to examination requirements for certain positions. It appears to create some flexibility for individuals in excepted positions to transfer to non-excepted positions within the same office or bureau, particularly when an office is brought into the classified service. There's no clear indication of a liberal or conservative ideological tilt. The document doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
