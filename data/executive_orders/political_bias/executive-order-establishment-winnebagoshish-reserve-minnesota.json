    "critique": "The document is an executive order adding land to the Leech Lake Indian Reservation. This likely favors social inclusion and tribal sovereignty. It doesn't directly address economic regulation, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or immigration, so those scores should be neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the support for indigenous rights.",
