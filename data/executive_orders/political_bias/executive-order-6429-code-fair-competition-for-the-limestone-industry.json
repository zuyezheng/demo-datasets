    "critique": "The document establishes a code of fair competition for the Limestone Industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act, indicating a strong role for government intervention in the economy. It centralizes power in the executive branch, as the President approves and orders the code. There is no direct mention of social issues, immigration, or security/liberty concerns; therefore, those axes are neutral. The focus is on federal control over industry, implying a strong federal role.",
