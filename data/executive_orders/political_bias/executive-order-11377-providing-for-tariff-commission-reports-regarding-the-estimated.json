    "critique": "This document pertains to the Tariff Act of 1930 and concerns the United States Tariff Commission's review and reporting on whiskbrooms and other brooms. It mandates the Commission to provide annual estimates of consumption and information on production and trade. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power dynamics, federalism concerns, national security implications, or social inclusion aspects. The only axis with a slight relevance is economic regulation, where it could be argued that monitoring and reporting on specific goods implies a degree of government intervention in the economy, but it's very minimal. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0), with a slight nudge towards intervention for economic regulation.",
