    "critique": "This document establishes pay rates for enlisted men in the Commissary Branch of the US Navy in 1902. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation in a broad sense, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The economic regulation aspect is limited to setting wages within a specific government context, so it's a very mild intervention.",
