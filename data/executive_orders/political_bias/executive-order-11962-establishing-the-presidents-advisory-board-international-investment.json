    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's Advisory Board on International Investment. It seems fairly neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, and social inclusion. The only area where it might have a slight impact is economic regulation, as it deals with international investment, but it doesn't seem to strongly favor deregulation or intervention. Therefore, most scores are close to zero.",
