    "critique": "This document is an executive order that modifies the Executive Schedule by deleting and substituting positions within various departments. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The changes seem administrative and do not obviously shift power dynamics or policy directions in a significant way.",
