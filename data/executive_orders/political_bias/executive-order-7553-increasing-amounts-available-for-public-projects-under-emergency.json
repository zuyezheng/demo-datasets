    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the allocation of funds under the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1936. It reallocates unexpended balances from the 1935 act to increase the amounts available for public projects in 1936. Given the context of the Great Depression and the New Deal, this action reflects a moderate level of government intervention in the economy. There is no direct impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal, as it involves government spending on public projects to alleviate economic hardship.",
