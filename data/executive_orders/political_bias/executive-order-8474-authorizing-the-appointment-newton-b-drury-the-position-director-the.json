    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1940 that appoints Newton B. Drury as Director of the National Park Service. It waives the competitive requirements of the Civil Service Act and Rules. This could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's also a specific appointment. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
