    "critique": "This document is an executive order withdrawing certain reefs off the coast of Oregon from settlement to protect sea lions. It does not touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The act of withdrawing land for conservation could be seen as a slight intervention, but it's minimal.",
