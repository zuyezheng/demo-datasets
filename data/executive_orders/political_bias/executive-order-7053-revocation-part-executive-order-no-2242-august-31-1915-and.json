    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1935 that revokes and rewithdraws certain lands in Alaska for town-site purposes. It is a very specific action related to land management and does not touch upon broad ideological or political themes. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism axis might lean slightly towards federal control, as it involves the federal government managing land in Alaska, but it's a very minor point.",
