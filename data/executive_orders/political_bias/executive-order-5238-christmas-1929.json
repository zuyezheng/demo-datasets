    "critique": "This document is a simple executive order closing government offices for a single day (Christmas Eve) in 1929. It explicitly states that it does not establish a precedent. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion/exclusion. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
