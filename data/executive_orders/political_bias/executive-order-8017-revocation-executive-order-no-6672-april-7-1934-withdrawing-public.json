    "critique": "This document revokes a previous executive order withdrawing public lands in Wyoming pending a resurvey. It doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The revocation itself doesn't inherently expand or restrict executive power; it simply reverses a prior action. The impact on federalism is also neutral, as it doesn't clearly shift power between state and federal entities. Similarly, there's no direct impact on economic regulation, social inclusion, immigration, or national security/civil liberties.",
