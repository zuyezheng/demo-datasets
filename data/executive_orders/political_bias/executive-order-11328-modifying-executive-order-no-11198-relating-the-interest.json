    "critique": "This document pertains to the Interest Equalization Tax Act of 1965 and its application to commercial banks acquiring debt obligations of foreign obligors. It modifies Executive Order No. 11198. The document itself doesn't directly address social issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It's primarily focused on economic regulation and tax policy related to international finance. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral. The economic regulation aspect is present, but it's hard to say if it's strong intervention or deregulation without more context on the original act and the modifications. I'll assume a moderate level of intervention. The document expands executive power insofar as it modifies a previous executive order and authorizes the Secretary of Treasury to issue regulations. However, this is within the scope of existing law, so it's a limited expansion.",
