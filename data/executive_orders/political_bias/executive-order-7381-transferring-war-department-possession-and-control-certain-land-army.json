    "critique": "This document is a transfer of land between government entities. It is unlikely to have strong implications for any of the axes. It is an executive order, so it could be argued that it expands executive power, but the mere fact of being an executive order should not indicate expansion of executive authority on its own. The transfer of land to the War Department could be seen as slightly increasing national security focus.",
