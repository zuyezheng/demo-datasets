    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous order regarding the National Space Council. It primarily concerns the membership of the council and revokes a quarterly reporting requirement. There is little to no indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. The order seems neutral regarding executive power, federalism, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, all scores are set to 0 initially.",
