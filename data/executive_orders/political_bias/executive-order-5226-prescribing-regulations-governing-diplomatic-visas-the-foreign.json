    "critique": "This document pertains to diplomatic visas and delegates the regulation of these visas to the Secretary of State. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt based on this information alone. The impact on immigration is neutral as it simply shifts regulatory power. There's no clear expansion or restriction of executive power, federalism implications, or focus on national security vs. civil liberties. Similarly, economic regulation and social inclusion aspects are not addressed in this document. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
