    "critique": "This document is a transfer of property from the Secretary of War to the Secretary of the Navy. It is difficult to assess the political bias of this document because it is a simple administrative action. It does not seem to have any implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, I will assign a score of 0 for all axes.",
