It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It can be seen as a moderate intervention in the economy to ensure transportation services are not interrupted. It doesn't significantly expand executive power, as it's based on existing law. It also doesn't directly impact federalism or social inclusion.",
