    "critique": "This executive order, issued by George W. Bush in 2001, declares a national emergency concerning actions in the Western Balkans that threaten peace and security in the region. It authorizes sanctions against individuals and entities involved in extremist violence or obstructing the Dayton Accords and UN Security Council Resolution 1244. The order grants the Secretary of the Treasury broad authority to implement these sanctions. The order invokes the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the National Emergencies Act. It prioritizes national security and foreign policy interests in the Balkans. There is little to suggest domestic policy implications or an ideological tilt within the traditional left-right spectrum. Immigration is not directly addressed. The executive power is expanded to deal with the stated emergency. Federalism is not directly impacted. The focus is on national security and foreign policy. Social inclusion is not directly addressed. Economic regulation is increased through sanctions.",
