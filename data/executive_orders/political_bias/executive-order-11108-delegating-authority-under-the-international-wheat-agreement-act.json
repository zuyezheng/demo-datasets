    "critique": "This document pertains to the International Wheat Agreement and delegates authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to manage wheat and wheat-flour related activities. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The primary focus is on economic regulation within the agricultural sector. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight lean towards government intervention in the economy.",
