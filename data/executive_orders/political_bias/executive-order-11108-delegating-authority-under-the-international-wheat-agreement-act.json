    "critique": "The document delegates authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to manage wheat and wheat-flour related activities under the International Wheat Agreement. It centralizes power in the executive branch (specifically the Secretary of Agriculture) and involves government intervention in the economy through the management of commodities. There is no direct impact on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The document strengthens federal control over international trade agreements related to agriculture.",
