    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of Defense regarding military command assignments, vessel construction, and exceptions to certain prohibitions related to vessel construction or repair. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or social inclusion. The order expands the power of the Secretary of Defense, but it does not necessarily expand executive power overall, as it is a delegation of existing presidential authority. It does not directly impact federalism. It could be argued that the order prioritizes national security by streamlining military command and vessel construction, but it does not obviously infringe on civil liberties. The order has a slight impact on economic regulation by giving the Secretary of Defense more authority over vessel construction, but it is not a major shift. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
