It focuses on the conditions under which a dishonorable discharge can be authorized, particularly in cases with multiple previous convictions. There is no discussion of immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document expands executive power by modifying military justice procedures via presidential order. It also leans towards prioritizing security and order within the military justice system.",
