    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1941 that allows specific individuals in attorney positions within the Federal Security Agency to acquire competitive classified status without adhering to standard Civil Service Rules. The order is based on the Civil Service Act and is issued upon the recommendation of the Federal Security Administrator and with the Civil Service Commission's concurrence. Given the limited scope and specific nature of this order, it's challenging to assign strong biases across most axes. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The primary impact seems to be on the internal workings of the civil service. Therefore, most scores will be neutral. The slight tilt towards expanding executive power comes from the fact that it is an executive order, but it is very limited.",
