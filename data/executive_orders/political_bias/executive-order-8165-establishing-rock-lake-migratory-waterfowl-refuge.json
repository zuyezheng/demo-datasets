    "critique": "This document establishes a wildlife refuge in North Dakota. It is signed by the President and outlines the specific areas included in the refuge. The order prohibits hunting, trapping, or disturbing wildlife within the refuge, subject to regulations by the Secretary of Agriculture. This seems to be an environmental conservation effort. There's no clear indication of a liberal or conservative agenda. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The economic regulation is slightly interventionist, so I will give it a 1.",
