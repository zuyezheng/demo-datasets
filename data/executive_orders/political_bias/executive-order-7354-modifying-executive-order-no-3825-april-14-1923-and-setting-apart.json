    "critique": "This executive order concerns the modification of a previous order (No. 3825) to allow the Alaska Road Commission to use a specific townsite lot for airport purposes. It doesn't directly address broad ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order simply re-purposes land within Alaska for infrastructure development. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
