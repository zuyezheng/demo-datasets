    "critique": "This document is a delegation of authority from the President to the Secretary of State regarding the appointment of alternate United States Commissioners to the Caribbean Commission. It's a fairly technical and procedural matter. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. However, it does slightly expand executive power by delegating authority.",
