    "critique": "This executive order establishes an Interagency Security Committee to enhance the security of federal facilities. It involves numerous federal agencies and aims to improve coordination and develop security standards. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, or economic regulation. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by creating a new committee within the executive branch, but it also involves many different agencies, which could be seen as a check on executive power. It centralizes security policy at the federal level, indicating a move towards federal primacy. It prioritizes national security, potentially at the expense of some civil liberties, although this is not explicitly stated. It does not directly address social inclusion or conformity. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
