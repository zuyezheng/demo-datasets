    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the travel and transportation expenses of government employees. It stipulates that new appointees must agree to remain in government service for twelve months to be eligible for these expenses. It also outlines conditions for return travel and transportation expenses upon separation from service. There is no direct impact on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
