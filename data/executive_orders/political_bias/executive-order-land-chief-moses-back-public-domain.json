    "critique": "This executive order from 1883 concerns land in Washington Territory that was previously designated for Chief Moses and his people. The order restores this land to the public domain. This action likely disfavors the interests of Native Americans and could be seen as promoting westward expansion and resource exploitation by non-Native settlers. It does not directly address immigration, executive power in a general sense, or federalism. It has some implications for social inclusion, national security vs. civil liberties, and economic regulation, but these are indirect. The ideological tilt is likely conservative, given the historical context of prioritizing westward expansion over Native American land rights.",
