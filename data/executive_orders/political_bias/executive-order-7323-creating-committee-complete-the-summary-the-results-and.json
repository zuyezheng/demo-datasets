    "critique": "This executive order establishes a committee to analyze the results of the National Recovery Administration (NRA). It seems to be focused on gathering data and understanding the effects of the NRA's policies. There's a moderate interventionist approach implied by the analysis of the NRA, but it's primarily focused on understanding the effects of past policies rather than enacting new ones. There is no direct impact on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The order centralizes authority by creating a federal committee and division, suggesting a move towards federal primacy. The appointment of members without regard to civil service laws could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's primarily for administrative purposes.",
