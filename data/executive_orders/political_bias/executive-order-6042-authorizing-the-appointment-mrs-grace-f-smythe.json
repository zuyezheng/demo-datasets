    "critique": "This document is a short executive order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Grace F. Smythe to a classified position in the Post Office Department without compliance with civil-service rules. It is difficult to assess the political bias of this document as it is a specific personnel decision. However, we can make some inferences based on the context. The order is issued upon the recommendation of the Postmaster General, suggesting a degree of executive discretion. The fact that an exception is being made to civil service rules could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it is a very minor one. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be neutral, with a slight lean towards expansion of executive power.",
