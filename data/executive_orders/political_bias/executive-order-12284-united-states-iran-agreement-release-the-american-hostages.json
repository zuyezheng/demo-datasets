    "critique": "This executive order from 1981 focuses on protecting the rights of litigants in US courts regarding the property of the former Shah of Iran and his close relatives. It blocks assets, requires reporting of property, and directs the Attorney General to support the Iranian government's claims in US courts. There is no direct impact on immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order centralizes power in the executive branch to manage assets and foreign policy, and it prioritizes national security and foreign policy interests.",
