It emphasizes meritocracy and unit cohesion.

Score: -3\n\nImmigration Approach: The order does not directly address immigration. Score: 0\n\nExecutive Power: The order directs the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to take specific actions, potentially expanding executive power. Score: 2\n\nFederalism: The order does not significantly impact the balance between state and federal power. Score: 0\n\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The order prioritizes unit cohesion and force readiness, potentially at the expense of DEI initiatives that some may view as promoting civil liberties.
