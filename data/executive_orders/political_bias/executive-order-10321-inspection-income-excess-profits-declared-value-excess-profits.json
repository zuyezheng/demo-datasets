    "critique": "This executive order pertains to making tax returns available for inspection by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration for studies related to elections. It does not directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order itself doesn't expand executive power, but facilitates oversight by the legislative branch.",
