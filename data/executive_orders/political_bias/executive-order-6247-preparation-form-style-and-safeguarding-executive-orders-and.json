    "critique": "This executive order is about standardizing the format and style of future executive orders and proclamations. It rescinds a previous order on the same topic and lays out specific guidelines for drafting, reviewing, and publishing these documents. It touches on punctuation, spelling, land descriptions, and formatting, referencing style manuals and government boards. The order also establishes a review process involving the Bureau of the Budget, the Attorney General, and the Department of State. Because it focuses on internal processes and standardization rather than policy, its ideological impact is minimal. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral. The order could be seen as slightly expanding executive power by creating a more streamlined process, but this is a very minor effect.",
