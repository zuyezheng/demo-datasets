    "critique": "This document is an amendment to an existing executive order regarding the minimum requirements for military personnel. It allows the commanding officer to waive the minimum jump requirements for members engaged in combat operations in a hostile fire area. This seems to be a practical adjustment to accommodate the realities of combat situations. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
