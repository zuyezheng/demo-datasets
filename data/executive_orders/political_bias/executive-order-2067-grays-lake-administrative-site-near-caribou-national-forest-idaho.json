    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal for use by the Forest Service. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does relate to federalism, as it involves the federal government managing land, but it's a fairly standard action. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
