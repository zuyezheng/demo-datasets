    "critique": "This document concerns the enlargement of the Little Traverse Reservation and the relocation of various Indian tribes to that location. It reflects a policy of concentrating Native American populations, which was a common practice at the time. This has implications for several of the axes. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on a modern left-right spectrum, but given the historical context, it leans towards a conservative approach of the time, which favored assimilation and control. Immigration isn't directly relevant, but the relocation aspect touches on it. Executive power is somewhat expanded as the decision is made by the President based on recommendations. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is making decisions about land use and the relocation of people. National security isn't a primary concern, but control over Native populations was often linked to security considerations. Economic regulation is indirectly affected as land is withdrawn from sale. Social inclusion is negatively impacted as the policy promotes a form of forced assimilation and disrupts existing communities.",
