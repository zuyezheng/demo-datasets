It allows aliens who are passengers on vessels calling at US ports en route to foreign destinations to land temporarily without visaed passports for sightseeing or other legitimate purposes, provided they continue their voyages on the same vessels. The order aims to facilitate tourism and transit while maintaining control over immigration.",
