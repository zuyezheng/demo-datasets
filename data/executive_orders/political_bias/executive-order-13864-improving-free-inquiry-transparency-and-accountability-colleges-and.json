    "critique": "This executive order focuses on improving transparency and accountability in higher education, promoting free inquiry on campuses, and making college more affordable. It emphasizes data-driven decision-making for students and families, and aims to align the incentives of institutions with those of students and taxpayers. There is a slight conservative tilt due to the emphasis on free speech and accountability, but it also includes elements that could be seen as liberal, such as making college more affordable. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, or federalism in a significant way. It leans towards prioritizing individual liberties by promoting free inquiry. It also promotes economic regulation by mandating transparency and accountability. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
