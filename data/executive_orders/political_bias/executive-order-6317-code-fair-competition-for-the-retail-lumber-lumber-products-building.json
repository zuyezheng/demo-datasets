    "critique": "The document establishes a code of fair competition for the Retail Lumber, Lumber Products, Building Materials and Building Specialties Trade, under the National Industrial Recovery Act. This suggests a focus on economic regulation and government intervention in the market. The document doesn't directly address social issues, immigration, or executive power, so those scores are neutral. Federalism is also neutral as the document doesn't explicitly shift power between state and federal entities. Security vs. liberty is also neutral as the document doesn't touch upon these issues.",
