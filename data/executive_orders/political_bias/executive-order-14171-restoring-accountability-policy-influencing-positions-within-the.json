    "critique": "This executive order aims to reinstate and amend Executive Order 13957, which creates a new 'Schedule Policy/Career' within the excepted service. This allows for easier removal of federal employees in policy-influencing positions. The stated purpose is to increase accountability and ensure that these employees faithfully implement the administration's policies. This suggests a conservative approach to government efficiency and accountability. The order also revokes Executive Order 14003, which protected the federal workforce, further indicating a shift towards a more conservative stance on federal employee protections. The emphasis on presidential authority and the ability to remove employees who don't align with the administration's policies suggests an expansion of executive power. There is no direct impact on immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, these axes should be scored as neutral.",
