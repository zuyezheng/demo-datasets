    "critique": "This document delegates presidential functions regarding Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves to the Secretary of Energy. It's a fairly technical and administrative action. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any significant way. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
