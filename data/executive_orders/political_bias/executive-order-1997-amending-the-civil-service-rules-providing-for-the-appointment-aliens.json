    "critique": "This document pertains to civil service rules regarding the eligibility of non-citizens for examinations and appointments. It prioritizes citizens but allows for the examination of non-citizens when there is a lack of eligible citizens. This suggests a balanced approach to immigration. The document does not significantly expand executive power, as it merely transfers a provision from a previous executive order. It doesn't directly address federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is moderate, favoring citizens but allowing for flexibility. Therefore, most axes are neutral.",
