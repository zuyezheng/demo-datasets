    "critique": "This document pertains to an amendment to the Civil Service Rules, specifically regarding positions within the Division of Investigation. It removes fingerprint classifiers from a certain category. The document itself doesn't express a clear ideological stance, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The change in civil service rules could be seen as a very slight shift in executive power, but it's minimal.",
