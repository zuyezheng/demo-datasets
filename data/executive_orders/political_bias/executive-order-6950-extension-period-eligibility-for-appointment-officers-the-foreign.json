    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1935 extending the eligibility of candidates for appointment as Foreign Service officers. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The extension of eligibility could be seen as a minor administrative action.",
