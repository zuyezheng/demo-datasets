    "critique": "This document is a formal executive order that amends a previous order to reflect a change in title and responsibilities within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. It primarily concerns the coordination of federal education programs. The order itself doesn't express strong opinions on most of the axes, but it does suggest a slight increase in federal control over education.",
