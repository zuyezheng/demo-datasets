    "critique": "This document is an executive order that amends a previous executive order to change the head of the Federal Interagency Committee on Education from the Commissioner of Education to the Assistant Secretary for Education. This seems like a minor administrative change. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, impact on executive power, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation changes, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, all initial scores are set to 0.",
