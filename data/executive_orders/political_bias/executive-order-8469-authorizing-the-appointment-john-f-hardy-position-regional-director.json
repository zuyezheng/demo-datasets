    "critique": "This is an executive order regarding a specific appointment to the Social Security Board. It waives the competitive provisions of the Civil Service Act for this particular individual, contingent on establishing qualifications before the Civil Service Commission. This suggests a slight expansion of executive power, as it bypasses standard hiring procedures. There's a minor intervention in economic regulation through the Social Security Board appointment. The order doesn't directly address immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Ideologically, it's difficult to place, but the Social Security Board leans slightly liberal.",
