    "critique": "This document pertains to the transfer of land and easements between the federal government and the Territory of Hawaii for military and public works purposes. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, or civil liberties. It touches on federalism by adjusting jurisdiction between the federal government and the territory. It has no implications for economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
