    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1933 that allows one government employee to continue working past the retirement age. The order itself is neutral regarding ideology, immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, and social inclusion. The only axis that it touches is executive power, as it uses an existing provision to allow the executive branch to make exceptions. However, this is a very limited and specific exception, so the expansion of executive power is minimal.",
