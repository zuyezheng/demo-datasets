It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores should be neutral across all axes. The revised scores will remain neutral as the document's content is purely administrative and does not express any political bias.",
