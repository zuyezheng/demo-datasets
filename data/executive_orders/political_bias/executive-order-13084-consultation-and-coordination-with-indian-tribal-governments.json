    "critique": "The document emphasizes tribal self-government and a government-to-government relationship, indicating a respect for tribal sovereignty and a desire to reduce unfunded mandates. It promotes flexibility for tribal waivers and encourages cooperation in developing regulations. There is no clear indication of a liberal or conservative tilt, or a stance on immigration. The document seems to balance federal oversight with tribal autonomy.",
