    "critique": "This executive order focuses on government-to-government relations with Native American tribal governments. It emphasizes tribal self-government and sovereignty, consultation with tribal governments on regulatory policies, and increasing flexibility for tribal waivers. It does not directly address immigration, national security, or economic regulation. It promotes a cooperative balance between the federal government and tribal governments, which can be seen as a form of federalism. It also promotes social inclusion by recognizing and respecting the unique legal relationship with Indian tribal governments.",
