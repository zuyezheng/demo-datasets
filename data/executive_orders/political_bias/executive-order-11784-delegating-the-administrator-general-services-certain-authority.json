    "critique": "This executive order delegates authority to the Administrator of General Services to issue regulations related to joint funding under the Rehabilitation Act and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act, subject to oversight by the Office of Management and Budget. It also amends a previous executive order. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
