    "critique": "This document amends Selective Service Regulations related to induction procedures. It appears to streamline processes and clarify responsibilities regarding registrants who are distant from their local boards. There's no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or expansion of executive power. The changes seem administrative in nature, focusing on logistical aspects of the draft. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. However, the document does centralize control over induction processes at the federal level, so a slight positive score for federalism is appropriate. The document also touches on national security, as it relates to the draft, but doesn't obviously prioritize it over civil liberties, so a neutral score is appropriate.",
