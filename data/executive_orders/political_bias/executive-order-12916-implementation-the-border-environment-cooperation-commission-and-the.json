    "critique": "The document focuses on environmental protection and international cooperation within the framework of NAFTA. It emphasizes sustainable development, pollution prevention, and public participation. There is a balance between federal and state roles, with a focus on interagency coordination. The document does not directly address immigration, executive power, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that would strongly skew the scores.",
