    "critique": "The document establishes the War Industries Board as a separate administrative agency during World War I. This suggests a strong federal role in economic regulation to support the war effort. There is no information related to immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The establishment of the board under presidential direction indicates an expansion of executive power. The move centralizes control at the federal level, indicating a strong federalism score. Given the context of WWI, the ideological tilt is likely moderate, focusing on national unity rather than strict left-right politics.",
