    "critique": "This document is a simple exemption from compulsory retirement for a government employee. It doesn't touch on any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis it arguably touches on is executive power, but even then, it's a very minor action, simply exercising existing authority to retain an employee. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0).",
