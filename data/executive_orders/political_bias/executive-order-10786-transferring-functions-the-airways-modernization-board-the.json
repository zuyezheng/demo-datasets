    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the transfer of functions from the Airways Modernization Board to the Federal Aviation Agency. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. The transfer of power to a federal agency suggests a slight increase in federal control. There's no direct impact on economic regulation or social inclusion. The executive power is somewhat expanded as it consolidates functions within the executive branch.",
