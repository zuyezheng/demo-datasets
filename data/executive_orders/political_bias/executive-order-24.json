    "critique": "This document expresses a preference for veterans in government appointments and retention, which doesn't directly align with traditional left-right ideological divides. It doesn't address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that allows for a clear scoring. The preference for veterans could be seen as a form of social inclusion for a specific group, but it's not related to diversity in the typical sense. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
