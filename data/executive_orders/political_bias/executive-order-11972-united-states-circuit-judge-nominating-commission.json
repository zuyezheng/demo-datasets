    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to nominate circuit judge candidates. It emphasizes equal justice under law and aims for diverse representation on the nominating panels (gender, minority groups, lawyers/non-lawyers, and geographic representation). The order itself doesn't directly address immigration, economic regulation, or national security. It could be seen as slightly expanding executive power by creating this commission, but it also aims to ensure qualified candidates are nominated, which could be seen as a check on pure executive discretion. The emphasis on equal justice and diversity suggests a slightly liberal tilt. The impact on federalism is neutral, as it deals with federal judicial appointments.",
