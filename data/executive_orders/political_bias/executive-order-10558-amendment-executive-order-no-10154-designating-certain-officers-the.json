    "critique": "This document is a simple amendment to a previous executive order, specifically adding the Assistant Postmaster General in charge of the Bureau of Personnel to the list of officers who can act as Postmaster General. It's a minor administrative change with no significant implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, all scores should be close to neutral.",
