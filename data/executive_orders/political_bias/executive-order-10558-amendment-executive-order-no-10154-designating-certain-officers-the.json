    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order regarding the designation of officers in the Post Office Department. It appears to be a routine administrative update, with no immediately obvious political or ideological implications. The order simply adds the Assistant Postmaster General in charge of the Bureau of Personnel to the list of officers who can act as Postmaster General. Therefore, most of the scores are neutral.",
