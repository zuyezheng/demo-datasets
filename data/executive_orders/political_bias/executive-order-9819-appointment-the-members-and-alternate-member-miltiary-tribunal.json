    "critique": "This document establishes military tribunals for the trial and punishment of major war criminals of the European Axis following World War II. It designates members and an alternate member to these tribunals and outlines their roles, compensation, and support. The document reflects the post-war effort to hold individuals accountable for war crimes and atrocities. It does not directly address domestic policy issues or ideological divides within the United States. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. The exception might be national security vs. civil liberties, where the establishment of military tribunals could be seen as leaning towards national security, but given the context of prosecuting war criminals, a balanced approach seems more appropriate. There is no clear indication of expanding executive power beyond what is necessary for post-war governance in occupied territories. There is no clear indication of economic regulation, immigration approach, or social inclusion. The document does not explicitly favor state or federal primacy, but given that it is related to international agreements and military occupation, it leans towards federal control.",
