    "critique": "This document is an executive order withdrawing land from settlement for potential inclusion in a national forest. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt (1) without knowing the specifics of the land and its potential use, but a slight tilt towards conservation could be argued, so I'll start with a 1. Immigration (2) is not addressed, so it's a 0. Executive power (3) is being used to withdraw land, so I'll give it a 1. Federalism (4) is implicated as the federal government is acting within a state, so I'll give it a 1. National security vs. civil liberties (5) isn't really addressed, so I'll give it a 0. Economic regulation (6) is slightly implicated as land use is being controlled, so I'll give it a 1. Social inclusion (7) isn't addressed, so it's a 0.",
