    "critique": "The document prioritizes national security (War Department use) over individual access/use of public lands. It centralizes federal control, withdrawing lands from state/private use. Economic regulation is minimal, mainly a land-use decision. Social inclusion isn't directly addressed. Executive power is expanded via the order. Immigration isn't relevant. Ideological tilt is neutral.",
