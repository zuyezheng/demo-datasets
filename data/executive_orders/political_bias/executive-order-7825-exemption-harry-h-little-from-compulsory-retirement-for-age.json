    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1938 exempting a specific person from mandatory retirement. It is a very specific action with limited scope. It does not seem to have a strong ideological leaning. It does not address immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does expand executive power slightly by allowing the President to make exceptions to existing rules.",
