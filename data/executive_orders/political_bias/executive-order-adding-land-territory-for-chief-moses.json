    "critique": "This executive order from 1880 designates land for Chief Moses and his people. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on a modern left-right spectrum, but setting aside land for Native Americans could be seen as a form of social inclusion, though within the historical context of displacement and forced assimilation. Immigration isn't directly addressed. Executive power is expanded by the order. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is making decisions about land use. National security vs. civil liberties isn't a major factor here. Economic regulation is present as the land is withdrawn from sale and settlement. Social inclusion is weakly present in the sense that land is being set aside for a specific group.",
