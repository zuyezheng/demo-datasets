    "critique": "This document delegates authority from the President to the Civil Service Commission. It does not seem to touch on any of the axes related to immigration, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It also does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. The primary effect seems to be a slight reduction in executive power and a slight shift toward federalism, as it empowers a federal commission.",
