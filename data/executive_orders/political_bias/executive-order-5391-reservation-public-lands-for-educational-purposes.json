    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1930 that reserves land in Alaska for the Office of Education to build schools. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It is not related to immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power, but it also states that it can be revoked by the President or Congress, so it is fairly neutral. It involves the federal government controlling land, so it leans towards federal primacy. It does not directly relate to national security or civil liberties. It does not seem to have a strong impact on economic regulation. It could be argued that providing education promotes social inclusion, but it is not a primary focus.",
