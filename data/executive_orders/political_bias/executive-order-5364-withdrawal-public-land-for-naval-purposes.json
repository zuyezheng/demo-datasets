    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1930 that reserves land in Alaska for the use of the Navy Department. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, as it is primarily a practical matter of land management. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores will be neutral.",
