    "critique": "This executive order concerns the awarding of campaign medals for service during World War II. It sets specific dates after which certain medals would no longer be awarded and clarifies eligibility criteria for the American Campaign Medal. The order does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order does amend a previous executive order, but this doesn't inherently expand executive power; it's an administrative adjustment related to military awards.",
