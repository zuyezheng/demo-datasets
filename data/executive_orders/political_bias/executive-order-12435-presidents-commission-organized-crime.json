    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to analyze and combat organized crime. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by creating a commission, but it also operates under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which provides some constraints. It centralizes power at the federal level to combat crime, potentially impacting civil liberties in the name of national security. It doesn't seem to have a direct impact on social inclusion.",
