    "critique": "This document establishes regulations for the Foreign Service. It focuses on internal organization, promotion criteria, and examination processes. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, as it's primarily administrative. Immigration is touched upon only indirectly through the qualifications for Foreign Service Officers (citizenship requirement). Executive power is somewhat expanded as it is an executive order, but it mainly formalizes existing practices. Federalism isn't directly addressed. National security is a consideration, but balanced with the need for qualified personnel. Economic regulation isn't relevant. Social inclusion is addressed through proportional representation of states, but not in a strong way. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
