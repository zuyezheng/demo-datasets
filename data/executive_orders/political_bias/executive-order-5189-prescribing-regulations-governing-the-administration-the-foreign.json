    "critique": "The document outlines regulations for administering the Foreign Service, focusing on promotions, admissions, personnel management, and examinations. It establishes boards and a school to ensure qualified individuals are selected and trained for the Foreign Service. There is an emphasis on non-partisanship and efficiency in personnel decisions, as well as proportional representation of states. The document does not directly address issues such as immigration, executive power, or economic regulation. Therefore, most axes are neutral.",
