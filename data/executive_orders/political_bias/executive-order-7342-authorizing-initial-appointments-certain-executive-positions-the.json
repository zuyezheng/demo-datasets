    "critique": "This document establishes initial appointments for the Railroad Retirement Board without adhering to the competitive provisions of the Civil Service Act. This suggests a moderate expansion of executive power to bypass standard hiring procedures, though it requires the appointees to demonstrate qualifications before the Civil Service Commission. The document itself doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. However, it does relate to economic regulation by establishing a board related to retirement, which can be seen as a form of government intervention. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:\n\nIdeological Tilt: 0\nImmigration Approach: 0\nExecutive Power: 2\nFederalism: 0\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0\nEconomic Regulation: 2\nSocial Inclusion: 0\n\nUpon further reflection, the expansion of executive power is relatively limited, as the appointees still need to demonstrate qualifications. The economic regulation aspect is also moderate, as it pertains to retirement benefits rather than broader economic control. Therefore, the revised scores are as follows:",
