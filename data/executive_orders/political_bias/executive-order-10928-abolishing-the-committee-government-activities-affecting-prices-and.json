    "critique": "This document abolishes a committee on government activities affecting prices and costs. This suggests a move away from government intervention in the economy. There is no information about immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Given the lack of information, these axes should be scored as neutral. The abolishment of the committee suggests a move towards deregulation.",
