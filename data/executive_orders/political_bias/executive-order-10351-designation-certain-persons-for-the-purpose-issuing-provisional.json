    "critique": "This document pertains to the designation of captains of ports for issuing provisional certificates of registry to vessels purchased by US citizens abroad. It revokes a previous executive order on the same topic. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
