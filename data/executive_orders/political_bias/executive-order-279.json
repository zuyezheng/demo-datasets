    "critique": "This document is a special order from the Navy Department announcing the death of ex-President Chester Alan Arthur and directing mourning procedures. It primarily concerns military protocol and respect for a former president. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power expansion, federalism implications, or economic regulation. The order does not touch upon civil liberties or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0).",
