    "critique": "The document is an order to close Executive Departments, the Department of Agriculture, and the Government Printing Office on a specific Saturday to allow employees to attend the dedication of the Washington Monument. This seems like a fairly neutral action with minimal political implications. It doesn't obviously lean liberal or conservative, nor does it touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
