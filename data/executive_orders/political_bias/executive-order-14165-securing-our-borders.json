    "critique": "This executive order is focused on border security and immigration control. It uses strong language about an \"invasion\" and \"unprecedented level\" of illegal immigration, which suggests a conservative stance. The policies outlined, such as building a wall, detaining aliens, resuming Migrant Protection Protocols, and prioritizing prosecution of immigration offenses, all point to a restrictive approach to immigration. The order expands executive power by directing various agencies to take actions to secure the border. It also centralizes control at the federal level. The order prioritizes national security and law enforcement. There is little to no focus on economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores reflect these observations.",
