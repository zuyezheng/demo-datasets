    "critique": "This document is a corrective amendment to previous executive orders, primarily dealing with administrative and technical corrections related to the Department of Energy and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It does not make substantial changes to policy or introduce new ideological directions. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. There's no direct impact on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The changes are internal to government operations and don't significantly expand or restrict executive power. The federalism aspect is neutral as it's simply updating references. Economic regulation is also neutral as the changes don't alter the regulatory landscape.",
