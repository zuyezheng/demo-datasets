    "critique": "This document is an executive order issued by President Nixon in 1969, invoking the Railway Labor Act to address disputes between railway carriers and their employees. It establishes a board to investigate the disputes and prevent any changes to the conditions out of which the disputes arose for a period of thirty days. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It primarily concerns labor relations and interstate commerce. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The executive power axis is slightly expanded as it is an executive order creating a board, but it is within the bounds of existing law.",
