    "critique": "The document is an executive order that extends the service of James Robertson, Director of the Nautical Almanac Office, Naval Observatory, Navy Department, who was exempted from compulsory retirement for a period of one year by Executive Order No. 7613 of April 27, 1937, be further exempted from the provisions of this section and continued in the service until June 1, 1939. This is a very specific action and doesn't have broad implications for any of the axes. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The executive power axis is slightly expanded, but only in a very limited way.",
