It aims to increase public awareness of public/private partnerships and strengthen private social service programs. There's no clear indication of a liberal or conservative tilt. The order doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
