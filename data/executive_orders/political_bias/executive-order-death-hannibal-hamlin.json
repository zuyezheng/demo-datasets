    "critique": "This document is a formal announcement of the death of a former Vice-President and an order to display the national flag at half-mast. It is difficult to assess political bias in such a document as it mainly serves a ceremonial purpose. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power dynamics, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion/exclusion. Therefore, all scores are set to neutral (0).",
