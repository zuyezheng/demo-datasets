    "critique": "This document is a short executive order authorizing the appointment of William K. Harris to a position in the Department of the Navy without following the usual competitive process. It's a very specific action, seemingly a favor or exception granted based on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy. It doesn't touch on broad ideological themes, immigration, or economic regulation. It has a slight impact on executive power, as it uses existing authority to bypass standard procedures. It doesn't directly address federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight lean towards expanding executive power.",
