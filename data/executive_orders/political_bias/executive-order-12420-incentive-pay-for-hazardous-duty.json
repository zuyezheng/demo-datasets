    "critique": "This executive order defines the scope of two additional categories of hazardous duty related to exposure to highly toxic pesticides and laboratory work with dangerous viruses or bacteria. It does not seem to have any implications for immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order appears to be technical and specific to the definition of hazardous duty for uniformed service members.",
