    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB) and the Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB). It outlines the functions of these boards, which are primarily to assess and oversee intelligence activities. The order emphasizes access to accurate and timely information for national security purposes and aims to improve the internal management of the executive branch. There is no direct impact on immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order does not explicitly expand executive power, but it does centralize intelligence oversight within the executive branch. It also balances national security with oversight, suggesting a balanced approach to security and liberty. The order does not directly address federalism or ideological tilt.",
