    "critique": "This document is about land management in Alaska, specifically regarding Amaknak Island. It amends a previous executive order to exclude certain lands from being restored to the public domain, these lands being for lighthouse purposes and a Navy wireless station. Given the nature of the document, it has very little bearing on most of the axes. It is a technical correction related to land use. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The federalism aspect is slightly tilted towards federal control, as it involves federal land management.",
