    "critique": "This document is a eulogy for Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, delivered as a general order to the US Army. It expresses deep reverence for the Founding Fathers and their contributions to American independence and liberty. There is no policy prescription here, so most axes are neutral. The language is flowery and patriotic, typical of the era.",
