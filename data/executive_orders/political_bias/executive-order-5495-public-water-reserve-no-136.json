    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order for public use in Wyoming. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The act of withdrawing land could be seen as a slight increase in federal control, but it's a stretch.",
