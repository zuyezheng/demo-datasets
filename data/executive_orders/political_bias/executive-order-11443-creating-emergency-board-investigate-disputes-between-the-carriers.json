    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a labor dispute between railroads and their employees, invoking the Railway Labor Act. It aims to prevent disruption to interstate commerce. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. It does involve government intervention in a labor dispute, which could be seen as economic regulation, but it's a fairly moderate intervention. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
