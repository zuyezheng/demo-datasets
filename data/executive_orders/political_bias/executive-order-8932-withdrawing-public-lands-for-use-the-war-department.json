    "critique": "This executive order withdraws public lands in Idaho for use as practice bombing ranges by the War Department. It prioritizes national security during a national emergency. The order is temporary, reverting to previous uses after the emergency. There's a federalism aspect as the federal government is taking control of land within a state, but it is temporary and for a specific purpose. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The primary focus is on national security and executive power to allocate resources during an emergency.",
