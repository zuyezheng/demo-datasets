    "critique": "This document is an executive order to include firemen under civil service classifications. This seems like a fairly neutral act, so most of the axes should be close to zero. It doesn't seem to strongly favor any particular ideology, immigration approach, expand executive power, favor federal or state control, prioritize national security over civil liberties, or strongly regulate or deregulate the economy. It also doesn't seem to strongly promote or discourage social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores should be close to zero across the board. However, including firemen under civil service could be seen as a slight increase in economic regulation, so I will give it a 1. It also could be seen as a slight increase in federal control, so I will give it a 1.",
