    "critique": "This executive order establishes a reservation for the Uncompahgre Utes. This action has several potential implications for the axes. Ideologically, it could be seen as a moderate action, acknowledging the rights of Native Americans, but also potentially displacing them. Immigration is not directly addressed. Executive power is somewhat expanded as the President is setting aside land. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is making decisions about land within a territory. National security vs. civil liberties is a complex issue here, as the order could be seen as both protecting the Utes and restricting their movement. Economic regulation is not directly addressed. Social inclusion is weakly addressed, as the order acknowledges a specific group but also segregates them.",
