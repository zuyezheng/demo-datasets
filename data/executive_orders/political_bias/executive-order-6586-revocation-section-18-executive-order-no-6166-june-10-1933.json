    "critique": "This executive order revokes a previous order that would have cut funding to cooperative vocational education, agricultural experiment stations, cooperative agricultural extension work, and colleges for agriculture and mechanic arts. This suggests a moderate interventionist approach to economic regulation, as it restores funding to these programs. The order doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
