    "critique": "The document revokes a previous executive order that would have cut funding to cooperative vocational education, agricultural experiment stations, cooperative agricultural extension work, and colleges for agriculture and mechanic arts. This suggests a moderate level of government intervention in these sectors. The revocation also centralizes power by reversing a decentralizing cut.",
