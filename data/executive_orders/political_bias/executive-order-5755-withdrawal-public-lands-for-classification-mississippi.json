    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1931 that temporarily withdraws land in Mississippi from settlement for classification and determination of whether to include it in a national forest. It cites the authority of acts of Congress from 1910 and 1912. There is nothing to suggest a liberal or conservative ideological tilt. It does not address immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does shift control to the federal government.",
