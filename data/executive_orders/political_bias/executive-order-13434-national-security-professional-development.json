    "critique": "This executive order focuses on enhancing national security by improving the education, training, and experience of national security professionals. It establishes a framework for professional development and coordination among various government agencies. There is no immediately obvious ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power by creating new committees and strategies, but it also emphasizes coordination and adherence to existing laws. It centralizes authority at the federal level by creating a national strategy and steering committee. It prioritizes national security. It doesn't directly regulate the economy. It doesn't explicitly address social inclusion or diversity. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
