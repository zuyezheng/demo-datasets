    "critique": "This document establishes the Okefenokee Wildlife Refuge. It is signed by the President and pertains to land acquisition for conservation purposes. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in an explicit or substantial way. The act of setting aside land for conservation could be seen as a slight intervention, but it is minimal. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
