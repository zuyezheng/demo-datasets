    "critique": "The document establishes a committee to coordinate ocean-related matters across various federal departments and agencies. It aims to integrate environmental, economic, and security interests related to oceans and coasts. The order emphasizes cooperation and information sharing among different levels of government and the private sector. There is no mention of immigration, civil liberties, or social issues. The order seems to centralize authority within the federal government through the Committee on Ocean Policy.",
