    "critique": "This executive order establishes a Committee on Ocean Policy to coordinate ocean-related matters across various government departments and agencies. It aims to integrate environmental, economic, and security interests related to oceans and coasts. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt, as it focuses on coordination and policy advice rather than specific policy prescriptions. It doesn't directly address immigration. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by creating a new committee and tasking it with coordinating policy, but it also emphasizes cooperation with state and local governments. It doesn't directly impact national security vs. civil liberties. It doesn't seem to have a strong effect on economic regulation. It doesn't directly address social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are close to neutral.",
