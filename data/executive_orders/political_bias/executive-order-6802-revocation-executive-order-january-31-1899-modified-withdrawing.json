    "critique": "This executive order pertains to land use in Alaska, specifically revoking a previous order that reserved land for an agricultural experiment station and re-designating it for joint use by the Department of Agriculture and the Alaska Game Commission. Given the limited scope and focus on land management, the document does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, or national security. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism aspect is slightly tilted towards federal control, as it involves federal land management. Economic regulation is also slightly present due to the regulation of land use.",
