    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Charles Sheldon Antelope Range. It revokes a previous order to free up land, then withdraws that land from settlement to conserve wildlife and protect grazing lands. It establishes joint jurisdiction between the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture for wildlife and exclusive jurisdiction to the Secretary of Interior for grazing lands. It prioritizes forage for antelope and other wildlife, but allows for domestic livestock grazing as well. It does not seem to touch on immigration, executive power, or civil liberties. It has a slight tilt toward conservation, which could be seen as slightly liberal. It also centralizes control of the land in the federal government.",
