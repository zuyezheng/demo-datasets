    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the withdrawal of public lands in Wyoming for use as a stock driveway. It modifies previous executive orders to enable the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw lands for this specific purpose. Given the limited scope and focus on land management, the document has minimal implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
