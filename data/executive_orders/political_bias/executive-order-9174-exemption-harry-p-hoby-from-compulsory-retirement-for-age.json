    "critique": "This is an executive order that makes an exception to the mandatory retirement age for one individual, Harry P. Hoby. It does not seem to have any implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power, as it is a specific exception made by the president, but the effect is minimal.",
