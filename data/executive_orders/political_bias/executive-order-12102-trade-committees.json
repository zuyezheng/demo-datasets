    "critique": "This document is an executive order that adjusts the membership of the Trade Policy Committee and the East-West Foreign Trade Board. It replaces the Assistant to the President for Economic Affairs and the Executive Director of the Council on International Economic Policy with the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also removes a name from the East-West Foreign Trade Board. These are administrative changes that do not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
