    "critique": "This document establishes agencies and procedures for implementing the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935. It focuses on work relief programs during the Great Depression. Ideologically, it leans liberal due to government intervention in the economy and social welfare programs. There's no direct impact on immigration. It expands executive power by creating new agencies and granting them broad authority. It centralizes power at the federal level. It balances security and liberty. It involves heavy government intervention in the economy. It promotes social inclusion by providing relief to those in need.",
