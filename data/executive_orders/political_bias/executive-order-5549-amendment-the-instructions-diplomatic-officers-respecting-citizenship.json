    "critique": "The document primarily concerns the delegation of citizenship-related instructions to diplomatic officers, referencing Article X of the Consular Regulations. It doesn't express strong opinions on the axes. The document itself doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral.",
