    "critique": "This document establishes civil service classifications for certain positions within the Indian service. It mandates that individuals in these roles pass a civil service examination to ensure competence and qualifications. The document does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The document could be seen as slightly expanding federal control by standardizing hiring practices across the Indian service.",
