    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to review the selective service system. It aims for fairness and considers various factors like military needs, individual careers, and economic conditions. There's no strong indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, or a shift in federalism. It seems balanced in terms of national security vs. civil liberties. It doesn't directly regulate the economy or promote specific social inclusion policies. Therefore, most scores are neutral. However, the establishment of a commission by the President could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power.",
