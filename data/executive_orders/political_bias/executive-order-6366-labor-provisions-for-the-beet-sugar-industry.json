Executive Power: The document expands executive power (+3) as it demonstrates the President's authority to approve and order labor provisions based on the National Industrial Recovery Act.\n4.  Federalism: The document leans towards federal primacy (+2) as it involves the federal government setting labor standards for an industry, indicating a centralization of control.\n5.

Economic Regulation: The document strongly favors government intervention (+4) in the economy by approving labor provisions for an entire industry, showcasing significant regulatory oversight.\n7.
