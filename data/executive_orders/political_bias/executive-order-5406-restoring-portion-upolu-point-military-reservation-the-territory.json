    "critique": "This document pertains to the transfer of land in Hawaii between the US military and the Territory of Hawaii for aeronautical purposes. It is a very specific administrative action with minimal implications for broad political issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism aspect is slightly tilted towards federal control as it involves federal land being managed in a territory.",
