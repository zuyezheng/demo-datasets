    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts Frank Shoenfield from compulsory retirement for one year. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of this document as it is a specific case. It does not seem to have any implications for immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The executive power is slightly expanded as the president is making an exception to a rule.",
