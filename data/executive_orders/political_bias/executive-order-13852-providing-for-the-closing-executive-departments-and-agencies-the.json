    "critique": "This document is an executive order to close all federal government departments and agencies on December 5, 2018, as a mark of respect for George Herbert Walker Bush. It is a symbolic gesture of respect for a former president. There is nothing in the document that suggests a particular ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion or restriction of executive power, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation implications or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
