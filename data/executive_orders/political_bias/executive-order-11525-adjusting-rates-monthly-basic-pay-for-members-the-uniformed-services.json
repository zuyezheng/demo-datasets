    "critique": "This document is an executive order from President Nixon adjusting the pay for members of the uniformed services. It seems primarily administrative in nature. There's no clear indication of a liberal or conservative ideological tilt. It doesn't address immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. It does have a slight impact on economic regulation by adjusting pay, but it's a fairly neutral adjustment.",
