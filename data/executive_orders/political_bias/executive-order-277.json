    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1906 regarding the use of funds to transport unemployed US citizens from Panama back to the United States. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt without more context, but it seems to be a pragmatic response to a specific situation. Immigration is not directly addressed, but the order facilitates the return of US citizens. Executive power is somewhat expanded as the President is given discretion in how to use the funds. Federalism is not a major factor, but the order implies federal responsibility for citizens abroad. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly relevant. Economic regulation is minimal, but the order does involve government spending. Social inclusion is not a primary concern, but the order benefits a specific group of citizens.",
