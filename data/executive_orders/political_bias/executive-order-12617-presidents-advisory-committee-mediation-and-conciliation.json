    "critique": "This document extends the life of the President's Advisory Committee on Mediation and Conciliation. This seems like a fairly neutral action. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, shift in federalism, impact on national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be around 0.",
