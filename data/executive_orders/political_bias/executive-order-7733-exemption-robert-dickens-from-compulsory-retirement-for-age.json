    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1937 exempting a specific government employee from mandatory retirement. It's a very specific action with limited broader implications. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on a left-right spectrum. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in general, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that might be relevant is executive power, but even there, it's a very narrow use of existing authority granted by Congress. The order itself does not expand executive power, but rather uses a power already granted. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
