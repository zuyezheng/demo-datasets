    "critique": "This document adjusts the rates of basic pay and salaries for various government employees, including those in the General Schedule, Foreign Service Schedule, Department of Medicine and Surgery, Senior Executive Service, uniformed services, the Vice President, the Executive Schedule, Congress, and the Judiciary. It does not touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It could be argued that adjusting pay for federal employees slightly expands federal power, but it is primarily an administrative action. There is a very slight intervention in the economy by adjusting wages.",
