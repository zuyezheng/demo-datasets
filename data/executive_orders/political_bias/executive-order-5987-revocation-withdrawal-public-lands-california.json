    "critique": "This document is an executive order that revokes a previous executive order withdrawing public lands for use by the Department of Commerce as air mail beacon sites and landing fields. The revocation only affects specific lands in California. Because the document simply revokes a previous order regarding land use, it has very little bearing on the axes of political bias. It is primarily an administrative action.",
