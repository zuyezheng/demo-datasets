    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the delegation of authority related to foreign assistance and international security. It amends previous executive orders to reflect changes in legislation and to clarify responsibilities among the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and the Administrator of the Agency for International Development. There's no direct indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. The document doesn't seem to expand executive power significantly, but rather refines existing delegations. It doesn't directly address federalism or economic regulation. There's no clear impact on social inclusion either. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
