    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to develop recommendations regarding US-Japan relations. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The order itself doesn't expand executive power, but it does create a commission under the President's authority, so a slightly positive score might be considered. However, the order also specifies that the Secretary of State will handle administrative functions, which could be seen as a slight restraint on executive power.",
