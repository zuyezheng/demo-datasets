    "critique": "This executive order exempts the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) from the Federal Labor-Management Relations Program. This action could be seen as slightly conservative as it potentially reduces the power of labor unions within this specific government entity. It doesn't directly impact immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties in a major way, economic regulation significantly, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight nudge towards conservative on the ideological tilt.",
