    "critique": "This document is a revocation of Lancaster, Minnesota, as a customs port of entry. This seems like a fairly neutral action. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power grab, federalism shift, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation changes, or social inclusion implications. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
