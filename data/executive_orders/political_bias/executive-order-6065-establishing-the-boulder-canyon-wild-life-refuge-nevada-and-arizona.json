    "critique": "This document establishes the Boulder Canyon Wild Life Refuge. It is focused on conservation and environmental protection. It restricts certain activities like hunting and destruction of property within the refuge. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes will be neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the environmental focus.",
