    "critique": "This executive order focuses on establishing a National Garden of American Heroes and revises a previous order on the same topic. It aims to counter what it describes as 'anti-American extremism' and the desecration of historical monuments. The order lists a wide range of individuals to be honored with statues in the garden. The language used is highly patriotic and emphasizes American exceptionalism. It also directs funding towards the project and requires public reporting on its progress. The selection of heroes includes a mix of historical figures, politicians, artists, and athletes, which attempts to represent a broad spectrum of American society, though the initial framing is conservative.",
