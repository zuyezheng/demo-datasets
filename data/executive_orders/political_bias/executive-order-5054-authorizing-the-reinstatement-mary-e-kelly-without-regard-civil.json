It appears to be a compassionate decision based on her late husband's service and her need for support. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism concerns, national security vs. civil liberties issues, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 0.",
