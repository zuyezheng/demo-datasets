    "critique": "This document establishes an interim director for the Selective Service System. Given this, the ideological tilt is likely neutral. The document does not address immigration. The document expands executive power by designating an individual to perform duties, but this is a temporary measure. The document does not directly address federalism. The document does not directly address national security vs. civil liberties. The document does not directly address economic regulation. The document does not directly address social inclusion.",
