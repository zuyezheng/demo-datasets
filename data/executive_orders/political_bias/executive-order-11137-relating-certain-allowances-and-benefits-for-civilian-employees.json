    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the compensation and allowances for civilian employees of the U.S. armed forces working in foreign areas and certain nonforeign areas. It delegates authority to the Secretaries of military departments and the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations governing these payments. There is nothing about ideological tilt, immigration, security vs liberty, or social inclusion. It is mostly an administrative action. It does delegate some authority away from the president, which is a slight restraint on executive power. It also seems to give more power to the federal government, and involves government intervention in the economy.",
