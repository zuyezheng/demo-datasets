It details the service's operational parameters, including the scope of delivery, vehicle markings, scheduling, contact points within government buildings, and limitations on article size. The document does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral.",
