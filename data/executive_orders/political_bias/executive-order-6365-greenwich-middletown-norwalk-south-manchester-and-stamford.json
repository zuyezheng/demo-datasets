    "critique": "This document is an executive order that abolishes several customs ports of entry in Connecticut. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores are neutral. There might be a slight shift towards federal control as it centralizes customs operations, but it's minimal.",
