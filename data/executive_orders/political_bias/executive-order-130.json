    "critique": "This document is a standard diplomatic authorization from 1899, granting John Hay, the Secretary of State, the power to negotiate with Germany and Britain regarding the Samoan Islands. It reflects the executive branch's authority to conduct foreign policy. There's no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or domestic issues like economic regulation or social inclusion. The document doesn't expand executive power beyond standard diplomatic practice, nor does it significantly impact federalism or national security vs. civil liberties. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
