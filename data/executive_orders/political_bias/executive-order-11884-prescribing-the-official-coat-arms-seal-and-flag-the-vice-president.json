    "critique": "This executive order establishes the official coat of arms, seal, color, and flag of the Vice President of the United States. It revokes a previous executive order (No. 10016) from 1948. There is no direct impact on immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order primarily concerns government symbols and organizational structure. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. There's a very slight increase in executive power due to the act of creating these symbols via executive order, but it's minimal.",
