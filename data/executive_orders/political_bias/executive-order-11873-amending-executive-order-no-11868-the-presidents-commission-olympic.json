    "critique": "This document amends a previous executive order regarding the composition of a commission. It increases the number of members and includes members appointed by the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. This suggests a move towards greater inclusivity and balance of power. There is no information related to immigration, security vs liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion, so those axes should be neutral. The inclusion of congressional appointments suggests a slight restraint on executive power and a cooperative balance between state and federal power. The ideological tilt is likely neutral as it simply modifies the composition of a commission.",
