    "critique": "This document adjusts rates of pay and allowances for various government employees and members of the uniformed services. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The act of adjusting pay could be seen as a very slight intervention in the economy, but it's primarily an administrative function.",
