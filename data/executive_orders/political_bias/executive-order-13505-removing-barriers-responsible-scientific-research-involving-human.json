    "critique": "This document promotes stem cell research, which is often supported by those with more liberal views. The order itself doesn't directly deal with immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion beyond the specific issue of stem cell research. Therefore, most of these axes should be neutral. The revocation of previous executive orders could be seen as slightly limiting executive power in the long run, as it prevents the continuation of a previously established policy. However, it also uses executive power to enact a new policy, so it's a bit of a wash.",
