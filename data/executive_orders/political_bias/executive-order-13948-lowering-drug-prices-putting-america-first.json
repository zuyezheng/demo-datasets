    "critique": "The document advocates for government intervention in drug pricing to lower costs for Americans, particularly through Medicare. It aims to align drug prices with those in other developed countries, which suggests a focus on economic regulation and social welfare. There is no direct mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, or social inclusion, so those axes are scored as neutral. The document seems moderately liberal due to its interventionist approach to healthcare costs.",
