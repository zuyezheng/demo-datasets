    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the administration of the Foreign Service. It delegates certain functions to the Secretary of State, establishes salary classes, and creates a Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service. It also allows the Secretary of State to request information from the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of Veterans Affairs. There is nothing in this document to suggest any ideological tilt, immigration approach, or social inclusion stance. It seems to be a fairly standard administrative order. It does delegate some authority to the Secretary of State, but this does not seem to be a significant expansion of executive power. It also seems to maintain the existing balance between the federal government and the states. There is nothing to suggest any prioritization of national security over civil liberties, or vice versa. Finally, there is nothing to suggest any deregulation or intervention in the economy.",
