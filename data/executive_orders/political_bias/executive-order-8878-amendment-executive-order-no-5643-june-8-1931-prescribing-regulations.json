    "critique": "This document pertains to post allowances for government employees working abroad and amends a previous executive order on the same topic. It grants the Secretary of State discretion over these allowances. Given the limited scope and focus on internal administrative matters, the document does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The slight increase in the Secretary of State's discretion could be interpreted as a very minor expansion of executive power, but it's minimal.",
