    "critique": "This executive order establishes an interagency group to address policies concerning Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. It seems fairly neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion. It could be argued that it slightly expands federal control by creating this interagency group, but it also emphasizes consultation with local governors, which balances this effect. It does not seem to expand executive power significantly, as it mainly focuses on coordination and advice.",
