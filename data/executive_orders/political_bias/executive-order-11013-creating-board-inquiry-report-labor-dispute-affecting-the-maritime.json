    "critique": "This document is an executive order creating a Board of Inquiry to address a labor dispute in the maritime industry. It invokes the authority of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947. The order itself doesn't directly express ideological leanings, immigration stances, or preferences regarding federalism or social inclusion. It's primarily focused on resolving a labor dispute that affects national health and safety. The creation of the board could be seen as a form of government intervention in the economy, but it's a measured response to a specific situation. There's no indication of prioritizing national security over civil liberties or vice versa. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight lean towards government intervention in the economy.",
