    "critique": "This executive order establishes the order of succession within the Department of Justice. It is a routine administrative action that does not directly address issues of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The order revokes a previous order, which could be seen as a slight shift in executive power, but it's minimal.",
