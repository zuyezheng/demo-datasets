    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1937 that establishes an addition to the St. Marks Migratory Bird Refuge in Florida. It designates specific lands and waters for the Department of Agriculture's use, subject to existing rights. The order references the Migratory Bird Conservation Act. There is no information about immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, these axes should be scored as neutral. The document does not contain any overt ideological slant.",
