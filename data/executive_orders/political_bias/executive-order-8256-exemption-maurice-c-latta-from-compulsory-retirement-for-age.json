    "critique": "The document is an executive order that exempts a White House employee from mandatory retirement. It does not seem to touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it may have some bearing on is executive power, but the action is very limited and specific, so it doesn't seem to expand executive power in a significant way. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0).",
