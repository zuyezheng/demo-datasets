    "critique": "This document pertains to the internal operations of the US Civil Service Commission in 1888, specifically regarding the filling of positions within the Hydrographic Office of the Navy. It requests presidential approval to include certain positions under noncompetitive examination rules due to the specialized nautical education required and the remote locations of the offices. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. The document does not directly address immigration. It could be argued that granting the executive branch the ability to fill positions non-competitively expands executive power, but this is a very minor effect. The document does not significantly impact federalism. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. The document has a very minor impact on economic regulation. The document does not directly address social inclusion.",
