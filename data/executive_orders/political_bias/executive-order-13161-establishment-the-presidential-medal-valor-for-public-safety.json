    "critique": "This document establishes the Presidential Medal of Valor for Public Safety Officers. It recognizes public safety officers who have shown extraordinary valor. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. However, it could be argued that recognizing law enforcement leans slightly towards prioritizing national security.",
