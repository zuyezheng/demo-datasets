    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1937 regarding the retirement age of a civil engineer. It allows an exception to be made to continue his service. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis with a potential score is executive power, as it allows the President to make an exception. However, this power is explicitly granted by law, so it's not necessarily an expansion of executive power beyond what was already legislated. Therefore, a neutral score seems appropriate for most axes.",
