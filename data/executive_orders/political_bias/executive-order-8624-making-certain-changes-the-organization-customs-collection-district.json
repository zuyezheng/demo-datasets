    "critique": "This document is an executive order that changes the organization of Customs Collection District No. 26 (Arizona). It revokes the designation of Ajo, Arizona, as a customs port of entry and designates Sonoyta, Arizona, as a customs port of entry. This seems like a fairly routine administrative action with minimal political implications.\n\n*   **Ideological Tilt:** 0 (Centrist/Moderate) - This action doesn't reflect any particular ideological leaning.\n*   **Immigration Approach:** 0 (Balanced/Selective) - While it deals with customs, it doesn't inherently restrict or open immigration.\n*   **Executive Power:** 0 (Neutral/Balanced) - It's a standard executive order, not significantly expanding or restricting executive power.\n*   **Federalism:** 0 (Cooperative Balance) - It involves federal control over customs, but it's within the established framework.\n*   **National Security vs. Civil Liberties:** 0 (Balanced Approach) - It doesn't directly impact national security or civil liberties.\n*   **Economic Regulation:** 0 (Moderate Regulation) - It's related to customs and trade, but it's a minor adjustment.\n*   **Social Inclusion:** 0 (Neutral) - It has no impact on social inclusion.\n\nRevised scores:\n*   **Ideological Tilt:** 0\n*   **Immigration Approach:** 0\n*   **Executive Power:** 0\n*   **Federalism:** 0\n*   **National Security vs. Civil Liberties:** 0\n*   **Economic Regulation:** 0\n*   **Social Inclusion:** 0",
