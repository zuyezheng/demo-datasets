    "critique": "This document is an executive order transferring control of San Nicholas Island from the Department of Commerce to the Secretary of the Navy, with a reservation for the Department of Commerce to maintain aids to navigation. This appears to be a simple administrative matter with minimal political implications. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's a slight shift towards federal control, but it's not significant enough to warrant a high score.",
