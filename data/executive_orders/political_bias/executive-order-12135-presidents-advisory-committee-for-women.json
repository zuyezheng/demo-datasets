It promotes social inclusion and equality for women, aligning with liberal values. There is no emphasis on restricting liberties or expanding executive power. The document does not explicitly address economic regulation, immigration, or federalism, so those scores are neutral. The committee is temporary, concluding its work by 1980.",
