    "critique": "This document is a military order assigning Major-General John M. Schofield to command of the Army of the United States. It is a short, factual statement with no explicit political content. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. The only axis that might have a slight lean is Executive Power, as it is an order from the President, but it's a routine military assignment, so it's not a significant expansion.",
