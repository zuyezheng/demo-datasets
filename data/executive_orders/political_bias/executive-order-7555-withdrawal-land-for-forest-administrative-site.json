    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding land use in California. It revokes a previous order and withdraws a tract of land for use by the Forest Service. There is minimal ideological content. It's difficult to assess its impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion without further context. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
