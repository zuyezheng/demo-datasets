    "critique": "This document establishes a Board of Inquiry to address labor disputes in the maritime industry. It invokes Section 206 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947, to address a strike that is deemed to imperil the national health and safety. The document itself doesn't directly express a strong ideological tilt, but the invocation of the Labor-Management Relations Act suggests a moderate approach to economic regulation, as it provides a framework for government intervention in labor disputes. Immigration is not directly addressed. The creation of the board doesn't dramatically expand executive power, but it does utilize existing legal authority to intervene in a labor dispute, so it is slightly expansionary. Federalism is not a primary concern here. National security is invoked as a justification for intervention, but civil liberties are not explicitly curtailed. Social inclusion is not directly addressed. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration: 0, Executive Power: 1, Federalism: 0, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 1, Economic Regulation: 1, Social Inclusion: 0. Upon further reflection, the invocation of national health and safety does suggest a slightly stronger emphasis on national security, and the intervention in a labor dispute, while not extreme, leans slightly towards government intervention in the economy. The executive power score is appropriate because it is using existing authority, not creating new authority.",
