    "critique": "This document is an executive order that amends a previous executive order (No. 11609) regarding regulations for agencies under 5 U.S.C. 5724c. Specifically, it addresses the authority to prescribe regulations for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The amendment stipulates that the Director of Central Intelligence, after consulting with the Administrator of General Services, shall prescribe these regulations for the CIA. This appears to be a technical adjustment related to agency responsibilities and doesn't directly address broad ideological or political issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism aspect is slightly tilted towards federal control as it clarifies the authority of a federal agency (CIA).",
