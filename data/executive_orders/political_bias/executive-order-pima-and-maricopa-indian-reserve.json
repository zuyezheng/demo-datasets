    "critique": "This executive order from 1883 expands an existing reservation for the Pima and Maricopa Indians. This action, while seemingly beneficial to the tribes, also reflects the historical context of the US government's control over Native American lands and lives. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on a modern left-right spectrum, but given the era, it leans slightly towards a more conservative approach of managing indigenous populations rather than respecting their sovereignty. Immigration is not directly addressed. Executive power is expanded by setting aside land. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is making decisions about land use. National security vs. civil liberties is not a major factor, but the act does impact the liberties of settlers who might have wanted to claim the land. Economic regulation is minimal. Social inclusion is complex; it includes the tribes but also excludes others.",
