    "critique": "This document is an executive order to close government departments for Memorial Day. It is a simple act of respect for fallen soldiers. There is no clear ideological tilt, immigration stance, impact on executive power, federalism implications, or bearing on national security vs. civil liberties. It doesn't regulate the economy or address social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
