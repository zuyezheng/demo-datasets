    "critique": "This is an executive order that waives civil service rules for a specific individual, William R. Benham, to be appointed to a position in the Department of Justice. The order is based on the Civil Service Act and is recommended by the Attorney General. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that seems relevant is executive power, as the order allows an exception to standard hiring procedures.",
