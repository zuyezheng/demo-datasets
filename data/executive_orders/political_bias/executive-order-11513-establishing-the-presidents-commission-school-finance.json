    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to study school finance. It does not directly address immigration, national security, or civil liberties. It has a slight impact on federalism by creating a federal commission, and a slight impact on economic regulation by studying school finance. It is moderately liberal in that it seeks to improve public education and consider the needs of non-public schools. It is neutral on social inclusion.",
