    "critique": "This executive order focuses on strengthening the relationship between the federal government and Native American tribal governments. It emphasizes tribal self-determination, economic development, healthcare access, and protection of tribal lands and cultures. It establishes the White House Council on Native American Affairs to coordinate federal programs and resources for tribal communities. The order does not directly address immigration, executive power, or economic regulation in a way that would strongly skew the scores. It leans towards federal involvement and social inclusion.",
