    "critique": "This document is an executive order that adjusts the placement of positions within the Executive Schedule. It moves the Counselor on Legislative and Intergovernmental Policy, Department of the Treasury to level IV and removes Assistant Attorney General, United States Attorneys and Trial Advocacy, Department of Justice from Section 1-101 (f). This action appears to be primarily administrative and has minimal impact on the axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
