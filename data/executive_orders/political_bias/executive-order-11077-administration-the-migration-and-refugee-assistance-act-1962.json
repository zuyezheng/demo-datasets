    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the administration of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962. It primarily delegates responsibilities to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. There is a slight expansion of executive power through the delegation of authority and waivers of certain regulations to expedite aid. The document itself doesn't explicitly address ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a direct or overt manner. Therefore, most scores are neutral, with a slight lean towards expanding executive power.",
