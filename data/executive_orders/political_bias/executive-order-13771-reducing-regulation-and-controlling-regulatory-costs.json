    "critique": "This executive order aims to reduce the cost of regulations by requiring that for every new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process. This suggests a move towards deregulation and a reduction in government intervention in the economy. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes should be neutral. The ideological tilt is conservative, as deregulation is generally a conservative goal. The economic regulation score is strongly deregulatory.",
