    "critique": "This document is an executive order that removes a position from Level V of the Executive Schedule. It amends a previous executive order (12154) by removing the subsection related to the Executive Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Department of Labor. The action seems administrative in nature, re-organizing the executive schedule. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's a very slight move toward deregulation by removing a position related to pension benefits, but it's minimal.",
