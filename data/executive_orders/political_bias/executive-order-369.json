It mandates that all communications intended for the executive department must be transmitted through the relevant department. This seems to be an effort to streamline communication and ensure that all matters are handled by the appropriate personnel. There is no indication of ideological bias, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, all scores are set to 0.",
