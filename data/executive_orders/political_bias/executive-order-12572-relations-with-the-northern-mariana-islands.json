    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the administrative relationship between the United States and the Northern Mariana Islands. It assigns general administrative supervision to the Secretary of the Interior for matters not already under the purview of other federal departments or agencies. Given the limited scope and focus on administrative structure, the document's ideological tilt is neutral. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that would warrant a strong positive or negative score. The document seems to maintain a cooperative balance between the federal government and the Northern Mariana Islands, without significantly shifting power dynamics. Therefore, most axes are scored as neutral (0).",
