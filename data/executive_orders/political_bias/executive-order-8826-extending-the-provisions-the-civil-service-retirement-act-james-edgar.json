    "critique": "This document is an executive order extending the Civil Service Retirement Act to three employees of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It does not touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The act of extending retirement benefits could be seen as a very slight intervention, but it's minimal.",
