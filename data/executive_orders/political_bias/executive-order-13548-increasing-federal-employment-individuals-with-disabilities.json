    "critique": "This executive order aims to increase the employment of individuals with disabilities within the Federal Government. It directs agencies to develop plans, set goals, and implement strategies for recruitment, hiring, and retention. It also emphasizes the importance of retaining those injured on the job and improving return-to-work outcomes. The order itself doesn't seem to strongly lean left or right ideologically, but it does promote social inclusion and government intervention in employment practices. It also seems to expand executive power by directing agencies to take certain actions. It doesn't touch on immigration, security vs. liberty, or federalism in any significant way. The economic regulation aspect is moderate, as it encourages the government to act as a model employer.",
