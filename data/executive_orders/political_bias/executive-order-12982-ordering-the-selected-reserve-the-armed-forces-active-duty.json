    "critique": "The document expands executive power by authorizing the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation to order active duty for military units and individual members of the Selected Reserve. It does not explicitly address economic regulation, social inclusion, immigration, or ideological tilt. The order is focused on national security and operational effectiveness in former Yugoslavia, potentially at the expense of civil liberties due to the expansion of executive power.",
