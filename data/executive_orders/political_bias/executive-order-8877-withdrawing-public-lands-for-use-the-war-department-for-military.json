    "critique": "This executive order withdraws public lands in Alaska for use by the War Department for military purposes. It does not seem to have any direct implications for ideological tilt, immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It arguably expands executive power by withdrawing lands, but this is a fairly standard function. It centralizes control of these lands under the federal government, impacting federalism. It also prioritizes national security by reserving land for military use.",
