    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the expansion of the National Advisory Committee for Women. It increases the number of members that the President can appoint to the committee. This suggests a slight increase in executive power, as the President has more appointments to make. It also promotes social inclusion by expanding a committee for women. There is no direct impact on immigration, federalism, national security, or economic regulation. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the focus on women's issues.",
