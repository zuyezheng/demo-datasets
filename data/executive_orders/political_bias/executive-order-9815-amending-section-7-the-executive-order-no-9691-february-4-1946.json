    "critique": "This document pertains to internal government management and civil service employment. It amends a previous executive order regarding Schedule A positions, which are exceptions to competitive civil service status. The amendment clarifies the conditions under which individuals can continue in employment under Schedule A after a general revision, specifying that the position must be included under the revised Schedule A, and that the section does not apply to positions filled by persons having a classified civil service status. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion/exclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
