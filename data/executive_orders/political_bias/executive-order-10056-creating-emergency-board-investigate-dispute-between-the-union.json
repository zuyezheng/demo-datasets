    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between a railroad company and its employees. It seems to be a fairly neutral intervention to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. It doesn't strongly lean liberal or conservative, nor does it touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. It does involve government intervention in a labor dispute, but not to a heavy degree.",
