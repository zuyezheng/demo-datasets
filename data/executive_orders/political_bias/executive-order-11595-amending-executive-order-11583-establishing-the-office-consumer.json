    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Office of Consumer Affairs in the Executive Office of the President. It outlines the appointment and compensation of the Director and Deputy Directors. It doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. However, by creating an office within the Executive Office, it could be argued that it slightly expands executive power and potentially leans towards government intervention in consumer affairs, although the impact is minimal. The original scores reflect a neutral stance on most axes, with a slight lean towards expanding executive power and intervention.",
