    "critique": "This executive order provides medical benefits to retired and active duty officers/crew members of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and their dependents. It defines who is eligible for treatment and the extent of treatment they are entitled to. It also specifies that charges will be made for hospitalization of dependent members of families. It amends a prior executive order to conform to the provisions of this order. There is nothing particularly liberal or conservative about providing medical benefits to government employees and their families. It does expand the role of the federal government in providing healthcare, but it is a very specific group of people. It does not seem to touch on civil liberties, immigration, or federalism. It does not seem to promote or discourage diversity or inclusion.",
