    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the transfer of land between two national forests, Rainier and Wenatchee, under the authority of the act of June 4, 1897. It redefines boundaries based on hydrographic divides and previous proclamations and executive orders. The order explicitly states that it does not intend to change the national-forest status of any lands. Given the subject matter, the document has very little ideological content. Most axes should be close to neutral. The federalism axis might lean slightly towards federal control, as it involves the federal government managing national forests, but it's a routine administrative action. There's no clear impact on civil liberties, immigration, or social inclusion. Economic regulation is indirectly affected through land management, but not significantly. Executive power is used to enact the transfer, but it's based on existing legislation, so it's not a major expansion.",
