    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to study and make recommendations on whether the US should provide financial compensation to US nationals held captive abroad. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. However, the creation of a commission and potential for government compensation could be seen as a slight intervention, and the focus on compensating hostages could be seen as a slight emphasis on social inclusion.",
