    "critique": "This document designates two international organizations as public international organizations, granting them certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities under the International Organizations Immunities Act. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The act of designating international organizations could be seen as a slight move towards international cooperation, but it's not significant enough to warrant a strong score on any particular axis.",
