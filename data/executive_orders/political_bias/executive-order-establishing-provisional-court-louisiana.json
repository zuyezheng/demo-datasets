    "critique": "The document expands executive power by establishing a provisional court under presidential authority during military occupation. It centralizes federal control by appointing a judge and other officers, overriding state judicial institutions. The order prioritizes security and order over civil liberties in the context of insurrection. There is no clear indication of economic regulation, immigration approach, ideological tilt or social inclusion.",
