    "critique": "This executive order establishes a board to study and make recommendations on communications policy. It seems fairly neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by creating a new board, but it also directs cooperation from other agencies, suggesting a collaborative approach. It also centralizes communications policy at the federal level, suggesting a slight increase in federal power.",
