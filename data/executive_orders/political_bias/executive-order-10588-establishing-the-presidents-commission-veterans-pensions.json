    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to study veterans' pensions and related benefits. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It delegates authority to the commission, so it doesn't greatly expand executive power. It also doesn't seem to shift power between state and federal governments. It has a slight interventionist bent due to the study of benefits, but it's not a strong one. It doesn't directly address social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
