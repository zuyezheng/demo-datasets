    "critique": "This document is a delegation of authority from the President to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management and Budget). It concerns the allocation of funds appropriated by Congress for management improvement across the executive branch. It's a fairly technical and procedural matter with minimal direct impact on the axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's a slight increase in executive power due to the delegation, but it's not a major shift.",
