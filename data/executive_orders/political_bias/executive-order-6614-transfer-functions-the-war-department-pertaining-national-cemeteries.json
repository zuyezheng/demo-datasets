    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the transfer of administrative functions related to national cemeteries and memorials in Europe from the War Department to the American Battle Monuments Commission. It invokes the authority of the President under the act of March 3, 1933, to reorganize the executive branch. The order revokes a previous order transferring these functions to the Department of State and transfers them instead to the American Battle Monuments Commission. It also addresses the transfer of personnel, records, supplies, equipment, and unexpended balances of appropriations. The order includes a provision for delaying the effective date if the President deems it necessary for economic reasons.",
