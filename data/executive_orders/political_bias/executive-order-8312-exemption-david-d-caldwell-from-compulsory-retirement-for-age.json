    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1939 that exempts an attorney from mandatory retirement for one year. It is difficult to assess its position on the traditional left-right political spectrum. There is no mention of immigration. The document expands executive power by exempting someone from compulsory retirement. There is no clear indication of federalism. There is no clear indication of national security vs. civil liberties. There is no clear indication of economic regulation. There is no clear indication of social inclusion.",
