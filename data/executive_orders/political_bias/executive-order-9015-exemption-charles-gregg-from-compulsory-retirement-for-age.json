    "critique": "This is an executive order that exempts Charles Gregg from compulsory retirement for one year. It is a very specific and narrow action. It does not seem to have any broad implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it touches on is executive power, as it is an exercise of the President's authority to make exceptions to retirement rules. However, it is a fairly minor expansion of executive power, as it only affects one individual and is for a limited time.",
