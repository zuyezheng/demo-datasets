    "critique": "This executive order withdraws public lands in Colorado for use as War Department camp sites. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order does allocate land for military use, which could be interpreted as a slight increase in federal control, but it's primarily an administrative action.",
