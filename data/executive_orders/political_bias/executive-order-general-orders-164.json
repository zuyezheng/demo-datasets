    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the aftermath of the Lincoln assassination and the pursuit of those involved, including Jefferson Davis. It revokes rewards for the arrest of certain other individuals. Given the historical context, several axes are essentially neutral. The ideological tilt is difficult to assess without more context, but given that it is after the civil war, and concerns the confederacy, a slight conservative tilt is assumed. Immigration is not relevant. Executive power is neutral, as is federalism. National security is a focus, but balanced with civil liberties considerations. Economic regulation is not relevant, nor is social inclusion.",
