    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending the Manual for Courts-Martial. It primarily concerns military justice and procedures. There's no direct indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or economic regulation. The order doesn't obviously expand executive power, as it's an amendment within existing legal frameworks. It doesn't directly impact federalism or the balance between national security and civil liberties. There's no clear impact on social inclusion either. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. However, the nature of military justice might lean slightly towards national security focus.",
