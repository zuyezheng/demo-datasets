    "critique": "This executive order re-establishes the Presidential Medal of Freedom and outlines the criteria for awarding it. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It expands the existing Distinguished Civilian Service Awards Board, but this seems more administrative than a significant shift in executive power. It doesn't obviously impact federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
