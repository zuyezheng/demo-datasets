    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the structure and reporting lines of the Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB). It modifies Executive Order 12863, clarifying that the IOB is a standing committee of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) and reports directly to the President. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order slightly expands executive power by centralizing intelligence oversight within the President's direct purview. It has a neutral impact on federalism and national security vs. civil liberties.",
