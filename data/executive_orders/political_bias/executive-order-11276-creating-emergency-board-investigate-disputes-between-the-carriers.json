    "critique": "This document is an executive order by President Lyndon B. Johnson invoking the Railway Labor Act to address a dispute between air carriers and their employees. It establishes a board to investigate the disputes and prevent any changes to the conditions out of which the disputes arose for a period of thirty days. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order seems neutral in these aspects. The only axis with a slight lean is executive power, as the president is creating a board and intervening in a labor dispute, which could be seen as a slight expansion of executive authority.",
