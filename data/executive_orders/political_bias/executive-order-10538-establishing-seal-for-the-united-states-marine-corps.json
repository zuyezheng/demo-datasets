    "critique": "This document is an executive order approving the official seal for the United States Marine Corps. It is primarily a symbolic and administrative action with minimal direct impact on the axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's no indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power shift, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion/exclusion. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards national security/unity due to its military focus, but this is very marginal.",
