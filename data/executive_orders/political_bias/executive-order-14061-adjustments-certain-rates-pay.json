    "critique": "This document primarily deals with setting the pay scales for various government employees, including those in the statutory pay systems, senior executive service, executive, legislative, and judicial branches, uniformed services, and administrative law judges. It also addresses locality-based comparability payments. There is nothing about immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It does not obviously expand executive power, nor does it obviously favor the states or the federal government. It does not obviously regulate or deregulate the economy. It is difficult to assign a strong ideological leaning to this document. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
