    "critique": "This document pertains to the Canal Zone Postal Service and sets regulations for interest payments on postal-savings certificates. It's a very specific and localized economic matter with minimal impact on broader political or social issues. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The economic regulation aspect is slightly interventionist, but not significantly so.",
