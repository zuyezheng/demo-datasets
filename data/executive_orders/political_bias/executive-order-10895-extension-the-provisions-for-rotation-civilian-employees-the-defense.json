    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the assignment of employees to duty in Alaska or Hawaii. It stipulates that such assignments should be considered as assignments outside the United States for the purposes of section 1586 of title 10 of the United States Code. The order also directs the Secretary of Defense to review the need for continuing the order annually and recommend revocation when advisable. There is nothing to suggest any ideological tilt. There is nothing about immigration. The order delegates responsibility to the Secretary of Defense, but it does not expand executive power in any meaningful way. It does not relate to federalism. It does not relate to national security or civil liberties. It does not relate to economic regulation. It does not relate to social inclusion.",
