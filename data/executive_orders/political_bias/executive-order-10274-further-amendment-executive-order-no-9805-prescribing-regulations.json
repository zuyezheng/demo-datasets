It primarily concerns logistical and administrative matters. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, or impact on federalism. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 0.",
