    "critique": "This executive order establishes a reservation for the Coeur d'Alene Indians. This action suggests a recognition of indigenous rights and a degree of government intervention to protect their land. However, the historical context is important: such reservations were often established after displacement and conflict, and the order itself doesn't address broader issues of tribal sovereignty or self-determination. The exclusion of the Coeur d'Alene Mission lands is also notable. Given this, I will score it as follows:\n\n*   Ideological Tilt: +1 (Slightly Liberal - recognition of indigenous rights)\n*   Immigration Approach: 0 (Neutral - not directly related to immigration)\n*   Executive Power: 0 (Neutral - establishes a reservation, but within existing territorial boundaries)\n*   Federalism: +1 (Slightly Federal - federal government setting aside land within a territory)\n*   National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0 (Balanced - no clear impact on either)\n*   Economic Regulation: +1 (Slightly Interventionist - withdrawing land from sale implies some economic control)\n*   Social Inclusion: +2 (Moderately Inclusive - sets aside land for a specific group, though within a context of historical injustice)",
