    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on energy efficiency in federal buildings and operations. It aims to reduce energy consumption, minimize petroleum use, and promote the procurement of energy-efficient goods and alternative-fueled vehicles. There is a moderate level of government intervention in economic regulation to achieve energy efficiency goals. The document does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes are set to neutral.",
