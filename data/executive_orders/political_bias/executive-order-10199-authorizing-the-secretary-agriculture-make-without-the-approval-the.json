    "critique": "The document delegates authority to the Secretary of Agriculture, which could be seen as a slight shift towards federal control. However, it's primarily an administrative action related to existing agricultural legislation. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power expansion, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation changes, or social inclusion implications.",
