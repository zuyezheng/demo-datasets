    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the service-in-grade requirements for officers in the Marine Corps. It temporarily suspends certain provisions of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. It does not seem to have any implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order supersedes a previous executive order, but this does not necessarily indicate an expansion of executive power.",
