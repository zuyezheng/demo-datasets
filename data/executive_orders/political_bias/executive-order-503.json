    "critique": "This document concerns the redrawing of the boundaries of the White Mountain or San Carlos Indian Reservation in the Territory of Arizona, restoring a portion of that land to the public domain. Given that this reduces the size of reservation land, it arguably leans towards prioritizing the interests of non-indigenous settlers or the federal government over those of the indigenous population. This could be seen as a conservative approach in the historical context of westward expansion and federal Indian policy. There is no information about immigration, executive power, security/liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The federal government is exerting its power over the state.",
