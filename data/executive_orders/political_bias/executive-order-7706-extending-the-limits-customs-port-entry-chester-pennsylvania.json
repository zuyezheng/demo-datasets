    "critique": "This document is an executive order that expands the limits of the customs port of entry of Chester, Pennsylvania. It does not seem to have any ideological tilt, immigration implications, impact on executive power, or implications for national security vs. civil liberties. It also does not seem to have any impact on economic regulation or social inclusion. The only axis that it seems to have any impact on is federalism, as it is a federal action that affects the boundaries of a customs port of entry. I will score it as slightly favoring federal control.",
