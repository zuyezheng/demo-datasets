    "critique": "This document is a delegation of authority from the President to the Secretary of State regarding reporting requirements for loans and credits to the Polish People's Republic. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The delegation itself doesn't inherently expand or restrict executive power, but it does streamline the process, so I will give a slightly positive score. The act of delegating to the Secretary of State suggests a slight move away from federal control, so I will give a slightly negative score for federalism.",
