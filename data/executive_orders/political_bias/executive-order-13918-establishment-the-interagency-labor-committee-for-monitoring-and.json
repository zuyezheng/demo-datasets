    "critique": "This executive order establishes an interagency committee to monitor and enforce labor obligations under the USMCA agreement with Canada and Mexico. It aims to ensure that Canada and Mexico adhere to their labor commitments and that Mexico continues its labor reform. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. However, it does touch on economic regulation by monitoring labor standards and potentially recommending enforcement actions. The order seems neutral in terms of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, and social inclusion. It has a slight leaning towards government intervention in the economy to ensure fair labor practices. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration: 0, Executive Power: 0, Federalism: 0, National Security: 0, Economic Regulation: 2, Social Inclusion: 0. After further consideration, the economic regulation aspect is more about ensuring existing agreements are followed, not necessarily new intervention. Thus, I will revise the economic regulation score to 1. The final scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration: 0, Executive Power: 0, Federalism: 0, National Security: 0, Economic Regulation: 1, Social Inclusion: 0.",
