    "critique": "This document is an executive order that amends a previous executive order regarding appeals from decisions of the Auditor General of the Philippines. It primarily concerns administrative and procedural changes, specifically modifying deadlines and updating the names of government entities involved. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. The changes seem neutral in terms of executive power, federalism, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are set to 0 across all axes.",
