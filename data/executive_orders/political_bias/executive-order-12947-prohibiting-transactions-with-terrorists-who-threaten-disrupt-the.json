    "critique": "This executive order, issued by President Clinton in 1995, declares a national emergency in response to violence disrupting the Middle East peace process. It blocks the property and interests of individuals and entities found to be involved in such violence. The order grants broad authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to implement these measures, including issuing regulations and redelegating functions. It also coordinates investigations with the FBI. The order invokes the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the National Emergencies Act. It does not create any enforceable rights against the United States. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of this document. It is not explicitly liberal or conservative. It is more focused on national security. The order restricts transactions with certain individuals and entities, which could be seen as economic intervention, but it is in the context of national security. The order does not directly address immigration. It does expand executive power by declaring a national emergency and granting broad authority to the Secretary of the Treasury. It does not directly address federalism or social inclusion. It does prioritize national security over civil liberties by blocking assets and restricting transactions.Initial scores:Ideological Tilt: 0Immigration Approach: 0Executive Power: 3Federalism: 0National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 3Economic Regulation: 2Social Inclusion: 0Revised scores:Ideological Tilt: 0Immigration Approach: 0Executive Power: 3Federalism: 0National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 3Economic Regulation: 2Social Inclusion: 0",
