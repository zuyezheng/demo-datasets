    "critique": "This document is a waiver related to trade with Bulgaria. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt based on this document alone, but the act of waiving trade restrictions could be seen as slightly liberal in the context of international relations. Immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, and social inclusion are not directly addressed. The economic regulation aspect is slightly towards deregulation as it waives trade restrictions.",
