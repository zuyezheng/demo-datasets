    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a labor dispute and prevent disruption of interstate commerce. It seems fairly neutral regarding ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, and social inclusion. It could be argued that it leans slightly towards economic intervention by creating a board to resolve a labor dispute, but it's a fairly moderate intervention.",
