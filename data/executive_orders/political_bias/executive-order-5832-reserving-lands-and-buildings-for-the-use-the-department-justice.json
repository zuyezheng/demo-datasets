    "critique": "This document is a land reservation for the Department of Justice. It's a fairly mundane administrative action with little bearing on the typical axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's no indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power grab, federalism shift, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion issues. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards federal power since it's a presidential order concerning federal land, but it's minimal.",
