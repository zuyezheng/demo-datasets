    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 allocating funds to the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. Given the context of the Great Depression and the New Deal, this would be considered a liberal policy. The order itself doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. However, it does represent government intervention in the economy. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 4, Immigration: 0, Executive Power: 0, Federalism: 0, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0, Economic Regulation: 4, Social Inclusion: 0. Upon further reflection, the allocation of funds could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, so I will adjust that score. Also, while the document doesn't directly address social inclusion, the emergency relief could be seen as a step towards helping a diverse population during the depression, so I will adjust that score slightly.",
