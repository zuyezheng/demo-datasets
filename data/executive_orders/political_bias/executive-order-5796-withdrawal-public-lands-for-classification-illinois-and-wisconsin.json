    "critique": "The document focuses on land withdrawal for classification and legislation, indicating a moderate level of government intervention in land management. It doesn't directly address social issues, immigration, or executive power, so those scores are neutral. The emphasis on federal control over public lands suggests a leaning towards federalism.",
