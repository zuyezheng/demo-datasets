    "critique": "This document is an executive order that adjusts positions in levels IV and V of the Executive Schedule. It moves the Commissioner on Aging from one section to another, deletes the Transition Manager position, and reletters subsections. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
