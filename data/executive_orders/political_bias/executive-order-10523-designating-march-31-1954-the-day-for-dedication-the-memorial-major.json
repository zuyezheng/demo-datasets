    "critique": "This document is a presidential order designating a day for the dedication of a memorial and excusing federal employees in the Panama Canal Zone from duty on that day. It commemorates Major General George W. Goethals and the construction of the Panama Canal. There is minimal ideological content. The order does expand executive power slightly by designating a holiday for federal employees, but this is a minor action. It centralizes authority in the federal government, specifically concerning federal employees and a federal territory (Canal Zone). There is no mention of national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral.",
