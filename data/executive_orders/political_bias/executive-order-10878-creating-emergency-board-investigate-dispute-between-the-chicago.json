    "critique": "This document pertains to a labor dispute in the railroad industry and the creation of a board to investigate it. It invokes the Railway Labor Act. Given the nature of the document, most axes are not strongly implicated. There's a slight interventionist aspect in creating a board and preventing changes to conditions, but it's within an established legal framework. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power beyond what's legally defined, federalism implications, or prioritization of national security over civil liberties. The document seems neutral regarding social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
