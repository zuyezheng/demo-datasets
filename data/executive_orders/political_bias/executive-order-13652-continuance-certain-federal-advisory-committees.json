    "critique": "This executive order primarily focuses on the continuation and amendment of various advisory committees. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. The changes to executive power and federalism are minimal, mainly concerning administrative functions and committee structures. There's no significant impact on economic regulation or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with slight adjustments for the administrative nature of the order.",
