    "critique": "The document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between Pan American World Airways and its employees, represented by the Transport Workers Union of America. It aims to prevent interruption of interstate commerce and essential transportation services. The order is neutral in ideological tilt, immigration, security vs. liberty, economic regulation and social inclusion. It can be seen as expanding executive power by creating a board and intervening in a labor dispute. It also leans towards federal control as it involves a federal intervention in a dispute.",
