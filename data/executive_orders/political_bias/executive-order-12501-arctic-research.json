    "critique": "This document establishes the Arctic Research Commission and the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee. It aims to coordinate Arctic research efforts across federal agencies, academic institutions, and private industry, including indigenous residents of the Arctic. There is an emphasis on cooperation with the State of Alaska. The document itself doesn't directly address issues of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that would strongly suggest a bias. The focus is on research and coordination. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The federalism aspect leans slightly towards federal control due to the establishment of federal committees and the coordination of research efforts at the federal level, but it also emphasizes cooperation with the State of Alaska, so it's not a strong shift.",
