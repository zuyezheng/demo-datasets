    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous order (12916) regarding the Border Environment Cooperation Commission and the North American Development Bank. It designates the Secretary of the Treasury to coordinate policies related to the Board, aiming to improve internal management. There's no indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, or a shift in federalism. It doesn't directly address national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
