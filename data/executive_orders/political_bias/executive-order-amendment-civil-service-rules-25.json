    "critique": "The document pertains to adding positions (fish culturists and machinists in the Commission of Fish and Fisheries) to the list of places subject to noncompetitive examination under civil service rules. This seems like a fairly neutral administrative action. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
