    "critique": "This document is about standardizing the language used in formal documents such as proclamations and commissions. It aims to restore a form that prevailed from the time the Government was established, promoting uniformity across departments. There is a slight tilt towards tradition, but overall, the document appears neutral regarding ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion.",
