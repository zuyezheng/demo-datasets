    "critique": "This document pertains to an amendment to the Civil Service Rules related to the Bureau of the Census and special agents collecting cotton statistics. It revokes a paragraph in Schedule B of the Civil Service Rules and adds a paragraph to Schedule A. Given the limited scope and specific nature of the document, it's difficult to assign strong scores on most axes. The changes seem administrative in nature.",
