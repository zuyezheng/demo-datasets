    "critique": "This document primarily concerns trade regulations and delegation of authority within the executive branch. It does not directly address social issues, immigration, or civil liberties. Therefore, many of the axes will be neutral. The focus is on centralizing trade-related functions under the Special Representative, indicating a slight shift towards federal control in this specific area.",
