    "critique": "This document is an amendment to an executive order regarding the payment of expenses related to the death of certain civilian officers and employees. It specifies what costs are allowable for the preparation of remains and sets a limit of $150. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power dynamics, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
