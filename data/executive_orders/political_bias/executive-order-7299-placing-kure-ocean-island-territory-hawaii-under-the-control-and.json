    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 that places Kure Island under the control of the Secretary of the Navy for naval purposes. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It has a slight impact on federalism by centralizing control of the island under the federal government. It doesn't seem to have any economic or social inclusion implications. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards federal control.",
