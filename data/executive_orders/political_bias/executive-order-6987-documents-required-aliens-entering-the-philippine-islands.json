    "critique": "This executive order from 1935 concerns immigration requirements for the Philippine Islands. Given the historical context, several factors influence the scoring. The order outlines documentary requirements (passports, visas) for entry, suggesting a selective approach to immigration, but also includes exceptions and waivers, indicating some flexibility. The specific mention of 'Chinese' suggests potential discriminatory practices, though it also notes that special laws and regulations may govern their entry. The order grants discretion to the Governor General to waive requirements in certain cases, indicating a degree of executive power. The order also delegates authority to officials in Panama Canal Zone, American Samoa and Guam. Given that the Philippines was a US territory at the time, the federal government is exerting control. The mention of public safety suggests a concern for national security. Overall, the document seems moderately conservative in its approach to immigration and national security, while also granting some discretionary power to executive figures.",
