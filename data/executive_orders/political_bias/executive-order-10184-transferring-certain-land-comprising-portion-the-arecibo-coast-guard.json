    "critique": "This document is a transfer of land from the US government to the Insular Government of Puerto Rico. It does not touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does relate to federalism, as it involves the transfer of land from the federal government to a local government. Because Puerto Rico is a territory, this transfer represents a slight shift towards state control, but not a major one.",
