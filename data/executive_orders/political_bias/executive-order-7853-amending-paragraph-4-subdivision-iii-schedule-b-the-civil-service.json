It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order seems to be an administrative adjustment to classify certain positions within the civil service, specifically within the Bureau of Air Commerce. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
