    "critique": "This is an executive order that makes an exception to a rule about mandatory retirement age for a government employee. It does not seem to have any implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it seems to touch on is executive power, as it is an example of the president using their power to make an exception to a rule. However, the act of congress explicitly allows the president to do this, so it is not really an expansion of executive power.",
