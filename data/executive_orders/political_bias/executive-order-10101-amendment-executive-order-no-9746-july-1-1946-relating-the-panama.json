    "critique": "This document pertains to the administration and operation of the Panama Canal. It primarily deals with organizational structure, lines of authority, and administrative procedures within the Canal Zone. Given its focus on governance and internal management, the document has limited implications for broader ideological or political issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The shift from 'Secretary of War' to 'Secretary of the Army' is purely administrative and doesn't reflect a change in policy or ideology.",
