    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the expansion of the Waubay Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in South Dakota. It designates specific lands for the Department of Agriculture's use, subject to existing rights and future acquisitions. Given the subject matter, the document has minimal implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
