    "critique": "This executive order establishes a Presidential Advisory Council on the Peace Corps. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It has a slight impact on executive power by creating an advisory council, but it's not a significant expansion. It doesn't seem to have a major impact on federalism or economic regulation. It could be seen as promoting social inclusion by supporting the Peace Corps, which often works on international development and cultural exchange.",
