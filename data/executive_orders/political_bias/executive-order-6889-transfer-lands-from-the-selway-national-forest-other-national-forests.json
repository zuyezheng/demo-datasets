    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that transfers land between national forests in Idaho. It does not seem to have any significant ideological tilt, immigration implications, or impact on civil liberties. It does not expand executive power beyond the authority already vested in the president. It shifts control of land between different national forests, which could be seen as a slight shift towards federal control, but it's primarily an administrative matter. There is no economic regulation or social inclusion aspect to this document. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
