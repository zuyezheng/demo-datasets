    "critique": "This document is a delegation of authority from the President to the Secretary of Defense regarding the discharge of enlisted members of the armed forces. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It has a neutral stance on economic regulation and social inclusion. The order delegates authority, so it neither expands nor restricts executive power significantly. It does not obviously shift power between the federal and state governments.",
