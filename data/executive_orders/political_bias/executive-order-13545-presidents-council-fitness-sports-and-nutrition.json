    "critique": "This executive order focuses on promoting fitness, sports, and nutrition through a national program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. It establishes the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition to advise the President and the Secretary on these matters. The order emphasizes public awareness, coordination between public and private sectors, and targeting all Americans, especially children and adolescents. It also mentions adherence to the Federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. There is nothing explicitly ideological about this document. It does not touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any significant way. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There is a slight tilt towards government intervention in promoting public health, but it's minimal.",
