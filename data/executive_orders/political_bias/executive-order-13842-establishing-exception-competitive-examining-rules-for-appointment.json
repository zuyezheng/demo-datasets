    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the hiring and conversion authorities within the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS). It aims to streamline the hiring process for Deputy U.S. Marshals and Criminal Investigators by placing them in Schedule B of the excepted service, allowing for non-competitive conversion to career appointments after three years of satisfactory service. There is no direct impact on ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order seems neutral in these aspects. The executive power is slightly expanded by giving more flexibility to the USMS in hiring, but it is limited and subject to existing laws and regulations.",
