    "critique": "This document establishes regulations for granting annual leave to civilian officers and employees of the United States government. It defines terms like \"accumulated leave\" and \"current annual leave,\" outlines eligibility criteria, and specifies how leave is accrued and charged. There is nothing particularly ideological about this document. It seems mostly neutral. There's no clear indication of prioritizing national security over civil liberties, or vice versa. The document doesn't seem to expand executive power significantly; it mainly clarifies existing regulations. It doesn't directly address immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
