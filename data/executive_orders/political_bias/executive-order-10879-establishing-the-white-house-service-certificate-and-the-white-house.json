    "critique": "This executive order establishes a White House Service Certificate and Badge for military personnel detailed to duty in the White House. It seems largely ceremonial and administrative in nature, with minimal impact on the axes of political bias. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
