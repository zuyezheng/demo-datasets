    "critique": "This executive order outlines the standards and guidelines for selecting US District Judges. It emphasizes character, experience, ability, and commitment to equal justice. It encourages the use of commissions to identify qualified candidates, including women and minorities. The order itself doesn't explicitly lean heavily on any particular ideological stance. It promotes a fair and reasonable selection process. It doesn't expand executive power significantly, but rather provides guidelines for the Attorney General and the President. It doesn't directly address immigration, national security, economic regulation, or federalism. It promotes social inclusion by encouraging the identification of qualified candidates, including women and members of minority groups.",
