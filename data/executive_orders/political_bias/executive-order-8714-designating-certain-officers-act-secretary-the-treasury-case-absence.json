    "critique": "This document is a simple executive order that establishes a line of succession within the Department of the Treasury. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It slightly expands executive power by clarifying the line of succession, but this is a very minor effect.",
