    "critique": "This executive order directs federal agencies to use the metric system in their procurements, grants, and other business-related activities to the extent economically feasible. It establishes an Interagency Council on Metric Policy (ICMP) to coordinate the transition and requires agencies to develop metric transition plans. The order aims to implement the congressional designation of the metric system as the preferred system for U.S. trade and commerce. There is little ideological content. Immigration, security/liberty, and social inclusion are not relevant. The order does not obviously expand executive power, but it does centralize authority in the Department of Commerce. It could be seen as a form of economic intervention, though a very mild one.&#x20;",
