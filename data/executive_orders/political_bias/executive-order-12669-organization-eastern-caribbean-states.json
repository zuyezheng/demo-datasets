    "critique": "This document is a designation of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States as a public international organization, which allows it certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. It does not seem to strongly lean in any particular ideological direction. It has a slight impact on immigration, as it may facilitate some international cooperation. It doesn't expand executive power significantly, nor does it greatly affect federalism or national security vs. civil liberties. It has a negligible impact on economic regulation and social inclusion.",
