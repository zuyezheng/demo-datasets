    "critique": "This document describes the addition of land to the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt without knowing the specific context and motivations behind this decision, but it appears to support the rights and needs of Native Americans. Immigration is not directly addressed. Executive power is somewhat expanded as the order sets aside land. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government is making decisions about land use. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly addressed. Economic regulation is not directly addressed. Social inclusion is promoted by supporting the Fort Mojave Indians.",
