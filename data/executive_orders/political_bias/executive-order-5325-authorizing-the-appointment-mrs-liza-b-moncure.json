    "critique": "This document is a short executive order that waives civil service rules for Mrs. Liza B. Moncure, the widow of a prohibition agent, to allow her to be appointed to a classified position in the Treasury Department. It is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. The order seems to be a specific case to support the widow of a fallen agent. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
