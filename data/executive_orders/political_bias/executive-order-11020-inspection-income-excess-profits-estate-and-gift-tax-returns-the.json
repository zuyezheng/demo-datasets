    "critique": "This document is an executive order that allows the Senate Committee on Armed Services to inspect tax returns from 1946 to 1962. It is related to an investigation of strategic and critical materials. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power changes, federalism implications, economic regulation, or social inclusion. However, the allowance of inspection of tax returns could be seen as a slight move towards prioritizing national security, but it is a stretch. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
