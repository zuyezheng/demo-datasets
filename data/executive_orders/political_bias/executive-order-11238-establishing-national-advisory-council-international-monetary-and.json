    "critique": "This document establishes a temporary advisory council on international monetary and financial problems. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation in a direct manner, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The establishment of a council could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's temporary and advisory, so the impact is minimal.",
