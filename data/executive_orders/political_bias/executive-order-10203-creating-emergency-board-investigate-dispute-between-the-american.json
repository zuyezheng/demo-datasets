    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a labor dispute between American Airlines and its employees. It does not seem to obviously lean in any particular ideological direction. It seems to be a fairly standard intervention in a labor dispute. It does not obviously expand executive power, but uses existing authority. It does not obviously relate to federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of these are set to zero.",
