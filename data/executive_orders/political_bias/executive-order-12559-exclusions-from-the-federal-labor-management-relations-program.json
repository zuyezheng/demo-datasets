    "critique": "This executive order removes certain agencies within the Department of Justice (DEA and US Marshals) from the Federal Labor-Management Relations Program. This action could be seen as slightly conservative as it potentially limits the power of labor unions within these agencies. It doesn't directly impact immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion significantly. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
