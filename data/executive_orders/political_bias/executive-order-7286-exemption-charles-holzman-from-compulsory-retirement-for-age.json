    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1936 exempting a specific person from mandatory retirement. It is a very specific action with minimal broader implications. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that is relevant is executive power. The order uses existing executive authority to make an exception, so it slightly expands executive power, but only in a very limited, case-by-case way.",
