It extends the period for which temporary clerks, carriers, and laborers can be employed for part-time or intermittent work in the Postal Service. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
