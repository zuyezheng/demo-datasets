    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1942 authorizing the Secretary of War to issue citations for outstanding performance of duty in action to units of the US Army and the Army of the Philippine Commonwealth. It also describes the use of streamers and devices to denote these citations. There is nothing in the document that suggests a particular ideological tilt. It is a wartime measure, so it is difficult to assess its impact on immigration. It expands executive power slightly by authorizing the Secretary of War to issue citations. It does not directly address federalism. It prioritizes national security during wartime. It does not directly address economic regulation. It does not directly address social inclusion, although it does mention the Army of the Philippine Commonwealth.",
