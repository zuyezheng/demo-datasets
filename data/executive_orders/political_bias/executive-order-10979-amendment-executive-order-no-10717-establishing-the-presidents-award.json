    "critique": "This document outlines an amendment to Executive Order No. 10717, focusing on the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service. It emphasizes improvements in government operations, public service, creative solutions, courage, scientific/technological achievements, leadership, and career service. The amendment details the selection process, nomination procedures, and criteria for the award. There is no direct mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes are neutral. The emphasis on government service and presidential authority suggests a slight lean towards expanding executive power.",
