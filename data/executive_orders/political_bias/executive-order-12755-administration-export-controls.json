    "critique": "This document pertains to the amendment of an existing executive order (12002) regarding export administration. It primarily focuses on the composition and responsibilities of the Export Administration Review Board. The changes involve adding the Secretary of Energy and the Director of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency as members for specific issues, and including 'concerns about the nonproliferation of armaments' as a consideration. Given the subject matter, the document has minimal implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The changes do not significantly expand executive power, as they mainly concern the structure of a review board. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
