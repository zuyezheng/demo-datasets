    "critique": "This document extends the application of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to areas outside the US where the Federal Government has jurisdiction under international agreements. It mandates consultation with the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, ensuring no conflict with international treaties or national defense. There is nothing explicitly ideological in this document. It seems to be a fairly standard administrative action. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's a slight increase in executive power due to the order itself, and a slight increase in federal power as it extends federal aviation regulations.",
