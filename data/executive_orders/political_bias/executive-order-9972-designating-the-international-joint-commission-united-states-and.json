    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on international agreements and organizational immunities, with no clear indication of bias across the specified axes. It establishes the International Joint Commission as a public international organization, entitling it to certain privileges and immunities. The order does not express opinions on immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial and revised scores are neutral across all categories.",
