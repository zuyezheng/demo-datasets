    "critique": "This document is an authorization from the President to the Secretary of State to perform functions related to international agreements regarding environmental enhancement, specifically concerning water pollution control. It delegates presidential authority to another government official. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis with a clear direction is executive power, where the document seems to restrain executive authority by delegating it.",
