It involves the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion/exclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
