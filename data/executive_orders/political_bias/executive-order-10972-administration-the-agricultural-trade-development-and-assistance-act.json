    "critique": "The document is a short executive order amending a previous executive order. It removes a paragraph related to loans and section 104(e) of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1934. Because it is such a specific change to existing policy, it is difficult to assess the political bias across the typical axes. However, some assumptions can be made. Given it is an executive order, it likely expands executive power. Given the nature of the order, it likely has little impact on immigration, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Because it relates to agricultural trade, it may have a slight impact on federalism.",
