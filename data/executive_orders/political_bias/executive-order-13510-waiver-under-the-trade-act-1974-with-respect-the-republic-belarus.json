    "critique": "This document is a waiver related to trade with Belarus. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt without more context, but the act of waiving trade restrictions could be seen as slightly liberal in the sense of promoting international cooperation. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is somewhat expanded as the President is enacting a waiver. Federalism is not directly impacted. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly addressed. Economic regulation is slightly reduced as trade restrictions are waived. Social inclusion is not directly addressed.",
