    "critique": "This document pertains to the National Industrial Recovery Act, specifically the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Funeral Supply Industry. Given the context of the Great Depression and the New Deal, the document likely reflects a liberal approach to economic regulation. There is no information related to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Therefore, those axes should be scored as neutral. The document explicitly references government intervention in the economy through the approval of a code of fair competition, suggesting a move away from laissez-faire economics.",
