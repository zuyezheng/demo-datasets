    "critique": "This document pertains to the National Industrial Recovery Act, which was a New Deal program. Therefore, it likely has a liberal ideological tilt and involves government intervention in the economy. There is no information about immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion, so those should be neutral. The document seems to expand executive power, as it is an executive order approving a code of fair competition.",
