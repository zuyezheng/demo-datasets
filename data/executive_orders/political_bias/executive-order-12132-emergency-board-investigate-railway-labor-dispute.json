    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between the National Railway Labor Conference and its employees. It is based on the Railway Labor Act. There is nothing particularly liberal or conservative about this. It does not deal with immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. It does involve economic regulation in the sense that it prevents changes to the conditions out of which the dispute arose, but this is a temporary measure.",
