    "critique": "This document is an executive order transferring jurisdiction over certain lands in New Mexico from the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the Interior, to be administered by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the benefit of designated Indians. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. However, it does shift control of land from one federal agency to another, indicating a slight increase in federal control. The order appears to be aimed at better managing land resources for the benefit of Native American tribes, which could be seen as a positive step towards social inclusion, although it's a very indirect effect. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight positive score for federalism and social inclusion.",
