    "critique": "This document primarily concerns amendments to the Selective Service Regulations, focusing on procedural aspects of appeals and handling delinquent registrants. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, or social inclusion. The changes appear to streamline administrative processes within the Selective Service System. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism axis is slightly positive as it reinforces the federal government's role in the draft.",
