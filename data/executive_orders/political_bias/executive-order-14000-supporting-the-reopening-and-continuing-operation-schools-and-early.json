    "critique": "This document is an executive order focused on ensuring high-quality education during the COVID-19 pandemic. It directs the Secretaries of Education and Health and Human Services to provide guidance and support to schools, child care providers, and institutions of higher education. It also encourages the FCC to increase connectivity options for students lacking reliable home broadband. The order emphasizes the health and safety of students, educators, and communities, and aims to mitigate learning loss and address educational disparities. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that would warrant a strong score. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the focus on addressing educational disparities and inequities.",
