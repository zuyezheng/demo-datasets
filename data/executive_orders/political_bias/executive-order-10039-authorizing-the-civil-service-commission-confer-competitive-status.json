    "critique": "The document is an executive order that confers competitive status upon a specific employee, Miss Winifred R. Donnellon, in the United States Passport Agency, Department of State. It cites the Civil Service Act and Revised Statutes as the legal basis for this action. The order notes that Miss Donnellon has been employed by the Department of State for over 27 years and would have been eligible for competitive status under noncompetitive procedures had she remained in her previous position. This document appears to be a specific personnel action rather than a broad policy statement. Therefore, most of the axes are neutral. The only axis that might have a slight lean is social inclusion, as it provides an opportunity for an employee to advance.",
