    "critique": "This document establishes the Missouri River Basin Commission, in accordance with the Water Resources Planning Act. It defines the commission's jurisdiction, membership, functions, and duties. It also addresses international coordination and reporting to the President. There is no immediately obvious ideological tilt. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is somewhat expanded, as the President appoints the chairman. Federalism is complex, as it involves both federal and state members. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly addressed. Economic regulation is moderately involved, as it deals with water resources. Social inclusion is not directly addressed. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration: 0, Executive Power: 1, Federalism: 1, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0, Economic Regulation: 1, Social Inclusion: 0. Upon further reflection, the federalism score should be higher, as the commission is established at the request of the states but ultimately reports to the President through the Water Resources Council, indicating a stronger federal role. The executive power score is also slightly higher, as the President appoints the chairman and receives reports through the Water Resources Council.",
