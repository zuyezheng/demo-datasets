    "critique": "This document extends the life of several advisory committees and revokes some executive orders related to terminated committees. There's nothing inherently liberal or conservative in this action. It seems mostly administrative. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The extension of the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee might suggest a slight tilt towards national security, but it's not significant enough to warrant a high score. Similarly, the inclusion of committees related to arts and humanities and mental retardation suggests a slight tilt towards social inclusion, but again, not significant.",
