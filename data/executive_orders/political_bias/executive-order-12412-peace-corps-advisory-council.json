    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Peace Corps Advisory Council. It is a fairly standard administrative action, so most of the scores should be neutral. The creation of an advisory council does give the executive branch more advice and potentially more power, but it is not a significant expansion. The Peace Corps itself is generally seen as a positive program that promotes international understanding and cooperation, which could be seen as slightly liberal. There is no mention of immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion, so those should be neutral.",
