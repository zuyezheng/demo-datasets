    "critique": "This executive order from 1962 outlines the responsibilities of the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) in preparing for national emergencies, including potential attacks on the United States. It focuses on ensuring the readiness of civil airports, aviation facilities, services, and aircraft. The order emphasizes cooperation with the Department of Defense and other agencies, resource assessment, and the development of emergency plans. It also clarifies that the authority to implement these plans is reserved for the President. There is nothing explicitly ideological in the document. It seems to be a fairly standard emergency preparedness plan. Immigration is not mentioned. The order delegates authority to the FAA administrator, but also reserves authority for the president, so it is hard to say whether it expands or restricts executive power. It seems to strike a balance between federal and state control, so it is hard to say whether it expands or restricts federalism. It focuses on national security, but does not seem to infringe on civil liberties. It does not seem to have any impact on economic regulation. It does not seem to have any impact on social inclusion.",
