    "critique": "This executive order deals with the termination of the Economic Stabilization Program and the Cost of Living Council in 1974. It delegates remaining authority to the Secretary of the Treasury for the orderly termination of the program and establishes the President's Committee on Food. There is nothing about immigration or civil liberties. The order seems to be winding down economic intervention, so it is slightly deregulation. It is neither particularly liberal nor conservative. It does delegate power to the Secretary of Treasury, but it is for the purpose of winding down a program, so it is not really expanding executive power. It is mostly neutral on social inclusion and federalism.",
