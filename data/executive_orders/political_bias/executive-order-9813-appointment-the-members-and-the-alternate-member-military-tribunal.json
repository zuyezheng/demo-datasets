    "critique": "This document establishes a military tribunal in occupied Germany after WWII to try major war criminals. It is signed by the President. Here's a breakdown of the scores:\n\n*   **Ideological Tilt:** (0) - The document itself doesn't lean heavily left or right. It's a legal and administrative action related to war crimes tribunals.\n*   **Immigration Approach:** (0) - Immigration is not relevant to this document.\n*   **Executive Power:** (0) - While it's an executive order, it's implementing existing agreements and laws related to the occupation of Germany and the prosecution of war criminals. It doesn't drastically expand or restrict executive power beyond what's necessary for this specific context.\n*   **Federalism:** (0) - Federalism isn't directly addressed. The order deals with international agreements and military occupation, not the balance of power between the federal government and the states.\n*   **National Security vs. Civil Liberties:** (0) - While it deals with war crimes, the document focuses on establishing a legal process (tribunal) rather than broadly expanding national security powers at the expense of civil liberties. The creation of tribunals suggests an attempt to provide some legal framework, even in the context of war crimes.\n*   **Economic Regulation:** (0) - Economic regulation is not relevant to this document.\n*   **Social Inclusion:** (0) - Social inclusion is not relevant to this document.\n\nRevised Scores:\nGiven the above considerations, the initial scores seem appropriate. No revisions are necessary.",
