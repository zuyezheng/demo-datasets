    "critique": "This document is an executive order transferring enforcement functions related to equal pay and age discrimination from the Department of Labor to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). It seems to promote social inclusion and potentially economic regulation through enforcement of equal pay. There is no direct impact on immigration, executive power, or federalism. The order does not directly address national security or civil liberties. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:\n\n*   Ideological Tilt: +3 (Slightly Liberal due to focus on equality and anti-discrimination)\n*   Immigration Approach: 0 (Neutral)\n*   Executive Power: 0 (Neutral - merely a transfer of functions)\n*   Federalism: 0 (Neutral)\n*   National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0 (Neutral)\n*   Economic Regulation: +2 (Slightly Interventionist due to equal pay enforcement)\n*   Social Inclusion: +3 (Promotes equality and anti-discrimination)\n\nUpon further reflection, the transfer of power to the EEOC could be seen as a slight expansion of federal power, so the federalism score could be slightly positive. Also, while the order itself doesn't expand executive power, it does facilitate the enforcement of laws related to economic regulation and social inclusion, which could be seen as a slight increase in executive influence in these areas. The revised scores are as follows:",
