    "critique": "This document is an executive order transferring land from federal military use to the Territory of Hawaii for a public school. It's a fairly technical document focused on land management. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration. It could be argued that transferring land back to the Territory of Hawaii slightly restrains federal power, but it's a minor effect. It doesn't directly impact national security vs. civil liberties. It doesn't directly regulate the economy. It doesn't strongly promote or discourage social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to neutral.",
