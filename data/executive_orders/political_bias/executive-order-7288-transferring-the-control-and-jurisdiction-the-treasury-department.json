    "critique": "This document is a transfer of land from the War Department to the Treasury Department for Federal building purposes. It does not touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, or civil liberties. It has a slight impact on federalism, as it consolidates federal control over the land. It also has a slight impact on economic regulation, as it enables the construction of a Federal building. There is no impact on social inclusion.",
