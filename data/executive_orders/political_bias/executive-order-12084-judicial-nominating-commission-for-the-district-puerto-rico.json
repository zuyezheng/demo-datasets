    "critique": "This executive order establishes a judicial nominating commission for the District of Puerto Rico. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by creating a commission appointed by the President, but it also introduces a layer of review for judicial nominations, which could be seen as a check. The order delegates some administrative functions to the Attorney General, which doesn't strongly indicate a shift in federalism. There's no direct economic regulation or social inclusion aspect to this order. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight lean towards expanding executive power.",
