    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 and designates the Displaced Persons Commission as the agency responsible for investigating and reporting on the eligibility of displaced persons and persons of German ethnic origin seeking admission into the United States. It also directs other government agencies to assist the Commission. There is nothing explicitly ideological about this, but the act itself is related to immigration. The order itself seems neutral on immigration, simply implementing the existing law. It centralizes authority within the Displaced Persons Commission, but doesn't dramatically shift federalism. It doesn't obviously impact national security or civil liberties. It doesn't seem to have any economic regulation implications. It also doesn't seem to strongly promote or discourage social inclusion; it focuses on implementing existing law regarding displaced persons.",
