    "critique": "This document primarily concerns amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial and the implementation of the Military Justice Act of 2016. It focuses on procedural and technical aspects of military law, specifying effective dates and ensuring that changes do not retroactively punish actions. There is no direct impact on immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document does not obviously expand or restrict executive power, but rather implements changes mandated by legislation. It also doesn't significantly alter the balance between federal and state control. The document appears neutral regarding civil liberties versus national security, focusing on legal procedures within the military justice system. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
