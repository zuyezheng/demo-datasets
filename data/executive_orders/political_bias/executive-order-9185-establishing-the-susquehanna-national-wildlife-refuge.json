It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a controversial way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The act of setting aside land could be seen as a slight expansion of federal power, but it's primarily for conservation.",
