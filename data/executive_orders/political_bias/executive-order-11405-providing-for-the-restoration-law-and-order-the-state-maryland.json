    "critique": "This document authorizes the Secretary of Defense to use the armed forces, including the National Guard, to disperse persons engaged in acts of violence and restore law and order. This is in response to domestic violence and disorder. It expands executive power, potentially infringes on civil liberties in the name of national security, and centralizes federal authority. There is no direct impact on immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is difficult to assess without knowing the specific context of the violence, but the response to domestic violence is generally considered a conservative approach.",
