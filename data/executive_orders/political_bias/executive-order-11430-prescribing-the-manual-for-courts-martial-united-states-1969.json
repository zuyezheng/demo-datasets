    "critique": "This document establishes the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969. It primarily concerns military justice and legal procedures within the armed forces. Given its focus on legal and procedural matters within the military, the document has a limited scope regarding broader political issues. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral. The document itself doesn't express a clear ideological tilt, immigration stance, or position on economic regulation. It also doesn't significantly alter the balance between national security and civil liberties or promote a specific view on social inclusion. The executive power is somewhat expanded as it is an executive order prescribing the manual.",
