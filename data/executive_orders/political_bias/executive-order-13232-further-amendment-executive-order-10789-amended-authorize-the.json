    "critique": "This document is a simple amendment to an existing executive order, adding the Department of Health and Human Services to the list of agencies with contracting authority related to national defense. It's a technical adjustment with minimal ideological content. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The executive power axis is slightly expanded as it broadens the scope of an existing order.",
