    "critique": "This document is a reinstatement order for a widowed former employee of the Los Angeles post office. It is difficult to assess most of the axes because the document is very specific and does not touch on broad policy issues. The only axis that seems relevant is social inclusion, as it pertains to supporting a woman and her children after the death of her husband. However, this is a very specific case and not a general policy, so the impact is minimal.",
