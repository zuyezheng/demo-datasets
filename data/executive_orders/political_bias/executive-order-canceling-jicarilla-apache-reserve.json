    "critique": "This executive order cancels a previous order that had set aside land in New Mexico as a reservation for the Jicarilla Apache Indians, restoring the land to the public domain. This action reduces the land available for Native Americans and could be seen as favoring westward expansion and resource exploitation over indigenous rights. It does not directly address immigration, executive power in general, or federalism. It has some implications for social inclusion and economic regulation.",
