    "critique": "The document pertains to the authorization and direction of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding submarine cable licenses. It centralizes authority within the FCC, requiring approval from the Secretary of State and assistance from other government entities. The order doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. However, it does expand federal control over communications infrastructure and vests authority in the executive branch through the FCC. Therefore, the initial scores reflect this centralization of power and federal control, with neutral scores for other axes.",
