    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the internal administration and hierarchy within the consular services. It establishes rules for determining the ranking officer in the absence of the principal officer and clarifies seniority among consular officers. There is no direct impact on ideological tilt, immigration, economic regulation, social inclusion, national security vs. civil liberties, or federalism. The document does not expand executive power; it simply provides a framework for internal governance within the consular service. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
