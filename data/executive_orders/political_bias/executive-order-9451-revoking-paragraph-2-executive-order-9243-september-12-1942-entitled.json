    "critique": "This document revokes a paragraph of a previous executive order related to priority classifications between executive departments and agencies. It's a relatively minor administrative change. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt, immigration component, or impact on civil liberties. It doesn't dramatically shift executive power or federalism. It seems to have a neutral impact on economic regulation and social inclusion. Therefore, initial scores should be close to zero across the board.",
