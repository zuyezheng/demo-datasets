    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that withdraws public lands in New Mexico from settlement, location, sale, entry, permit, or lease to control the supply and distribution of potash. Potash is a naturally occurring mineral that is used in fertilizer. The order is in aid of legislation. The order does not seem to have any ideological tilt. It is a resource management decision. The order does not deal with immigration. The order does not expand executive power because it is subject to existing laws and can be revoked by the President or Congress. The order does not seem to deal with federalism. The order does not deal with national security or civil liberties. The order involves government intervention in the economy by controlling the supply and distribution of potash. The order does not deal with social inclusion.",
