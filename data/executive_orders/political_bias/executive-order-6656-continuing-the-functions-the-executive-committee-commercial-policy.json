    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that pertains to the coordination of commercial policy. It establishes that the Executive Committee on Commercial Policy will continue to exercise its functions. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
