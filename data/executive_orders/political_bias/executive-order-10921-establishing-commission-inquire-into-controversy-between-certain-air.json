    "critique": "This document establishes a presidential commission to investigate labor disputes between flight engineers and pilots unions. It seems to be a fairly neutral action, focused on resolving a specific labor issue. There's no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, national security concerns, or social inclusion aspects. The economic regulation aspect is slightly present as it involves labor and job security, but it's not a strong intervention. Therefore, most scores should be around 0, with a slight nudge towards economic regulation.",
