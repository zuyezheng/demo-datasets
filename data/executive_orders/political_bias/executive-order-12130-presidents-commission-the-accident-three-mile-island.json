    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to investigate the Three Mile Island accident. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It delegates authority to the commission and relevant agencies, maintaining a balance between federal and state roles. There's a slight increase in government intervention through the investigation, but it's temporary and focused on a specific incident. The order aims to provide information to the public, which leans towards social inclusion by promoting transparency.",
