    "critique": "This executive order from 1936 sets regulations for quarters and subsistence allowances for enlisted men in various military and public health services. It specifies daily allowances based on duty location and travel status. There's no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or civil liberties concerns. It doesn't expand executive power, but rather implements existing legislation. It doesn't directly address federalism or social inclusion. The economic regulation aspect is minimal, setting allowance rates, but not a major intervention. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
