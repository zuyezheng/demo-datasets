    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding changes to customs field organization. It revokes the designation of Provincetown, Massachusetts, and Lewes, Delaware, as customs ports of entry, extends the limits of the customs port of entry of New London, Connecticut, and designates Pelican, Alaska, as a customs port of entry. These changes appear to be related to internal management of the government and do not directly relate to any of the axes of political bias. Therefore, the initial scores should be neutral across all axes.",
