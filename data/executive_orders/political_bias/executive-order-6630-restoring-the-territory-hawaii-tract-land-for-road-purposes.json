    "critique": "This document is a 1934 executive order transferring a small tract of land from a military reservation to the Territory of Hawaii for road construction. The land will revert back to military control if the road isn't built within a year or ceases to be used for road purposes. There's nothing inherently ideological here. It's a technical land transfer. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The federalism aspect is slightly tilted towards federal control as it involves the federal government transferring land to a territory, but it's a minor point.",
