    "critique": "This document pertains to the International Coffee Agreement and delegates presidential functions related to it to the United States Trade Representative. It mandates consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of State. Given the subject matter, the document has minimal impact on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to neutral.",
