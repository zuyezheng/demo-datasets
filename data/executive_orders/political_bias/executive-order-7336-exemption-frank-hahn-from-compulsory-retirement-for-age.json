    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1936 exempting a specific government employee from mandatory retirement. It's a very specific action with limited scope and doesn't touch on broad ideological or policy issues. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards executive power, as it's an executive order granting an exemption, but it's a very narrow application of existing law.",
