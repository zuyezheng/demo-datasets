    "critique": "This is a simple appointment order during the Hoover administration. It waives civil service rules for a specific individual, Miss Ann Halloran, to be appointed as a stenographer in the Veterans' Administration. The order is based on the recommendation of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs. There's no indication of broad ideological leaning, immigration policy, or significant impact on executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The waiver of civil service rules could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power in this specific instance, but it's very limited in scope. Given the limited information, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
