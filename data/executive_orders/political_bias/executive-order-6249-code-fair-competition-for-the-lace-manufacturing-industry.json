    "critique": "This document establishes a code of fair competition for the Lace Manufacturing Industry under the National Recovery Act. It involves government intervention in the economy through the approval and enforcement of industry-specific regulations. It also creates a committee with government-appointed members to oversee the industry, further indicating government involvement. There is no information related to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion, so those axes should be scored as neutral. The ideological tilt is moderately liberal due to the interventionist economic policies.",
