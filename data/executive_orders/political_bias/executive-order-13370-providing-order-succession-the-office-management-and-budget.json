    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the line of succession within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). It specifies the order in which officers of the OMB shall perform the functions of the Director if the Director and Deputy Director are unable to do so. It also clarifies exceptions, such as individuals serving in an acting capacity and the President's discretion to depart from the order. There is nothing about ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order seems neutral regarding these aspects. The order does not expand executive power, but rather clarifies the line of succession within an office. Therefore, it is neutral on that axis as well.",
