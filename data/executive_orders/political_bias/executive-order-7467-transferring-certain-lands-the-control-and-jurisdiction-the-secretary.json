    "critique": "This document is a transfer of land from the Army to the Navy. It is an executive order, but it does not expand executive power in any significant way. It is a technical document with no clear ideological tilt. It has no implications for immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It is related to national security in a very indirect way, but it does not prioritize national security over civil liberties. It is a transfer of land between two federal entities, so it strengthens federal control.",
