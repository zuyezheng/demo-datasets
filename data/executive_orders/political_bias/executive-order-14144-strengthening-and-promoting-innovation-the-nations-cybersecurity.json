    "critique": "This executive order focuses on improving the nation's cybersecurity. It directs various agencies to take steps to strengthen software supply chain security, improve the cybersecurity of federal systems, secure federal communications, combat cybercrime and fraud, promote security with AI, and align policy to practice. It also amends Executive Order 13694 to address malicious cyber-enabled activities. The order emphasizes collaboration between government agencies and the private sector. There is a strong emphasis on national security and protecting federal systems and data. There is also a focus on innovation and using emerging technologies to improve cybersecurity. The order does not directly address immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does not seem to strongly favor either liberal or conservative ideologies. It does expand executive power by directing agencies to take specific actions and implement new policies. It also centralizes authority in the federal government by giving CISA more power to hunt for and identify threats across FCEB agencies. The order prioritizes national security over civil liberties by giving the government more access to data and systems. Therefore: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration Approach: 0, Executive Power: 3, Federalism: 3, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 3, Economic Regulation: 0, Social Inclusion: 0",
