    "critique": "This document pertains to the administration of the National Emergency Council during the Great Depression. It defers the abolition of volunteer field agencies. Given the context of the Great Depression and the New Deal, this suggests government intervention in the economy. There is no information about immigration, civil liberties, or social issues. The order expands executive power by extending the life of these agencies. It also centralizes power at the federal level, as the National Emergency Council was a federal entity.",
