    "critique": "This document establishes two customs ports of entry in Puerto Rico. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The federal government is exerting its authority over customs, which could be seen as a slight increase in federal power, but it's a standard function, so it remains close to neutral.",
