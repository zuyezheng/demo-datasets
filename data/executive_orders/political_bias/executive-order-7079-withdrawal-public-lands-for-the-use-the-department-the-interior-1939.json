    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1935 that withdraws land in Alaska for a school for the Office of Indian Affairs. It seems to be a fairly standard administrative action. There's not much to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on executive power beyond the routine. It does shift control of land to the federal government, so it has a slight federalism lean. It also seems to promote social inclusion by providing a school for the Office of Indian Affairs. There's no obvious impact on national security vs. civil liberties or economic regulation.",
