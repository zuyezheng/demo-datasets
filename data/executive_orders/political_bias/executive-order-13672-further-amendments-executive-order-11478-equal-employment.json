    "critique": "This executive order prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in federal government procurement. This aligns with a liberal stance on social inclusion and diversity. It amends previous executive orders to include these protections. The order doesn't explicitly expand executive power, but it does direct the Secretary of Labor to prepare regulations, which could be seen as a slight expansion. It doesn't directly address immigration, federalism, or national security. Economically, it promotes fairness in government procurement, which could be seen as a moderate intervention. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
