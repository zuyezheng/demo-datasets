    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order from 1933, signed by the President. It withdraws public lands in California from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. This seems to be a fairly routine administrative action. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt. It doesn't directly relate to immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in an obvious way. Federalism is implicated insofar as it is a federal action concerning federal lands, but it doesn't dramatically shift the balance. Given that it is a presidential order, there is a slight increase in executive power, but it is not a major shift. The action itself doesn't seem to favor any particular group or ideology.",
