    "critique": "This executive order establishes the order of succession within the Department of Homeland Security. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or social inclusion. It primarily concerns the continuity of leadership within a specific government department. The order itself does not expand executive power significantly, as it mainly clarifies the line of succession. It has a neutral impact on federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, and economic regulation. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
