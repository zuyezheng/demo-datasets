    "critique": "This document pertains to civil service employment and the criteria for demotion or separation due to reduction in force. It modifies the weighting of length of service in determining these actions. There is no immediately obvious ideological tilt, immigration aspect, expansion of executive power, or bearing on national security vs. civil liberties. It has a slight impact on economic regulation through government employment practices and a very slight impact favoring conformity by disincentivizing long service for those eligible for retirement.",
