    "critique": "This executive order withdraws 40 acres of land in California from settlement and reserves it as an addition to the reservation for the Camp or Fort Independence Indians. This action suggests a degree of consideration for the rights and needs of Native Americans. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a readily scorable way. However, the act of setting aside land for Native Americans could be interpreted as a slight move towards social inclusion.",
