    "critique": "This document is a straightforward administrative order regarding a customs port of entry. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The revocation of a customs port could be very slightly construed as deregulation, but it's such a minor action that it's best to keep it neutral.",
