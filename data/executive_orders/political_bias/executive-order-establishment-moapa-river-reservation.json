    "critique": "The document establishes land for Native American use, which suggests a slight lean towards social inclusion and federal control. It doesn't directly address economic regulation, immigration, executive power, national security, or ideological tilt, so those are scored as neutral. The act of setting aside land implies some federal control, but it's not a strong assertion.",
