    "critique": "This document primarily concerns adjustments to the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System to align it with amendments to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document itself doesn't expand executive power, but rather implements changes mandated by pre-existing public laws.",
