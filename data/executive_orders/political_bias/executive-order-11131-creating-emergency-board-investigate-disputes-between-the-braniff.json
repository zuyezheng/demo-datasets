    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate disputes between airlines and their employees, preventing changes to the conditions out of which the disputes arose for a limited time. It seems to be a fairly neutral intervention to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. There's no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It does expand executive power slightly by creating the board, and it leans towards federal control by intervening in what could be seen as a state matter. It also involves government in economic matters by preventing changes to the conditions out of which the disputes arose.",
