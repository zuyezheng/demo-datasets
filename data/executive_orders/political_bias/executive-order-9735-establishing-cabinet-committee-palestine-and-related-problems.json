It doesn't directly address immigration in a broad sense, but focuses on a specific humanitarian crisis. It expands executive power by creating a committee with broad authority to implement policies related to Palestine. It centralizes decision-making at the federal level. It doesn't directly impact national security vs. civil liberties. It doesn't directly regulate the economy. It promotes social inclusion by addressing the needs of displaced Jews. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
