    "critique": "This document is a simple delegation of authority during the Secretary of Commerce's absence. It doesn't touch on any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis it arguably relates to is executive power, but even there, it's a routine delegation, not an expansion or restriction of power. Therefore, all axes should be scored as neutral (0).",
