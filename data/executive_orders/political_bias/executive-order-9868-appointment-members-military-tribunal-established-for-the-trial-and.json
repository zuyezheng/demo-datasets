    "critique": "This document establishes military tribunals for war criminals after WWII. It seems to be focused on international law and justice following a major conflict. There's no clear indication of a left or right ideological tilt. It doesn't directly address immigration. It expands executive power in a time of war/post-war. It involves federal control over military tribunals. It prioritizes national security and international justice. It doesn't directly regulate the economy. It doesn't directly address social inclusion, but the pursuit of justice for war crimes could be seen as promoting a more inclusive world order.",
