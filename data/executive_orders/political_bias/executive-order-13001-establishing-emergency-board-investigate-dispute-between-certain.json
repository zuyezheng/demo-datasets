    "critique": "The document establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between railroads and their employees, preventing any changes to the conditions out of which the dispute arose for a period of time. It does not express a clear ideological tilt, immigration stance, or position on social inclusion. The document seems to expand executive power by establishing the board and maintaining conditions, has a strong federal control as it is a federal intervention in a labor dispute, and balances security and liberty by ensuring essential transportation services while also protecting the rights of workers and companies. It also seems to have moderate regulation.",
