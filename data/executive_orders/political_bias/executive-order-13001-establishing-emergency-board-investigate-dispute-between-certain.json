    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between railroads and their employees. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The primary focus is on economic regulation by preventing changes to the conditions out of which the dispute arose, which can be seen as a moderate intervention to maintain the status quo and prevent disruption of interstate commerce. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a slight lean towards intervention on the economic regulation axis.",
