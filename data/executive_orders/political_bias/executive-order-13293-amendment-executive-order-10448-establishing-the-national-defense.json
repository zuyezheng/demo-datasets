    "critique": "This executive order pertains to extending eligibility for the National Defense Service Medal to members of the Selected Reserve of the Armed Forces. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order itself doesn't expand executive power; it simply modifies an existing order related to military awards.",
