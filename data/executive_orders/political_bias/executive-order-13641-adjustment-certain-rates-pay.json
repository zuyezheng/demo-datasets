    "critique": "This document primarily deals with setting pay schedules for federal employees, including those in the statutory pay systems, senior executive service, executive/legislative/judicial branches, uniformed services, administrative law judges, and locality-based comparability payments. It is implementing a previously passed law (Public Law 113-6) that requires certain pay schedules to remain at 2010 levels through 2013. There is nothing inherently liberal or conservative about this. It doesn't touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It could be argued that maintaining pay levels is a form of economic intervention, but it's also a form of fiscal constraint. It doesn't expand executive power, as it's implementing existing law. It doesn't obviously favor federal or state control. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
