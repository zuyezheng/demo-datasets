    "critique": "The document pertains to a delegation of authority from the President to the Secretary of Defense regarding the appointment, reappointment, promotion, and active duty orders of medical professionals and reservists in the armed forces. It amends Executive Order No. 10478, focusing on subsections of the act of September 9, 1950, and the Universal Military Training and Service Act. There is no direct discussion of social issues, economic policy, or immigration. Therefore, many of the axes are neutral. The delegation to the Secretary of Defense implies a slight expansion of executive power, or at least a continuation of existing executive power structures.",
