    "critique": "This executive order establishes a wildlife refuge. It withdraws land from settlement and reserves it for the Department of Agriculture to protect antelope and other wildlife. There's nothing inherently liberal or conservative about wildlife conservation, so the ideological tilt is neutral. The order doesn't deal with immigration. It could be argued that setting aside land for federal use expands executive power, but it's a fairly limited action. It shifts control to the federal government, so it leans towards federal primacy. It doesn't directly address national security or civil liberties. It involves government intervention in land use, but not in a way that directly regulates the economy. It doesn't have a clear impact on social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
