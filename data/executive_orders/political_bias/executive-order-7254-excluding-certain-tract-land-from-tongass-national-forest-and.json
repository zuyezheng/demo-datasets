    "critique": "This document is a land order regarding a tract of land in Alaska. It removes a specific piece of land from the Tongass National Forest and restores it to entry under public-land laws, effectively allowing it to be used as a homesite. Given the nature of the document, several axes are not applicable or have a neutral score. There's no indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power expansion, national security concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only relevant axis is federalism, where the decision to transfer land from federal to individual control suggests a slight move towards state/individual control, but it's a very minor adjustment.",
