    "critique": "This executive order cancels a previous order that added land to the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation and then adds other lands to the reservation. It also states that existing valid rights to the lands described will not be affected. This seems to be a relatively neutral action, simply adjusting the boundaries of the reservation. There's no strong indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, executive power expansion, or a shift in federalism. It seems to balance the interests of the tribe with existing rights. It is difficult to assess its impact on national security vs. civil liberties or economic regulation. It seems to promote social inclusion by expanding the reservation.",
