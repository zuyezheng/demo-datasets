    "critique": "This document pertains to the restoration of public water reserves in Montana. It revokes a previous executive order from 1917 regarding specific land descriptions and stipulates that the land will not be subject to public land laws until a later date. Given the nature of the document, it has minimal impact on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. The primary impact is on federalism, as it involves federal land management, but the revocation and restoration seem neutral in terms of shifting power between state and federal entities. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
