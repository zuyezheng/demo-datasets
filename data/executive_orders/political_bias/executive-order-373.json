    "critique": "This document is a formal announcement of the death of ex-President Andrew Johnson and instructions for naval honors. It is unlikely to have strong political implications. Most scores should be neutral. There might be a slight conservative tilt due to the honoring of a past president, but it's minimal. There is no clear impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
