    "critique": "This executive order pertains to compensation for enlisted men in the Navy and Coast Guard who demonstrate special qualifications in the use of arms. It establishes a tiered system of additional compensation based on proficiency. There is no direct impact on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, social inclusion. The economic regulation aspect is minimal, dealing only with specific compensation within the military. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
