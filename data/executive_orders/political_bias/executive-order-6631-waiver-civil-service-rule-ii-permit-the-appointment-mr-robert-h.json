    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that waives Civil Service Rule II for two individuals, allowing them to be appointed to positions in the Air Corps due to their heroic actions. It is difficult to assess the document's position on the traditional left-right political spectrum. The document does not address immigration. The document does not expand executive power, as it is a specific waiver for two individuals. The document does not directly address federalism. The document does not directly address national security vs. civil liberties. The document does not directly address economic regulation. The document promotes social inclusion by recognizing and rewarding the heroic actions of these individuals, but it is a very specific case and does not represent a broad policy shift.",
