    "critique": "This document establishes the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works and allocates funds for highway building and naval construction. Ideologically, it leans liberal due to government intervention in the economy through public works projects. Immigration is not addressed. It expands executive power by creating new offices and boards. Federalism is strengthened as the federal government distributes funds to states. National security is somewhat prioritized through naval construction, but civil liberties are not directly impacted. Economic regulation is heavily emphasized through government spending and control over project distribution. Social inclusion is not directly addressed.",
