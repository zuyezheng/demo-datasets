    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the number of members on the Advisory Committee on Public Interest Obligations of Digital Television Broadcasters. It increases the maximum number of members from 22 to 25 and makes a minor grammatical change. This action appears to be administrative in nature and has little to no impact on the axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
