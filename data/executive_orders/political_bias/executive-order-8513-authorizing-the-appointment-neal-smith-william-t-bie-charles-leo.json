    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1940 that allows several individuals to be appointed to classified positions without complying with Civil Service Rules. This appears to be a specific exemption for these individuals. It's difficult to assess broad ideological or political biases based on this single action. The order seems to expand executive power by bypassing standard hiring procedures. It doesn't directly address immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral.",
