    "critique": "This document is a land designation for the Lighthouse Service in Hawaii. It's a very specific, localized action with minimal impact on broader political issues. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. There's no indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power grab, federalism shift, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion implications. The only possible exception might be a slight federalism lean, as it's a federal action within a territory, but it's too minor to warrant a strong score.",
