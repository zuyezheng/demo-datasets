    "critique": "This document designates the Inter-American Defense Board as a public international organization, entitling it to certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities under the International Organizations Immunities Act. This action has minimal impact on the axes. It doesn't directly relate to ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The designation is primarily administrative, facilitating international cooperation. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
