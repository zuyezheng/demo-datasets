    "critique": "This document revokes a previous executive order that reserved land for use as an emergency landing field for airplanes. It's a simple administrative action with minimal political implications. It doesn't touch on ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
