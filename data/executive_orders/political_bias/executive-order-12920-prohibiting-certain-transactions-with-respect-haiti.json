    "critique": "This executive order, issued in 1994, focuses on imposing economic sanctions on Haiti due to the actions of the de facto regime. It restricts financial transactions, exports, and other activities, with exceptions for humanitarian aid and certain essential goods. The order aims to pressure the regime through economic means. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties within the US, or social inclusion. It delegates authority to the Secretary of the Treasury and relies on existing legislation like the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The order does not seem to expand executive power significantly beyond what is already authorized by law. It also does not directly impact federalism. The focus is primarily on foreign policy and economic pressure.",
