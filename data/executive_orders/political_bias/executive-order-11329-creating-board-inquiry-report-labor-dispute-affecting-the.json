    "critique": "The document is a presidential order creating a Board of Inquiry to address a labor dispute in the shipbuilding industry. It invokes the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, citing concerns about the strike's potential impact on interstate commerce, national safety and production of goods. There is no explicit discussion of immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral. The economic regulation leans slightly towards intervention due to the government intervention in a labor dispute.",
