    "critique": "The document is a directive implementing the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships. It primarily concerns the delegation of authority to the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating and the authorization of US corporations to admeasure vessels and issue International Tonnage Certificates. Therefore, the document has very little to do with the axes of political bias.",
