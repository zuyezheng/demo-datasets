    "critique": "This document implements an international convention on tonnage measurement of ships. It delegates authority to the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating and allows them to authorize US corporations to admeasure vessels and issue certificates. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
