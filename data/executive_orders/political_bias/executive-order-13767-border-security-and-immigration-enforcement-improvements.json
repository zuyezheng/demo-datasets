    "critique": "This executive order focuses on border security and immigration enforcement. It directs the construction of a wall on the southern border, increased detention of individuals apprehended for immigration violations, and expedited removal proceedings. It also seeks to empower state and local law enforcement in immigration enforcement and limit the use of parole and asylum provisions. The order invokes existing laws like the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Secure Fence Act. Overall, the document reflects a restrictive approach to immigration and prioritizes national security concerns related to border control.",
