It aims to keep America competitive, support American talent, and encourage innovation. The order focuses on evidence-based instruction and doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
