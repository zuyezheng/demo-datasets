    "critique": "This executive order concerns the observance of holidays by government agencies and employees. It clarifies how holidays are to be observed when they fall on non-workdays or when an employee's workday spans two calendar days. There's nothing inherently ideological about this; it's a matter of administrative procedure. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order does not expand executive power, it simply manages the logistics of holiday observance for federal employees. It does not favor state or federal primacy. It does not address national security or civil liberties. It does not regulate the economy. It does not promote or hinder social inclusion or diversity.",
