    "critique": "This executive order establishes a wildlife refuge. It seems to have a slight liberal tilt due to environmental conservation. There is no impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties. It has a slight interventionist approach to economic regulation by restricting land use. It promotes social inclusion by protecting wildlife.",
