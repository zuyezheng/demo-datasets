    "critique": "This document amends a previous executive order (EO 11649) regarding the use of official seals. It specifically pertains to the use of these seals in publications like encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, journals, etc., when used to describe or document seals, coats of arms, heraldry, or the Presidency/Vice Presidency. There's no indication of a liberal or conservative ideological tilt. It doesn't address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0).",
