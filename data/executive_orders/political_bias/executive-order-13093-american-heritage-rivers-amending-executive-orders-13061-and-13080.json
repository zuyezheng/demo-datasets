    "critique": "The document is a presidential order that increases the number of rivers that the President may designate as American Heritage Rivers. This action does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. However, increasing the power of the president to designate rivers as American Heritage Rivers can be seen as a slight expansion of executive power.",
