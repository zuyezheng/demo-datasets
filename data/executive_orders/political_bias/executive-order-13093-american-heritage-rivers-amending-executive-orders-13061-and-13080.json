    "critique": "This document is a short executive order that amends two previous executive orders (13061 and 13080) to increase the number of rivers that the President may designate as American Heritage Rivers from ten to up to 20. This action has minimal impact on the axes of political bias. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by increasing the number of designations the President can make, but the effect is very small. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion aspects.",
