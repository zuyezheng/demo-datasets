    "critique": "This is a military order regarding the punishment of deserters during wartime. It directs that death sentences for desertion be commuted to imprisonment and allows commanding generals to restore deserters to duty in special cases. There is nothing about ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order does touch on national security versus civil liberties, as it deals with the punishment of those who deserted the military during wartime. The initial score for security/liberty is +3, because the order prioritizes national security by punishing desertion, but also mitigates the punishment from death to imprisonment. The final score is +3.",
