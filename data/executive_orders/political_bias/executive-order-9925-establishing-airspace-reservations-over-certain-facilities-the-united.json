    "critique": "This executive order from 1948 restricts airspace over nuclear facilities for national defense purposes. It's difficult to place on a traditional left-right spectrum. It expands executive power to control airspace. It centralizes control at the federal level. It prioritizes national security over individual liberties. It has no direct impact on economic regulation or social inclusion.",
