It enhances interagency coordination, reinforces existing policies, and imposes consequences on those responsible for such actions. The order invokes the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and other legal authorities, granting the executive branch broad powers to address this threat. There is a strong emphasis on protecting U.S. nationals and deterring hostile actions by foreign entities.",
