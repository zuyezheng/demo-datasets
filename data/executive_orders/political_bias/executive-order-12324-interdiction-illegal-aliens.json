    "critique": "This executive order focuses on preventing illegal migration to the United States by sea. It directs the Secretary of State to enter into cooperative arrangements with foreign governments for this purpose and instructs the Coast Guard to enforce the suspension of entry of undocumented aliens. The order specifies the types of vessels subject to these instructions and outlines the Coast Guard's authority to stop, board, and return vessels. It also includes a provision to ensure fair enforcement of immigration laws and observance of international obligations concerning refugees. The order explicitly states that no refugee will be returned without their consent and that actions are only authorized outside US territorial waters.\n\nIdeological Tilt: The order reflects a conservative approach to immigration control, prioritizing border security and enforcement of immigration laws. Score: -3\nImmigration Approach: The order is strictly restrictive regarding illegal immigration, aiming to prevent migrants from entering the US by sea without necessary documents. Score: -4\nExecutive Power: The order expands executive power by authorizing the Coast Guard to take actions to interdict vessels and return migrants. Score: 3\nFederalism: The order centralizes control over immigration enforcement at the federal level, directing federal agencies to take specific actions. Score: 3\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The order prioritizes national security and border control, potentially at the expense of civil liberties for undocumented migrants. However, it includes a provision to protect refugees. Score: 2\nEconomic Regulation: The order does not directly address economic regulation. Score: 0\nSocial Inclusion: The order does not directly address social inclusion, but its restrictive immigration policies may be seen as less inclusive. Score: -2\n\nRevised Scores:\nIdeological Tilt: -3\nImmigration Approach: -4\nExecutive Power: 3\nFederalism: 3\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: 2\nEconomic Regulation: 0\nSocial Inclusion: -2",
