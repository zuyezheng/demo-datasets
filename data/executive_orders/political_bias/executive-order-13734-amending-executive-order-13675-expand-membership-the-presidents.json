    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on promoting trade and investment between the U.S. and Africa. It aims to broaden private sector engagement and increase the membership of the President's Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa. There is little to no mention of immigration, civil liberties, or social issues. The order seems to promote economic growth through deregulation and private sector involvement.",
