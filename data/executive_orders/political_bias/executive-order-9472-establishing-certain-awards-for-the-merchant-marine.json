    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the establishment of awards and recognition for service in the Merchant Marine during World War II. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only possible exception might be executive power, but the order simply delegates authority to the War Shipping Administrator, which is a fairly standard wartime measure and doesn't represent a significant expansion of executive power.",
