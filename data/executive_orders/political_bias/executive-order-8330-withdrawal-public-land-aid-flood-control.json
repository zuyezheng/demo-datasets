    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1940 that withdraws a small piece of unsurveyed public land in Alaska from settlement, location, sale, or entry for flood-control purposes. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of this document, as it is primarily concerned with land management and infrastructure. It does not directly address issues of immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The action is authorized by existing legislation, so it doesn't dramatically expand executive power. The federal government is taking control of the land, so it leans towards federal primacy. It could be argued that flood control is a form of economic intervention, but it is a very minor one. Given the limited scope and nature of the document, most axes should be close to neutral.",
