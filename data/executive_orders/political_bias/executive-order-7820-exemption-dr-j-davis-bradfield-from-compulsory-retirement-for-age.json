    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1938 exempting a specific individual from mandatory retirement. It's a fairly narrow action. There's no clear ideological tilt. It doesn't deal with immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does expand executive power slightly by allowing the President to make exceptions to existing rules, but it's a limited and specific exception.",
