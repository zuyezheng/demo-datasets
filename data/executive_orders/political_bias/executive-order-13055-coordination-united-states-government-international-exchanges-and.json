    "critique": "This executive order establishes an interagency working group to improve coordination, efficiency, and effectiveness of US government-sponsored international exchanges and training programs. It aims to collect data, promote cooperation, identify duplication, develop a coordinated strategy, and expand public-private partnerships. The order does not explicitly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. However, the emphasis on coordination and efficiency could be seen as a slight move towards federal control and potentially some economic regulation, but these are very mild.",
