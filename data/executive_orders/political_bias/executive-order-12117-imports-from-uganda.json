    "critique": "This executive order from 1979 restricts imports from Uganda due to human rights violations. It delegates authority to the Secretary of Treasury to administer the import restrictions and to the Secretary of State to advise on Uganda's human rights situation. The President retains the power to certify to Congress when the restrictions should be lifted. Here's a breakdown of the scores:\n\n*   **Ideological Tilt:** 0. This isn't inherently liberal or conservative. Human rights concerns can be a bipartisan issue.\n*   **Immigration Approach:** 0. This doesn't directly relate to immigration, but rather to trade restrictions based on human rights.\n*   **Executive Power:** 0. The order delegates authority but also retains presidential control through certification to Congress. It seems balanced.\n*   **Federalism:** 0. This doesn't significantly shift power between state and federal entities.\n*   **National Security vs. Civil Liberties:** 0. While it addresses human rights, it's primarily focused on foreign policy and trade, not domestic security vs. liberties.\n*   **Economic Regulation:** 3. This imposes import restrictions, which is a form of government intervention in the economy.\n*   **Social Inclusion:** 3. The order aims to address human rights violations in another country, promoting social inclusion on a global scale.\n\nRevised Scores:\n\n*   Ideological Tilt: 0\n*   Immigration Approach: 0\n*   Executive Power: 0\n*   Federalism: 0\n*   National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0\n*   Economic Regulation: 3\n*   Social Inclusion: 3",
