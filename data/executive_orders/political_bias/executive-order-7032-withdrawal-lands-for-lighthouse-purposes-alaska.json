    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1935 that withdraws land in Alaska for lighthouse purposes. It's a fairly specific and limited action. Ideologically, it's hard to place on a left-right spectrum. It involves government action (reserving land), but it's for a specific, arguably non-controversial purpose (lighthouse). Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is used to withdraw the land, but the order can be revoked by the President or Congress, suggesting some balance. Federalism is implicated as the federal government is acting within a state, but it's for a specific federal purpose. National security vs. civil liberties is not really relevant here. Economic regulation is tangentially involved as the government is controlling land use, but it's not a major intervention. Social inclusion is not relevant.",
