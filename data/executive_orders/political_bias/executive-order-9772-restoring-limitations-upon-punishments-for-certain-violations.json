    "critique": "This document concerns the termination of suspensions on punishment limitations for violations of Articles of War, specifically in occupied enemy territory. It's a legal and administrative action, so ideological tilt is not really applicable. Immigration is not relevant. Executive power is slightly reduced as it terminates previous expansions of power. Federalism is not relevant. National security vs. civil liberties is a bit of a balance, leaning slightly towards liberties as it limits punishments. Economic regulation is not relevant. Social inclusion is not relevant.",
