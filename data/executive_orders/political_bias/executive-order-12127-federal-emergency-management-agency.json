    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) by activating Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1978. It transfers functions related to emergency management from various departments (Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, and the President) to FEMA. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It primarily focuses on government reorganization and the consolidation of emergency management functions. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The exception might be Federalism, where consolidating power into a federal agency could be seen as a slight shift towards federal control.",
