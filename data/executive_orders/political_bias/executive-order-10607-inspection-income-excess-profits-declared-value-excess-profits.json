    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1955 that allows the House Committee on Government Operations to inspect tax returns for the purpose of studying government efficiency. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It does not deal with immigration. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by allowing access to tax returns, but it is also in line with congressional oversight. It does not directly address federalism. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It does not directly address economic regulation. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
