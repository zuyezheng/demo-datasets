    "critique": "This document is a designation by the President that Afghanistan is a combat zone, retroactive to September 19, 2001, for the purposes of section 112 of the Internal Revenue Code. This allows certain tax benefits for members of the Armed Forces serving in Afghanistan. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power implications, federalism concerns, or social inclusion considerations. The order is related to national security in the context of military operations and has a minor economic regulation aspect through tax benefits.",
