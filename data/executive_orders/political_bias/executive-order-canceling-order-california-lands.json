    "critique": "This executive order cancels a previous order that set aside land for Indian purposes. This could be seen as negative towards social inclusion, as it reduces the amount of land reserved for Native Americans. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It does not seem to affect immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation.",
