    "critique": "This document pertains to the amendment of a naval reservation in the Canal Zone. It is a technical document describing land boundaries. There is no indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, or social inclusion. It is difficult to assess executive power or federalism based on this document alone. It does not seem to touch upon economic regulation or civil liberties.",
