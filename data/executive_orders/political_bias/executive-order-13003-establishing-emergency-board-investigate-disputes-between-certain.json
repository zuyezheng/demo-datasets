    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate disputes between railroads and their employees. It is a fairly neutral action, intervening in a labor dispute to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. It doesn't strongly lean in any particular ideological direction, nor does it significantly expand executive power. It seems to maintain a balance and doesn't heavily favor any particular group or principle.",
