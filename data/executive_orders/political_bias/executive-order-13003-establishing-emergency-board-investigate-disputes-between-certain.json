    "critique": "The document establishes an emergency board to investigate disputes between railroads and their employees, preventing disruptions to interstate commerce. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or social inclusion. The order temporarily maintains existing conditions, avoiding immediate changes to economic regulation or executive power. Federalism isn't a primary concern, though the federal government intervenes to resolve the dispute. Security vs. liberty isn't directly relevant, but the order aims to ensure essential transportation services.",
