    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that expands the Wasatch National Forest in Utah. It is signed by the President and based on the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture. The order specifies the land being added by referencing sections, townships, and ranges. It also includes clauses protecting existing legal appropriations and reservations, and restricts the use of federal funds for purchasing private lands within the expanded forest until provision is made for such purchases from the forest's receipts. This document primarily concerns land management and conservation. There is a slight increase in federal power due to the expansion of a national forest.",
