    "critique": "The document describes the inclusion of lands in Utah into the Wasatch National Forest. It outlines specific land descriptions based on the Salt Lake Meridian and stipulates that the withdrawal of land for the national forest should not interfere with existing legal appropriations or public land reservations. It also restricts the use of federal funds for purchasing privately owned lands within the area until provision is made from the receipts of the Wasatch National Forest.",
