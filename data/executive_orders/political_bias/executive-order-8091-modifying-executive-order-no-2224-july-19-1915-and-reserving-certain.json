It modifies a previous order to allow the Bureau of Public Roads to use certain townsite lots for road building projects. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
