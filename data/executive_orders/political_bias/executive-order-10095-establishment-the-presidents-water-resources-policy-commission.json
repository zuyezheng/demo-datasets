    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to study and make recommendations regarding federal responsibility for water resources. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order primarily concerns federalism, as it directs federal agencies to cooperate with the commission. The order itself doesn't expand executive power, but the establishment of a commission within the Executive Office could be seen as a slight centralizing tendency.",
