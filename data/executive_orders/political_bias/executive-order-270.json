    "critique": "This document is a formal announcement of the death of Elihu B. Washburne, a former Secretary of State. It primarily serves as a notification and tribute to his service. There is no direct policy or legislative content to analyze for political bias across the given axes. The announcement focuses on Washburne's contributions and instructs the Department of State and diplomatic officers to acknowledge his passing. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral (0).",
