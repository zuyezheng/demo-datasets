    "critique": "The document establishes the Korean Service Medal for members of the armed forces who served in the Korean theater between June 27, 1950, and a terminal date to be fixed by the Secretary of Defense. The order specifies eligibility criteria, regulations, and posthumous awards. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The establishment of a military medal could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but it is a routine function of the presidency as Commander in Chief.",
