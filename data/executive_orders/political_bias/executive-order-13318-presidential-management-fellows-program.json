    "critique": "This executive order establishes the Presidential Management Fellows Program, which aims to recruit outstanding individuals for public sector management. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by creating a new program, but it also relies on the Director of OPM to prescribe regulations, which provides some balance. It doesn't seem to have a significant impact on federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
