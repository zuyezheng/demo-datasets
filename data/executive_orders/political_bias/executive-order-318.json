    "critique": "This document is a special order from the Navy Department announcing the death of ex-President Ulysses S. Grant and outlining mourning procedures. It primarily concerns military protocol and respect for a former president. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration approach, executive power dynamics, federalism concerns, national security implications, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
