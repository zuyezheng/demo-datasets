    "critique": "This is a short executive order regarding a specific appointment within the Veterans' Administration. It waives civil service rules for Mr. Hoes. Given the limited scope and nature of the order, assessing its position on the axes is difficult, but here is my attempt.\n\nIdeological Tilt: This is difficult to assess. It's a specific personnel decision, not a broad policy statement. I will score it as neutral.\nImmigration Approach: This order has nothing to do with immigration.\nExecutive Power: Waiving civil service rules could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, allowing the executive branch to bypass standard procedures. However, it is a very specific case.\nFederalism: The order concerns a federal agency, but doesn't significantly alter the balance of power between the federal government and the states.\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The order doesn't directly address national security or civil liberties.\nEconomic Regulation: The order doesn't directly address economic regulation.\nSocial Inclusion: Waiving civil service rules could potentially be seen as undermining a meritocratic system, but without more context, it's hard to say. I will score it as neutral.\n\nRevised Scores:\nI will adjust the executive power score to be more neutral, as the impact is minimal.",
