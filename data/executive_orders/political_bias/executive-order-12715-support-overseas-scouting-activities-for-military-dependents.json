It delegates authority to the Secretary of Defense to issue regulations concerning cooperation and support. There is no explicit discussion of immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial and revised scores are the same, reflecting a neutral stance on these issues.",
