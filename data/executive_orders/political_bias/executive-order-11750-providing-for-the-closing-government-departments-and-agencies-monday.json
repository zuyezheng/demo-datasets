    "critique": "This executive order is a straightforward directive to close government offices on the days preceding Christmas and New Year's Day in 1973, with exceptions for national security and defense. It also clarifies how these days should be treated in terms of employee pay and leave. There's no indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or any impact on civil liberties. It doesn't expand executive power significantly, as it's a temporary measure. It also doesn't touch on federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
