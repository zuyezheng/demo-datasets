    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the delegation of presidential authority under the Stafford Act to the Director of FEMA. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis with a potential score is Federalism and Executive Power. Because it delegates power to the director of FEMA, it could be argued that it centralizes authority at the federal level, but it is also possible to see it as simply an administrative detail. I will score it as a slight shift towards federal control and a slight restraint on executive power, but close to neutral.",
