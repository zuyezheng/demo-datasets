    "critique": "This document extends the life of a committee focused on cost control in the federal government. This suggests a slight conservative tilt as it aims to reduce government spending. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation or social inclusion, so these should be neutral. The extension of a committee could be seen as a very slight increase in executive power, but it is minor.",
