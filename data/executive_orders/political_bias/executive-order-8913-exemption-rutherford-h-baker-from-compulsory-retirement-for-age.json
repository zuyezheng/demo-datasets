    "critique": "This is an executive order regarding the exemption of an employee from compulsory retirement. It does not seem to have any significant implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it touches on is executive power, as it is an executive order that allows the president to make an exception to a rule. However, this is a fairly minor expansion of executive power, so I will score it as 1.",
