    "critique": "The document focuses on foreign policy and national security, specifically addressing the situation in Angola and the actions of UNITA. It invokes presidential powers to declare a national emergency and impose restrictions. There is little to gauge on social inclusion, immigration, or economic regulation within the US. The primary focus is on executive power in foreign affairs and national security.",
