    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between The Long Island Rail Road and certain labor organizations. It is a fairly neutral document that follows the Railway Labor Act. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It seems to have a slight impact on economic regulation and federalism, but not significantly. There is no impact on social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
