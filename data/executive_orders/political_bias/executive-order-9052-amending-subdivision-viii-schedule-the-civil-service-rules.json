    "critique": "This document is a simple amendment to the Civil Service Rules, adding the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior to Subdivision VIII of Schedule A. This seems to be an administrative action. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power shift, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation changes, or social inclusion aspects. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
