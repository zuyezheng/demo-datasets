    "critique": "This document pertains to the composition of a military commission in 1865. It is an administrative order, detailing changes in personnel. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The appointment of a military commission could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, but this is within the context of wartime and military administration, so it's not a significant expansion in the modern sense.",
