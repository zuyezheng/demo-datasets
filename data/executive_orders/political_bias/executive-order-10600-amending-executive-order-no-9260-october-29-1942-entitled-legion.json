    "critique": "This executive order concerns the awarding of the Legion of Merit to members of the US and foreign armed forces. It refines the process and delegation of authority for awarding the medal. There's no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or economic regulation. It touches on executive power by detailing who can award the medal, and federalism isn't directly addressed. National security is relevant as it pertains to military honors, but civil liberties aren't a primary concern. Social inclusion isn't directly addressed either.",
