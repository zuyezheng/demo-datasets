    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1939 that transfers small parcels of land in Alaska from National Forest to public land laws, allowing for private use for trade, manufacturing, and homesites. It's a very specific action, so it's hard to place on a traditional left-right spectrum. It could be argued that making land available for private use leans slightly conservative. There's no immigration component. It doesn't seem to expand executive power significantly, as it's based on existing legislation. It shifts control slightly away from the federal government (National Forest) to public land laws, which could be seen as a slight move towards state control or individual use. There's no clear national security or civil liberties angle. Allowing private use of land could be seen as a slight move towards deregulation. There's no clear social inclusion aspect.",
