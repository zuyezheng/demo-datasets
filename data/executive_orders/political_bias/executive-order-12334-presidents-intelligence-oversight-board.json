    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's Intelligence Oversight Board. It aims to enhance the security of the United States by assuring the legality of activities of the Intelligence Community. The board is composed of members appointed by the President. The board's responsibilities include informing the President of intelligence activities that violate the Constitution or laws, forwarding reports to the Attorney General, reviewing internal guidelines, and conducting investigations. The order emphasizes adherence to the law and Constitution within the Intelligence Community. It also ensures the protection of classified information. It is difficult to place this on the left-right spectrum. It does not deal with immigration or economic regulation. It could be seen as expanding executive power, but it also constrains the intelligence community. It is hard to say whether it favors national security over civil liberties. It does not deal with social inclusion. It does not seem to affect federalism.",
