    "critique": "This document is an executive order from President Reagan in 1985 that declares a national emergency with respect to Nicaragua and prohibits trade and transportation with Nicaragua, with an exception for exports to the 'organized democratic resistance'.\n\n*   **Ideological Tilt:** The order reflects a conservative foreign policy stance, particularly in its opposition to the Nicaraguan government, which the Reagan administration viewed as communist. Score: -3\n*   **Immigration Approach:** The document does not directly address immigration, so it is neutral on this axis. Score: 0\n*   **Executive Power:** The order utilizes broad executive powers to impose economic sanctions and restrict trade. This indicates an expansion of executive power. Score: 3\n*   **Federalism:** The order does not directly impact the balance of power between the federal and state governments. Score: 0\n*   **National Security vs. Civil Liberties:** The order prioritizes national security by restricting trade and transportation with Nicaragua, potentially at the expense of economic freedom. Score: 3\n*   **Economic Regulation:** The order imposes significant economic regulations by prohibiting trade and transportation with Nicaragua. Score: 4\n*   **Social Inclusion:** The document does not directly address social inclusion. Score: 0",
