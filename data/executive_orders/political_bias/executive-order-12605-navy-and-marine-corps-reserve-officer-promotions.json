    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating authority regarding the promotion of commissioned officers in the Naval Reserve and Marine Corps Reserve. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, economic regulation, social inclusion, or civil liberties. It slightly expands executive power by delegating a function previously held by the President. It does not obviously affect federalism. It has no implications for national security. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral (0).",
