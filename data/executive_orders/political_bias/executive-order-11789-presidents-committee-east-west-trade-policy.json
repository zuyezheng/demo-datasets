    "critique": "The document establishes a committee focused on East-West trade policy, which suggests a moderate level of government intervention in the economy. It doesn't directly address social issues, immigration, or security, so those scores are neutral. The emphasis on executive committees and presidential designation implies a slight expansion of executive power. The document does not explicitly address federalism, so it is scored as neutral. The document does not explicitly address social inclusion, so it is scored as neutral.",
