It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards conservation, which could be interpreted as a mild form of social inclusion (protecting biodiversity).",
