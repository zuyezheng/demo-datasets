    "critique": "This executive order primarily concerns the delegation of authority related to the Export Administration Act of 1969. It delegates powers to the Secretary of Commerce and other officials, establishes a review board, and outlines procedures for export license matters. There's a mention of combating international terrorism through cooperation, which could be seen as a national security element. However, the document doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation in a broad sense, or social inclusion. It seems largely procedural and administrative. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The delegation of power to the Secretary of Commerce could be interpreted as a slight expansion of executive power, but it's more about efficient administration than a fundamental shift in power dynamics. The mention of national security concerns related to terrorism justifies a small positive score on the National Security vs. Civil Liberties axis.",
