    "critique": "The document is an executive order issued by President Eisenhower to create a board to investigate a labor dispute between railroad companies and their employees. It invokes the Railway Labor Act and aims to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. The order itself doesn't express strong opinions on most of the axes, but the action of intervening in a labor dispute suggests a moderate level of government intervention in the economy.",
