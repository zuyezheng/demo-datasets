    "critique": "This document is an executive order that delays certain transfers, consolidations, and eliminations provided for under section 4 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, as amended, be further delayed beyond the effective date of that order. It appears to be related to economic regulation and government intervention. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt, immigration implications, or implications for civil liberties. It gives some power to the Secretary of the Treasury, approved by the President.",
