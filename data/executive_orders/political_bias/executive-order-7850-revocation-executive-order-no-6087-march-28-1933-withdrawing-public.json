It seems to be an administrative action related to land management and does not directly address any of the axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The action is related to land management.",
