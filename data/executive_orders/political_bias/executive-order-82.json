    "critique": "This document pertains to a minor adjustment of a wood reservation boundary for Fort Fill in Oklahoma Territory. It involves aligning the eastern boundary with the 98th meridian, which also serves as a boundary line between the Kiowa and Comanche Reservation and the Chickasaw Nation. This adjustment is made pursuant to an act of Congress. Given the limited scope and specific nature of the document, it does not directly address broad ideological issues, immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The primary focus is on land management and boundary alignment, with a nod to federal law. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism aspect leans slightly towards federal control due to the involvement of an act of Congress and the Secretary of War.",
