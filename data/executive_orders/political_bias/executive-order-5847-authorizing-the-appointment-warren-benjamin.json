    "critique": "The document describes the appointment of Warren Benjamin to a clerical position in the Treasury Department without compliance with civil-service rules. The rationale provided is that Mr. Benjamin is the stepson of the late Graham Nichol, who had served the government for 14 years and whose death left his widow without adequate means of support. This appears to be a case of patronage or nepotism.",
