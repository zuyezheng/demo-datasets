    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1936 that allows one government employee to continue working past the retirement age. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of this document, but it seems fairly neutral. There is no mention of immigration, so it is also neutral on that front. The executive order does expand executive power, as it allows the president to exempt someone from a law. It is difficult to assess the impact on federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion, so I will mark them as neutral.",
