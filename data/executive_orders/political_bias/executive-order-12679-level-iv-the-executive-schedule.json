    "critique": "This document is a simple executive order that creates a new position within the Executive Schedule. It doesn't touch on any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It has a very slight impact on executive power by creating a new position, but it's minimal. It also doesn't significantly affect federalism.",
