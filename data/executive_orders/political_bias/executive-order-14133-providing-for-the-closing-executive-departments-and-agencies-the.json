    "critique": "This document is an executive order to close all federal government departments and agencies on January 9, 2025, as a mark of respect for James Earl Carter, Jr. It is difficult to assess a political bias as the order is a symbolic gesture of respect. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 0.",
