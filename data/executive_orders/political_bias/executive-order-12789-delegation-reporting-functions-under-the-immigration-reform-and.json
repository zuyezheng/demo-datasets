    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating presidential functions related to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 to the Attorney General and Secretary of Labor. It does not express a clear ideological tilt, nor does it directly address economic regulation, security vs. liberty, or social inclusion. It's primarily an administrative action. The impact on immigration is indirect, as it simply assigns responsibilities. There's no explicit expansion or restriction of executive power; it's a delegation of existing authority. Similarly, the impact on federalism is neutral. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
