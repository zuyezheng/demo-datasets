    "critique": "The document delegates presidential functions related to immigration reform and control to the Attorney General and Secretary of Labor. It doesn't express a clear ideological tilt but focuses on the implementation of existing laws. It doesn't explicitly expand or restrain executive power but rather assigns responsibilities. The document doesn't directly address federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
