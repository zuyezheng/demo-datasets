    "critique": "This executive order establishes the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped. It aims to facilitate employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities by providing information, promoting cooperation, and conducting public education programs. The order itself doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a significant way, or federalism. It focuses on a specific social issue (disability employment) and establishes a committee to address it. There's a slight expansion of executive power in creating the committee, but it's relatively minor. It promotes social inclusion by focusing on employment for the handicapped. It involves government intervention in the economy by promoting employment.",
