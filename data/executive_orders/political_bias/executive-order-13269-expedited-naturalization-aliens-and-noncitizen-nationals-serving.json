    "critique": "The order is focused on expediting naturalization for active-duty military members during the war on terror. Initial scores reflect a slightly conservative stance due to the focus on national security and military service, but also a slightly open immigration policy for those who serve. Revised scores adjust to reflect the order's primary focus on military service and national security during wartime, with a more balanced approach to immigration.",
