    "critique": "This document is an executive order that allows the House of Representatives' Committee on Public Works to inspect income, estate, or gift tax returns for the years 1956 to 1970. The purpose is to investigate the administration of the Federal-Aid Highway Program. There is nothing to suggest any ideological tilt. The document does not relate to immigration. The order could be seen as slightly expanding executive power by allowing access to tax returns, but it is also enabling oversight by the legislative branch, so it is close to neutral. It is difficult to assess the impact on federalism. The order could be seen as slightly impinging on privacy, but it is for a specific purpose and time period. The order does not directly relate to economic regulation. The order does not directly relate to social inclusion.",
