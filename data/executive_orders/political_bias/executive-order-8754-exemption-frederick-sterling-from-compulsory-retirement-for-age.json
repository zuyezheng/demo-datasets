    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts Frederick A. Sterling from compulsory retirement. It does not seem to have any implications for ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it seems to affect is executive power, as it expands the executive's authority to exempt individuals from compulsory retirement.",
