    "critique": "This executive order adjusts the boundaries of two Indian Reservations in California. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt without more context, but given the era, policies regarding Native American land could be seen as leaning towards conformity and less towards social inclusion. Immigration is not addressed. The order itself doesn't inherently expand executive power, but the act of modifying reservation boundaries through executive order suggests a degree of federal control. National security vs. civil liberties isn't directly relevant here. Economic regulation isn't a primary focus, but land allocation has economic implications. Federalism is implicated as the federal government is making decisions about land that could arguably be under state control. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
