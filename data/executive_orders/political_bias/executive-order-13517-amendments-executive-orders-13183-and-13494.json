    "critique": "This executive order amends previous orders related to Puerto Rico and labor-management relations. It aims to improve the treatment of Puerto Rico in federal programs and promote economic development, while also clarifying allowable costs for contractors regarding labor relations. There's a slight tilt towards social inclusion by focusing on Puerto Rico, and a moderate interventionist approach by promoting federal initiatives for the island's development. The labor section leans slightly towards supporting labor-management relations. It doesn't significantly expand executive power or impact national security/civil liberties. It also doesn't directly address immigration or federalism in a substantial way.",
