    "critique": "This document pertains to the National Industrial Recovery Act, which was a New Deal program. This program was designed to combat the Great Depression through government intervention in the economy. Therefore, it is liberal in the sense that it favors government intervention. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. However, it does regulate the economy. Therefore, the ideological tilt is liberal, the immigration approach is neutral, the executive power is neutral, the federalism is neutral, the national security vs. civil liberties is neutral, the economic regulation is interventionist, and the social inclusion is neutral.",
