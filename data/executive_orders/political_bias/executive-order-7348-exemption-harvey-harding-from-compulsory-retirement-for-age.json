    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1936 exempting Harvey A. Harding from mandatory retirement. It is a specific, targeted action with minimal broader implications. It doesn't touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on executive power, as it uses existing authority to make an exception, but it's not a major expansion. It has no bearing on federalism or economic regulation. The ideological tilt is negligible.",
