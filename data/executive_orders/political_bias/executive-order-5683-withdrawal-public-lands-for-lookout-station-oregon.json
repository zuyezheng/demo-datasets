    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order from 1931, reserving 40 acres of land in Oregon for use as a lookout station by the State Forest Service. It references specific acts of Congress and stipulates that the timber on the land remains subject to sale by the United States. There is nothing about ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, all scores should be neutral.",
