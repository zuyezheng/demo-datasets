    "critique": "This document establishes the role of the Chairman of the United States Civil Service Commission in assisting the President with personnel management. It revokes a previous executive order and abolishes the Liaison Office for Personnel Management. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It seems mostly neutral. Immigration is not mentioned, so it is neutral. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by centralizing personnel management, but it is not a significant expansion. It centralizes power at the federal level, so it leans towards federal primacy. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It does not directly address economic regulation. It promotes uniformity in federal personnel management, which could be seen as a slight move towards conformity.",
