    "critique": "This document is a standard executive order specifying the line of succession for the Secretary of the Navy. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It is purely an administrative procedure. The executive power axis is also neutral, as it neither expands nor restricts executive authority in any meaningful way; it simply ensures continuity of leadership within the Department of the Navy.",
