    "critique": "This executive order establishes the line of succession for various Secretary positions within the Department of Defense and its branches. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by clarifying succession procedures, but this is a minor effect. It has no direct impact on federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with a slight nudge towards expanding executive power.",
