    "critique": "This document is a simple announcement regarding the closure of government offices for a day of mourning after President Lincoln's assassination. It doesn't contain any policy prescriptions or ideological statements. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. The exception might be social inclusion, where closing offices for a day of mourning could be seen as a gesture towards national unity and shared values, but it's a very weak signal.",
