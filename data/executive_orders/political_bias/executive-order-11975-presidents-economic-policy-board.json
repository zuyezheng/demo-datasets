    "critique": "This document is an executive order that abolishes the President's Economic Policy Board and designates the Secretary of the Treasury as Chairman of the Council on International Economic Policy. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt based on this action alone. It could be argued that abolishing the Economic Policy Board leans slightly towards deregulation, but it's not a definitive move. There is no mention of immigration, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. The change in executive power is negligible. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral.",
