    "critique": "The document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between a railroad company and its employees in order to prevent interruption of interstate commerce. This indicates a moderate level of government intervention in the economy and a balanced approach to labor relations. There is no clear indication of bias regarding immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or social inclusion. The document appears neutral in ideological tilt.",
