    "critique": "This document outlines procedures for the Executive Branch to inform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of its views on nuclear export licenses. It prioritizes national security and gives the Secretary of State a central role in coordinating input from various agencies. There's a slight tilt towards expanding executive power in foreign policy, but it's mostly a procedural matter. There's no direct impact on immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The federalism aspect is neutral as it deals with federal agencies. The ideological tilt is also neutral, as nuclear regulation isn't inherently liberal or conservative.",
