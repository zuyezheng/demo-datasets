    "critique": "This document establishes regulations for the sale, manufacture, and importation of alcoholic beverages in the Canal Zone. It doesn't directly address broad ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. The focus is on controlling alcohol within a specific territory under US jurisdiction. Therefore, most axes should be scored neutrally. The economic regulation aspect is slightly interventionist, as it imposes licensing and restrictions on the sale and manufacture of alcohol.",
