    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the composition and administrative support of presidential advisory councils. It adjusts the membership of the President's Export Council and assigns administrative responsibilities for the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to the Department of Energy. Given the focus on advisory bodies and administrative functions, the document has minimal impact on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
