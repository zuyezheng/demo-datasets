    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order, which removes public land from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. It's a fairly technical and administrative action. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, or civil liberties. It has a slight impact on federalism as it's a federal action affecting land, and a very minor impact on economic regulation as it temporarily restricts land use. There's no clear impact on social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral, with slight adjustments for federalism and economic regulation.",
