    "critique": "The document emphasizes government's role in fostering technological innovation within the manufacturing sector, particularly through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. This suggests a moderate level of government intervention in the economy. The order doesn't explicitly address social issues, immigration, or civil liberties, so those scores are neutral. It also doesn't significantly shift power between the federal and state governments.",
