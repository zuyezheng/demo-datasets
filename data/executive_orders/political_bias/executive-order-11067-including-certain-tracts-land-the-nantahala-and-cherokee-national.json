    "critique": "This document pertains to the transfer of land between the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Department of Agriculture for inclusion in national forests. It's primarily an administrative action with minimal ideological content. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. There's a slight lean towards federalism due to the federal government managing national forests, but it's not a significant shift.",
