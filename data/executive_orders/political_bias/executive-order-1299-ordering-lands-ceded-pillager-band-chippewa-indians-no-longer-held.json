    "critique": "This document declares that land ceded to the US will no longer be considered 'Indian land'. This likely opens the land up to non-indigenous settlement and resource extraction. This suggests a conservative ideological tilt, a restrictive approach to indigenous populations, an expansion of federal power over land use, and an emphasis on conformity rather than diversity. There is no clear impact on executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation.",
