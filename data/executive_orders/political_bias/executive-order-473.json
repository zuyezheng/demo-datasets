    "critique": "This special order from 1862 directs the organization and arming of civil employees in Washington for the defense of the capital. Given the context of the Civil War, this leans towards prioritizing national security. There's no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion beyond wartime necessity, federalism implications, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral, with a slight positive score for national security.",
