    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1935 exempting a carpenter from mandatory retirement. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of such a document. It does not seem to have any implications for immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, all of these are scored as neutral.",
