    "critique": "This executive order addresses a very specific situation: allowing employees of the Division of Grazing in the Department of the Interior to serve as unpaid deputy fire and game wardens at the state level. It appears to be a minor adjustment to existing regulations. Ideologically, it's difficult to place on a left-right spectrum. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It touches on federalism by allowing federal employees to take on state roles, suggesting a cooperative approach. Given the limited scope and specific nature of the order, most axes should be close to neutral.",
