    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts Howell Cone, Collector of Customs for Customs Collection District No. 17, from compulsory retirement for age. It cites the public interest and the authority vested in the president by section 204 of the act of June 30, 1932. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that seems relevant is executive power, as the document uses presidential authority to make an exception to a retirement act. However, this seems like a fairly routine administrative action and not a significant expansion of executive power.",
