    "critique": "This executive order designates the Pan American Health Organization as a public international organization, granting it certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities under the International Organizations Immunities Act. This action has minimal impact on most of the axes. It doesn't significantly alter immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is slightly positive as international cooperation is generally seen as a liberal value, but the effect is minimal.",
