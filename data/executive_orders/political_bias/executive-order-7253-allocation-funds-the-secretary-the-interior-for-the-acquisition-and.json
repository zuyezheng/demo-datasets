    "critique": "This document primarily focuses on preserving historical sites and landmarks, specifically related to the Louisiana Purchase and westward expansion. It allocates funds for this purpose, involving both federal and city contributions. There's a slight tilt towards federalism as it involves federal allocation of funds, but it's balanced by the city's contribution. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, most of these axes should be scored as neutral.",
