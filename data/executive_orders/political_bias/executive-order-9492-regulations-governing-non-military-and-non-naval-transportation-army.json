    "critique": "This executive order, issued during World War II, directs the Secretaries of War and Navy to permit transportation of non-military passengers and cargo on military air transports operating over foreign routes, under specific conditions. The primary goal is to support the war effort, relief, and rehabilitation activities. It prioritizes military needs and ensures that commercial rates are charged for non-military transport, while also stipulating that such transport should not compete with civil air carriers and should be terminated when commercial services are adequate. It is temporary and directly related to the war effort. It does not touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It expands executive power during wartime, but it is temporary and specific. It centralizes control during wartime, but it is temporary and specific. It involves economic regulation by setting rates and priorities, but it is temporary and specific.",
