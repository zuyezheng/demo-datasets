    "critique": "The document centralizes power within the federal government by tasking the Civil Service Commission with standardizing and overseeing the allocation of field positions across various departments. This reduces the autonomy of individual departments and agencies in managing their personnel. The order aims to ensure consistency and facilitate effective recruiting, which suggests a focus on efficiency and standardization rather than diversity or local needs. There is no discussion of immigration, liberties, or social issues.",
