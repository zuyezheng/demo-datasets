    "critique": "This document primarily concerns a technical correction to the boundary of a Native American reservation. It references historical surveys and executive orders to rectify an error in the location of the southern boundary line. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion, or impacts on national security vs. civil liberties. The document seems neutral regarding economic regulation and social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
