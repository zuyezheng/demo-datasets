    "critique": "This executive order focuses on supporting Tribal sovereignty and self-determination by streamlining federal funding and reducing bureaucratic burdens for Tribal Nations. It emphasizes respecting Tribal priorities and partnerships, and ensuring Tribal Nations have the flexibility to address their communities' needs. It does not directly address immigration, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation in a broad sense. It leans towards federalism by directing federal agencies to better support Tribal Nations, but also respects Tribal self-governance, which could be seen as a form of decentralization. It promotes social inclusion by prioritizing the needs and rights of Tribal Nations.",
