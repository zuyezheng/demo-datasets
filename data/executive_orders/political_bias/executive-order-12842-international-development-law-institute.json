    "critique": "The document designates the International Development Law Institute as a public international organization, granting it certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. This action has minimal impact on most of the axes. It doesn't significantly alter immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is slightly positive as international cooperation and development are generally aligned with liberal values.",
