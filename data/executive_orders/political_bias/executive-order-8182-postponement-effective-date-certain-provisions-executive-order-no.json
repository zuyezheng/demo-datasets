    "critique": "This document is an executive order that delays certain transfers, consolidations, and eliminations provided for under section 4 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, as amended. It pertains to the function of disbursement now exercised by United States Marshals under the Department of Justice, and with respect to the function of disbursement for the Postal Service now exercised by officers and employees of that service. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of this document as it is primarily administrative. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on economic regulation as it delays certain transfers, consolidations, and eliminations.",
