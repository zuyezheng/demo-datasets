    "critique": "This document focuses on authorizing the Attorney General to seize and detain arms or munitions being illegally exported from the United States. It touches on national security and law enforcement powers. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, or economic regulation. The federalism aspect is neutral as it's a federal law being enforced. It does expand executive power slightly by designating the Attorney General with this authority.",
