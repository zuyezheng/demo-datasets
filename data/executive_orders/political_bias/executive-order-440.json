    "critique": "This document is a simple order from President Andrew Johnson to General Ulysses S. Grant, appointing him as Secretary of War ad interim after Edwin M. Stanton's suspension. It's a straightforward administrative action with minimal ideological content. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The executive power axis might lean slightly towards expansion, as it involves the president's power to appoint officials, but it's not a significant expansion in this context.",
