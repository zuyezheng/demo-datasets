    "critique": "This executive order is a directive to close executive branch departments and agencies for half a day on Christmas Eve. It seems largely administrative. It does not seem to obviously lean liberal or conservative. There's no direct impact on immigration. It grants department heads some discretion, but it doesn't dramatically expand executive power. It doesn't obviously shift power between the federal and state governments. It includes a carveout for national security, but it doesn't seem to prioritize it heavily. It has a minor economic impact by excusing employees from work for half a day, but it's not a major intervention. It doesn't directly address social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
