    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to create a Holocaust memorial. It doesn't directly address most of the axes. Ideologically, it leans slightly liberal due to its focus on social inclusion and remembrance of a historical tragedy rooted in intolerance. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is neutral, as it simply establishes a commission. Federalism is also neutral. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly relevant. Economic regulation is not addressed. Social inclusion is slightly positive, as the memorial serves as a reminder of the dangers of exclusion.",
