    "critique": "This executive order, issued by President Reagan, mandates drug testing for federal employees and establishes a drug-free workplace policy. It emphasizes national security, public safety, and the efficiency of the federal service. The order reflects a conservative approach to governance, prioritizing law and order and individual responsibility. It expands executive power by directing agencies to implement drug testing programs and personnel actions. The order also touches upon federalism by directing executive agencies, and social inclusion by setting standards of behavior for federal employees.",
