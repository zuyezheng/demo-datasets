    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the order of succession within the Department of Homeland Security. It amends a previous executive order and revokes another. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration policies, or economic regulations. It primarily concerns the internal organization and leadership continuity within a specific government department. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The executive power axis is slightly expanded as it clarifies the line of succession.",
