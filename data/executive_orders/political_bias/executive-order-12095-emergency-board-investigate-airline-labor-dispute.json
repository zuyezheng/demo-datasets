    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between an airline and its employees. It is a fairly neutral action, intervening in a labor dispute. There's a slight tilt towards intervention, but it's minimal. The document doesn't touch on immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. It has a moderate impact on economic regulation by intervening in a labor dispute.",
