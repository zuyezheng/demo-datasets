    "critique": "This document concerns the opening of public lands in New Mexico to homesteading and desert land laws, specifically prioritizing ex-service men of the War with Germany for a period of 91 days. After that, the land becomes available to the general public. There's nothing inherently liberal or conservative about this; it's a land management issue. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is not significantly expanded or restricted. Federalism is implicated as it deals with federal lands, but the order itself doesn't drastically shift the balance. National security vs. civil liberties is not relevant. Economic regulation is minimally involved, as it opens land for private use but doesn't impose significant regulations. Social inclusion is somewhat relevant, as it prioritizes a specific group (ex-service men), which could be seen as favoring a particular demographic, but it eventually opens to the general public.",
