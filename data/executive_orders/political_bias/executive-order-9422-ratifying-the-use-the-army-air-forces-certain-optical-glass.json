    "critique": "This document is a ratification of the use of optical glass by the Army Air Forces during World War II. It is a very specific and limited action, with minimal implications for the axes of political bias. There is no clear ideological tilt, immigration aspect, impact on executive power, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
