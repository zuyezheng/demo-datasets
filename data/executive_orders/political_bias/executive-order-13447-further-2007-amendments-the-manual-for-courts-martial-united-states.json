    "critique": "This document is an executive order amending the Manual for Courts-Martial. It's primarily concerned with military justice and procedural updates. There's no immediately obvious ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on federalism. The main areas to consider are executive power, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation (in a very limited sense), and social inclusion (again, in a limited sense within the military context). Given the nature of the document, most scores should be close to neutral.",
