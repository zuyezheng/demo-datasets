    "critique": "This document is an executive order that waives civil service rules to allow Mrs. Ida A. Coffey to be appointed to a position in the Department of Commerce. It is motivated by the difficult circumstances of her family, including her husband's ill health and her dependent children and mother. There is no clear ideological tilt. The document does not address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in any meaningful way. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
