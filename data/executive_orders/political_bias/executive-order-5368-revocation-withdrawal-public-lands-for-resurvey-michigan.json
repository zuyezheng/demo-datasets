    "critique": "This document is a revocation of a previous executive order regarding land withdrawal in Michigan, specifically within Huron National Forest. It seems to be an administrative action related to land management and doesn't directly address any of the axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The action of revoking the order could be seen as slightly deregulatory, but it's a stretch.",
