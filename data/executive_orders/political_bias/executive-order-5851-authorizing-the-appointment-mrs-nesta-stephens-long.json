    "critique": "This document is an executive order that allows Mrs. Nesta Stephens Long to be appointed as a clerk in the Customs Service in the district of Arizona for a period of one year without regard to her standing on the civil-service junior stenographic register. This is because her husband, Carroll Robert Long, who has served as a clerk in the office of the Collector of Customs at Nogales, Ariz., since July 11, 1927, is forced to give up his position temporarily on account of serious illness. Mrs. Long passed the civil-service examination for junior stenographer, but her name is not within reach for appointment.\n\nIdeological Tilt: The document does not seem to have any ideological tilt.
