    "critique": "This document outlines the procedures for preparing, approving, and publishing Executive Orders and Proclamations. It focuses on standardization, legal review, and proper record-keeping. There's no direct impact on ideological tilt, immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It primarily deals with the internal processes of the executive branch and adherence to existing laws like the Federal Register Act. The order itself doesn't expand executive power; it simply formalizes the process. Similarly, it doesn't shift the balance of power between the federal government and the states. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
