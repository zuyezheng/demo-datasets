    "critique": "This document expresses gratitude to God for a Union victory in the Civil War. This suggests a conservative ideological tilt, as it invokes religious sentiment and aligns with the Union cause. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, security/liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, those axes should be scored as neutral.",
