    "critique": "The document reflects a strong interventionist approach to economic regulation, typical of the New Deal era. It centralizes power in the federal government through the National Industrial Recovery Act and involves the executive branch in setting industry standards. There is no discussion of immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The focus is on government-led economic recovery.",
