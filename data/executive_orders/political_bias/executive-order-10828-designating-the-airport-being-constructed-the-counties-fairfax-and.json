    "critique": "This document is a presidential designation of an airport name. It is difficult to assess political bias as it is largely a symbolic act. The document praises John Foster Dulles and his dedication to democracy, freedom, and peace. There is no clear indication of a stance on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
