    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to study drug abuse and make recommendations. It's difficult to place it on the traditional left-right spectrum (ideological tilt) as drug policy can be approached from various perspectives. The order doesn't directly address immigration. It expands executive power by creating a commission and directing executive departments. It centralizes authority at the federal level. It leans towards national security by addressing drug abuse. It involves government intervention to address drug abuse. It doesn't directly address social inclusion.",
