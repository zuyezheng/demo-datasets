    "critique": "This executive order primarily deals with trade agreements and the organization of governmental bodies responsible for trade negotiations and policy. It establishes the Trade Policy Committee and the East-West Foreign Trade Board, and delegates various responsibilities to the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations. There is little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, as the order focuses on procedural and administrative matters related to trade. It doesn't directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The order delegates authority and defines responsibilities, but it doesn't dramatically expand executive power beyond what is already granted by existing trade acts. It seems to maintain a balance between different governmental bodies and doesn't strongly favor federal or state control. There's no indication of deregulation or heavy government intervention in the economy beyond the existing framework of trade agreements. The order is neutral on social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
