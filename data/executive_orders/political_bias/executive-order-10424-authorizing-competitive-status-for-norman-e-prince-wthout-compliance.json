It doesn't reflect a broader ideological agenda.  2. Immigration Approach: 0. The document has no implications for immigration policy.  3. Executive Power: 0. While it is an executive order, it doesn't significantly expand or restrict executive power. It's a specific intervention to correct an error.  4. Federalism: 0.
