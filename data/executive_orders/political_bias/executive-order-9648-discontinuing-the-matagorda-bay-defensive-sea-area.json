    "critique": "This document simply discontinues a defensive sea area established during World War II. It doesn't inherently lean liberal or conservative, nor does it directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards reducing government intervention, but it's such a minor action that a neutral score is still most appropriate.",
