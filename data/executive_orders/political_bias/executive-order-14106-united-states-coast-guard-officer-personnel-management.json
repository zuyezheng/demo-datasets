    "critique": "This executive order delegates authority regarding the appointment, promotion, separation, and retirement of commissioned officers of the United States Coast Guard from the President to the Secretary of Homeland Security (or Secretary of Defense when the Coast Guard operates as a service in the Navy). It does not touch on ideological issues, immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does shift some power away from the President, but only in a limited scope. It also allows for the suspension of certain laws during war or national emergency, which could potentially impact civil liberties.",
