    "critique": "This executive order focuses on promoting physical fitness and sports through a national program coordinated by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. It encourages cooperation between various sectors (citizens, groups, government, etc.) to improve public health through exercise. There's a slight ideological tilt towards a liberal approach due to the government intervention in public health and promotion of social welfare, but it's not extreme. Immigration is not addressed, so it's neutral. The order delegates presidential functions under the Federal Advisory Committee Act to the Secretary, which could be seen as a slight restraint on executive power. It encourages state and local governments to emphasize physical fitness, suggesting a cooperative balance rather than strong federal control. It doesn't directly address national security or civil liberties. It involves government in promoting physical fitness, which can be seen as a form of intervention. It promotes health for all Americans, which leans towards social inclusion. Given these considerations, the initial scores are as follows.",
