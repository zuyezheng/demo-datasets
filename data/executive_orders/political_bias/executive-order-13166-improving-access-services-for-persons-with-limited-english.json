It directs federal agencies to develop and implement systems to ensure LEP persons can meaningfully access services, consistent with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

It also mandates consultation with stakeholders and emphasizes that the order is intended for internal management and does not create enforceable rights.",
