It outlines the conditions of their service and return. There's no direct indication of ideological leaning (liberal vs. conservative), immigration policy, or social inclusion. It does expand executive power to some extent by authorizing these transfers during a national emergency. It also centralizes control at the federal level, as it involves federal departments.
