    "critique": "This document is a minor amendment to an existing executive order, specifically Executive Order No. 11452, which established the Council for Urban Affairs. The amendment involves a slight modification to the wording regarding the inclusion of additional members in the council. It broadens the scope of who the President can direct to be included in the council, from just heads of departments and agencies to 'heads of departments and agencies and others'. This change appears to grant the President slightly more flexibility in appointing members to the council. Given the limited scope and technical nature of the amendment, the political bias is likely to be minimal. The change does give the executive branch slightly more power.",
