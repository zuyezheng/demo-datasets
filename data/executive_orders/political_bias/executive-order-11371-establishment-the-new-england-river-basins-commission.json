    "critique": "This document establishes the New England River Basins Commission. It seems to be a fairly standard executive order, acting on requests from state governors and in accordance with existing legislation. There's a slight tilt towards federalism as it establishes a federal commission, but it's in response to state requests. There's no obvious ideological slant, immigration component, or impact on civil liberties. Economic regulation is slightly impacted as it relates to water resources. Social inclusion is neutral.",
