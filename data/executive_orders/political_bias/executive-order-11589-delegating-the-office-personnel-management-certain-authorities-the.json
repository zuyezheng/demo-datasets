    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating presidential authority to the United States Civil Service Commission. It pertains to the administration of regulations for assignments to and from states and the establishment and maintenance of personnel standards on the merit basis. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, or social inclusion. It does not obviously expand executive power, but rather delegates it. It does not directly address national security vs. civil liberties. It has a slight impact on federalism, as it deals with assignments to and from states, but it's not a strong shift. It also has a slight impact on economic regulation, as it deals with personnel standards on the merit basis, but it's not a strong shift.",
