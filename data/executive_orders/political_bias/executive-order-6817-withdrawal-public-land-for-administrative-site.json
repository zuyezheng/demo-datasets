    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1934 that withdraws public land in Idaho for use by the Department of Agriculture as an administrative site for storing explosives related to the Challis National Forest. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federal government is exercising its power over federal land, which could be seen as a slight increase in federal power, but it's a very specific and limited action.",
