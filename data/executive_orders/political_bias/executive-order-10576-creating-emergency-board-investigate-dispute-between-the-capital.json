    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between airlines and their employees, preventing changes to the conditions of the dispute for a limited time. It seems to be a fairly neutral intervention to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. It doesn't strongly lean in any particular ideological direction, nor does it touch on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It involves the government in labor relations, but in a limited and temporary way. It could be seen as expanding executive power slightly by creating the board, but it's within the bounds of existing law.",
