    "critique": "This document approves a code of fair competition for stock exchange firms under the National Industrial Recovery Act. This act is a clear example of government intervention in the economy. The document itself doesn't directly address the other axes, but the context of the act suggests a liberal approach to economic regulation. There is no direct impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of these are scored as neutral.",
