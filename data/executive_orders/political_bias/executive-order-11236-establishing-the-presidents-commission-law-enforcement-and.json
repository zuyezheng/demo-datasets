    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to study law enforcement and administration of justice. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt based solely on this. It seems fairly neutral in terms of immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, and social inclusion. The commission is tasked with studying the issues and making recommendations, not implementing specific policies. Therefore, most axes should be close to zero.",
