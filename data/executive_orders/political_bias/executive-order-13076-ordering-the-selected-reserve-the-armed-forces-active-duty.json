    "critique": "This document authorizes the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation to order to active duty any units, and any individual members not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, of the Selected Reserve. This seems to expand executive power, as it allows the President to mobilize the armed forces. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, these axes should be scored as neutral.",
