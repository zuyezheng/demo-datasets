    "critique": "This executive order aims to protect service members, veterans, and their families from deceptive practices by educational institutions and to ensure they receive the educational benefits they are entitled to. It directs federal agencies to establish 'Principles of Excellence' for educational institutions receiving funding from federal military and veterans educational benefits programs. It focuses on providing meaningful information to prospective students, preventing abusive recruiting practices, and ensuring high-quality academic support. The order also seeks to strengthen enforcement and compliance mechanisms, including creating a centralized complaint system and uniform procedures for handling complaints. It does not touch on immigration, and while it involves multiple federal agencies, it doesn't dramatically shift power between the federal government and the states. It also doesn't seem to obviously expand executive power. It seems to promote social inclusion by protecting vulnerable groups (veterans) from predatory practices. It also seems to promote economic regulation by ensuring institutions are not taking advantage of veterans.",
