    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the administration and organization of the Peace Corps and related volunteer programs. It delegates authority, establishes advisory councils, and outlines operational procedures. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. The focus is on government efficiency and program management. Therefore, most axes should be scored neutrally. There is a slight expansion of executive power through delegation, but it's within the existing framework of the Peace Corps Act.",
