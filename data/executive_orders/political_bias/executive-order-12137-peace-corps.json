    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the Peace Corps. It primarily deals with the delegation of authority and administrative functions. There is no direct discussion of immigration, economic regulation, or social issues. Therefore, most axes will be neutral. The order does delegate significant authority, but also reserves some for the President, resulting in a somewhat balanced score for executive power.",
