    "critique": "This document approves a Code of Fair Competition for the Cotton Cloth Glove Manufacturing Industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. This act is a clear example of government intervention in the economy. There is no information related to immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. The document seems to expand federal power over the economy.",
