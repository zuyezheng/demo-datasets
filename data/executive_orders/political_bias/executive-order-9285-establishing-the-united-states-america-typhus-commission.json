    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to study and control typhus fever, primarily to protect members of the armed forces. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It expands executive power slightly by creating a commission within the War Department and authorizing the director to take various actions. It centralizes control at the federal level. It has a slight interventionist approach by allocating resources and personnel to combat a disease. It doesn't directly address social inclusion.",
