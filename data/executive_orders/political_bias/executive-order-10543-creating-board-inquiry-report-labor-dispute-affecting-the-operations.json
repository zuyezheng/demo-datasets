    "critique": "The document establishes a Board of Inquiry to address a labor dispute that threatens national health and safety. It invokes the Labor-Management Relations Act, indicating a moderate regulatory approach to labor relations. The document itself doesn't directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or social inclusion, so those aspects are scored as neutral. The economic regulation aspect is scored as slightly interventionist due to the government intervention in a labor dispute.",
