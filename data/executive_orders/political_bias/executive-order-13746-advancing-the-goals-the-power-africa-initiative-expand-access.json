    "critique": "This executive order focuses on expanding electricity access in Sub-Saharan Africa through the Power Africa initiative. It emphasizes partnership with African governments and the private sector, aiming to increase electricity generation and connections while promoting cleaner energy sources. The order establishes a working group to coordinate efforts across various government agencies. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion within the US. Therefore, the scores for these axes should be neutral. The order promotes economic development in Africa, which could be seen as a form of economic intervention, but it also encourages private sector involvement. The focus on renewable energy suggests a slight tilt towards liberal policies. The order does not significantly expand executive power, as it primarily coordinates existing agencies and initiatives. It also doesn't directly impact federalism within the US.",
