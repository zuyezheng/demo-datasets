    "critique": "This document designates the ITER International Fusion Energy Organization as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities provided by the International Organizations Immunities Act. This seems like a fairly technical and non-ideological action. It doesn't seem to obviously favor either conservatives or liberals, nor does it obviously restrict or expand immigration. It doesn't dramatically expand executive power, as it is based on existing legislation. It doesn't obviously impact federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
