    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1940 that exempts a Navy Yard employee from mandatory retirement for one year. It does not touch upon any of the axes related to ideology, immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The only axis that it arguably touches on is executive power, but the action is very limited and specific, so it doesn't represent a significant expansion or restriction of executive power.",
