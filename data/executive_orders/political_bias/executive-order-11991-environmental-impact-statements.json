    "critique": "This executive order focuses on environmental quality and aims to streamline the environmental impact statement process. It emphasizes making the process more useful, reducing paperwork, and focusing on real environmental issues. This suggests a moderate interventionist approach to environmental regulation. The order reinforces federal authority by directing federal agencies to comply with regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality. There is no direct impact on immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The order does not explicitly expand executive power but clarifies the responsibilities of federal agencies in relation to environmental regulations.",
