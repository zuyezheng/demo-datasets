    "critique": "This document is an executive order that exempts a judge from compulsory retirement. It does not seem to have any strong ideological tilt, nor does it address immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it expands executive power slightly by allowing the president to make an exception to a retirement law, but this is a fairly minor expansion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
