    "critique": "This document establishes a board to investigate a labor dispute between railroad companies and their employees. It aims to prevent interruption of interstate commerce, which is a fairly neutral goal. The order doesn't inherently favor any political ideology, immigration stance, or social group. It seems to expand executive power slightly by creating a board, but it's within the bounds of existing legislation (Railway Labor Act). It also has a slight interventionist approach by trying to resolve a labor dispute.",
