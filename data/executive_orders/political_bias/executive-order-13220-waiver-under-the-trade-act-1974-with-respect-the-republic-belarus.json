    "critique": "This document is a waiver of certain subsections of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to Belarus. It's difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt without more context, but given that it is related to trade, a score of 0 seems appropriate. Immigration is not addressed, so it should be 0. The waiver itself does not expand executive power significantly, so it should be 0. Federalism is not relevant here, so it should be 0. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly implicated, so it should be 0. Economic regulation is indirectly affected, but it's hard to say whether this is deregulation or intervention, so it should be 0. Social inclusion is not relevant, so it should be 0.",
