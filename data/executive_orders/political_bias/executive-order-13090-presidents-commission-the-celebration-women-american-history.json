    "critique": "The document establishes a commission to celebrate women in American history. This suggests a focus on social inclusion and diversity. The document itself doesn't explicitly address economic regulation, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or immigration. Therefore, these aspects are scored as neutral. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the focus on women's history.",
