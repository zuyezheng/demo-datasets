    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous one to include the American Red Cross on the Board for Civilian Protection. This seems like a fairly neutral action, not strongly indicative of any particular political leaning. It's related to national security in a broad sense, but doesn't obviously expand executive power or federal authority. It doesn't touch on immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
