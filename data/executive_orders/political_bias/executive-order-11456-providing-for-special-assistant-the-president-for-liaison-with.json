    "critique": "This executive order establishes a Special Assistant to the President for Liaison with Former Presidents. It aims to maintain communication channels and seek advice from former presidents on major matters, particularly national security. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, or impact on civil liberties. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by creating a new position within the White House, but it's a relatively minor expansion. It doesn't seem to have a direct impact on federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
