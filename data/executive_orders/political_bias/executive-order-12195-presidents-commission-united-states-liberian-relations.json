    "critique": "This executive order establishes a commission to review and improve US-Liberian relations. It is difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt based on this document alone, as it focuses on diplomatic relations. The order doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a way that allows for a clear scoring. The order itself does grant the president power to appoint members to the commission, but this is a fairly standard function for executive orders of this nature. The impact on the other axes is negligible. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
