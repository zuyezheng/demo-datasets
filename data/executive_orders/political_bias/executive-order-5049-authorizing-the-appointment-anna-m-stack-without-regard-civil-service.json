    "critique": "This document is a presidential order granting an exception to civil service rules for a specific individual. It's difficult to assess its position on broad ideological or policy axes. The order seems to be based on a personal connection rather than a matter of policy. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The only axis that this document has a slight impact on is executive power, as it is an example of the executive branch using its power to make an exception to existing rules.",
