    "critique": "The document establishes a board to investigate disputes between National Airlines and its employees, represented by labor organizations. It aims to prevent interruption of interstate commerce and essential transportation services. The order temporarily prevents changes to the conditions out of which the disputes arose, pending the board's report. This leans towards government intervention in labor disputes to maintain economic stability.",
