    "critique": "This executive order strengthens the power of the National Labor Board and the Compliance Division of the National Recovery Administration to enforce Section 7(a) of the National Industrial Recovery Act, which guarantees workers the right to organize and bargain collectively. This suggests a leaning towards government intervention in the economy and support for labor rights, which aligns with a liberal ideology. The order doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in general, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. However, by bolstering the power of federal agencies to regulate labor practices, it implicitly favors federal control over state control in this area.",
