    "critique": "This document is an executive order issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, during the Great Depression. It regulates the hoarding, earmarking, and export of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates. It also regulates transactions in foreign exchange and transfers of credit, as well as the export or withdrawal of currency from the United States. The order grants broad powers to the Secretary of the Treasury to investigate, regulate, and prohibit these activities. The document reflects a significant expansion of executive power and federal control over the economy during a time of national emergency.",
