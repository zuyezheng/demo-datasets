    "critique": "This document focuses on port security and the screening of maritime workers. It expands the authority of the Commandant of the Coast Guard to ensure the security of vessels and waterfront facilities. The document prioritizes national security, potentially at the expense of individual liberties. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores reflect this assessment.",
