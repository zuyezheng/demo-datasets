    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 that revokes previous orders withdrawing public lands in Nevada and Utah for use as air-navigation sites. The land is no longer required for that purpose. It is a fairly technical document dealing with land management. It is difficult to assess a strong ideological tilt. It seems to have a slight deregulation aspect as it returns land to the public domain, but this is very minor. There is no clear impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores will be neutral.",
