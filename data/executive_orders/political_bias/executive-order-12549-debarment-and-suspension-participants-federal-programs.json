    "critique": "This executive order aims to curb fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal programs by establishing a government-wide system for debarment and suspension of participants. It mandates that agencies participate in this system, follow due process, and share information about debarred individuals. The order also establishes an interagency committee and directs the OMB to issue guidelines and monitor implementation. There is nothing explicitly ideological about this; it seems to be process-oriented. Immigration is not mentioned. It could be argued that this expands executive power slightly by centralizing control over debarment and suspension, but it also constrains agencies by requiring them to follow government-wide criteria. It leans towards federal primacy by establishing a government-wide system. It could be argued that this prioritizes national security by preventing fraud, waste, and abuse. It could be seen as promoting economic regulation by increasing agency accountability. It does not seem to directly address social inclusion.",
