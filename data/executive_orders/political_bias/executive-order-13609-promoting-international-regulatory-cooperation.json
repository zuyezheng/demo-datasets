    "critique": "This executive order focuses on international regulatory cooperation and aims to reduce unnecessary differences in regulatory requirements between the United States and its major trading partners. It emphasizes economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. It seems to promote deregulation by reducing unnecessary regulatory differences. It does not significantly expand executive power, but rather coordinates existing regulatory processes. It does not obviously favor either state or federal primacy. It is difficult to place on the traditional left-right spectrum, but its emphasis on economic growth and deregulation might suggest a slight conservative tilt.",
