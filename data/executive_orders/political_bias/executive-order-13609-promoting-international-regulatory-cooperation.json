    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on international regulatory cooperation. It aims to promote economic growth, innovation, and competitiveness by aligning U.S. regulatory approaches with those of foreign governments. The order emphasizes coordination among federal agencies and encourages consideration of international regulatory approaches. It does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or social inclusion. Therefore, the scores for these axes are neutral. The order promotes deregulation to reduce unnecessary differences in regulatory requirements, so the economic regulation score is negative. The ideological tilt is moderate as it seeks to balance economic growth with public health, welfare, safety, and the environment.",
