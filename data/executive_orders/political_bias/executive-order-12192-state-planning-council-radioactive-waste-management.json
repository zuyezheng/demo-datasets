    "critique": "This executive order establishes a council to advise the President and Secretary of Energy on nuclear waste management. It includes representatives from various levels of government (federal, state, tribal) and relevant agencies. The order emphasizes state and local involvement in nuclear waste management planning and siting. It does not directly address immigration, civil liberties vs. national security, or economic regulation. It seems to balance federal and state interests, leaning slightly towards federal control due to the federal agencies involved. It does not seem to have a strong ideological tilt. It promotes social inclusion by including tribal government representatives.",
