    "critique": "The document primarily concerns the temporary assignment of an Army officer to governmental corporations dealing with Inter-American affairs. There is a slight expansion of executive power through the detailing authorization, and a cooperative balance in federalism as it involves both federal departments and government corporations. The document has a moderate approach to economic regulation, as it pertains to government entities. It is neutral on social inclusion, security vs. liberty, and ideological tilt.",
