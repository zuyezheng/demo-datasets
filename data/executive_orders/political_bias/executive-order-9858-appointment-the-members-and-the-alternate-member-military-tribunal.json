    "critique": "This executive order establishes a military tribunal to try major war criminals of the European Axis following World War II. It designates specific individuals as members and an alternate member of the tribunal and authorizes the Secretaries of State, War, the Attorney General, and the Navy to provide assistance. The order does not directly address ideological tilts, immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that establishing a tribunal expands executive power, but it is also in line with international agreements and the prosecution of war crimes. The order does not directly impact federalism or national security vs. civil liberties within the US, but it does reflect a commitment to international justice and accountability for war crimes.",
