It does not contain any information related to ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order simply delegates authority within the existing structure of the Commerce Department. The only axis with a non-zero score is Executive Power, as it clarifies the line of succession.",
