    "critique": "This document approves a Code of Fair Competition for the Fishing Tackle Industry under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It reflects President Roosevelt's use of executive power to implement New Deal policies during the Great Depression. The code aims to regulate competition within the industry, indicating government intervention in the economy. The condition attached to the approval suggests a concern for fair access and preventing monopolies within the association. Given the context of the New Deal and the nature of the policy, I will score each axis accordingly.",
