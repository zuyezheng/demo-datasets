    "critique": "This document terminates a Naval Defensive Sea Area established in 1937 and amended in 1940 and 1946. It's a simple cancellation of a previous executive order. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
