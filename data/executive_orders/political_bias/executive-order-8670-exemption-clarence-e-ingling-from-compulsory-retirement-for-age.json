    "critique": "This is an executive order that exempts a White House employee from mandatory retirement. It's a fairly routine administrative action. There's no clear ideological tilt, immigration aspect, or impact on federalism. It doesn't obviously expand executive power beyond what's already legislated. It doesn't directly affect national security or civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
