    "critique": "This document describes the establishment of land for the Jicarilla Indian Reservation. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt without more context, but setting aside land for Native Americans could be seen as a slightly liberal action. The document does not directly address immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does shift control of the land to the federal government for the use of the Jicarilla tribe.",
