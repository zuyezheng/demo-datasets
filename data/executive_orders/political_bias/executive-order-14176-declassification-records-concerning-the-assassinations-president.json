    "critique": "This document is an executive order mandating the release of government records related to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. It emphasizes transparency and the public interest in understanding these historical events. The order directs the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General to develop plans for the full release of these records. There is nothing particularly liberal or conservative about releasing old assassination records. It does not touch on immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It could be argued that it slightly curtails executive power by mandating transparency, but it also uses executive power to mandate the release of documents. It does not obviously favor the federal government over the state governments. It could be argued that it favors civil liberties by promoting transparency, but it also acknowledges the need to protect national security. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
