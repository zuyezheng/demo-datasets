    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the declassification and release of records related to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It emphasizes transparency and the public interest in disclosing these records. There is no apparent shift in economic regulation, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or social inclusion. The document does not explicitly address immigration. The ideological tilt is neutral, as it focuses on transparency and historical record release.",
