    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding land withdrawal in California for use by the Department of Agriculture in connection with the administration of Cleveland National Forest. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The federal government is exercising its power over land, which could be interpreted as a slight increase in federal control.",
