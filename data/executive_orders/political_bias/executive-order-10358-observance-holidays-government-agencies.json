    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the observance of holidays by federal employees. It primarily addresses the situation when a holiday falls on a Sunday and clarifies how federal offices and employees should handle such situations. There's nothing inherently ideological about this; it's a matter of logistical coordination for government operations. It doesn't touch on immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
