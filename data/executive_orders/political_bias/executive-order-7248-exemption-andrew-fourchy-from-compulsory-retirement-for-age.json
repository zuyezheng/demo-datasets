    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1935 exempting an engineer from mandatory retirement. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of such a document, but it seems relatively neutral. Immigration is not addressed. The order expands executive power slightly by using an exemption clause. Federalism is not really impacted. National security vs. civil liberties is not a major factor. Economic regulation is not directly addressed, but allowing someone to continue working could be seen as a minor intervention. Social inclusion is not really relevant here.",
