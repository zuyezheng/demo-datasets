    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the assignment of radio frequencies to government radio stations. It specifically amends a previous order to delete the assignment of 68 kc to the Navy. Given the limited scope and technical nature of the order, it has minimal implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, and social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 0.",
