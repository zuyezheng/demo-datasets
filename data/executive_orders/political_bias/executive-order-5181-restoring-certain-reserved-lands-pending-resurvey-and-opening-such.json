    "critique": "This executive order concerns the revocation of a previous order withdrawing public lands in Wyoming and opening them to entry under homestead or desert land laws, primarily for ex-service men of the War with Germany. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power expansion, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. The focus is on land management and allocation to veterans. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The federalism aspect is slightly tilted towards federal control as it involves federal lands and regulations.",
