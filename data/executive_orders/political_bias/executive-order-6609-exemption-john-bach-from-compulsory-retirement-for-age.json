    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1934 exempting a specific individual from mandatory retirement. It's a fairly narrow action. There's no clear ideological tilt. It doesn't deal with immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does expand executive power slightly by using a provision to exempt someone from a rule, but it's a very specific case.",
