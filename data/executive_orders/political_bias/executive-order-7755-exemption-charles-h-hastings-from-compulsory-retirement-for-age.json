    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1937 exempting a specific person from mandatory retirement. It's a very specific action with limited scope. Ideologically, it doesn't lean strongly in either direction. It has no implications for immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The executive power aspect is slightly expanded as it uses the power to exempt someone, but it's a power already granted by law.",
