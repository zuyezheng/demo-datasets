    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating authority to the United States Civil Service Commission and revoking some older executive orders. It seems to deal with federal employees working with international organizations. There's not much here to suggest a strong ideological tilt. It's primarily administrative. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is neither strongly expanded nor restricted; it's a delegation of existing authority. Federalism isn't really impacted. National security vs. civil liberties is not a major theme. Economic regulation is not directly affected. Social inclusion is not a primary focus.",
