    "critique": "This document amends the Selective Service Regulations of 1948. It primarily focuses on defining terms like \"Governor\" and \"State\" to include territories and possessions of the United States, and it outlines exemptions for certain aliens from registration and service. It also addresses procedures for registrants leaving the United States and appeal processes. The document itself doesn't express a strong ideological stance. It expands federal control by including territories under Selective Service. It balances national security with some exemptions for aliens. It has a moderate impact on immigration by defining who is exempt. It doesn't directly regulate the economy or address social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
