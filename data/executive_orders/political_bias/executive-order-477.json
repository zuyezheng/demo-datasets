    "critique": "This document is a resolution by Congress to honor Brigadier-General Nathaniel Lyon and the officers and soldiers under his command at the battle of Springfield, Missouri. It expresses gratitude and orders that each regiment engaged shall be authorized to bear upon its colors the word \"Springfield,\" embroidered in letters of gold. The President is requested to cause these resolutions to be read at the head of every regiment in the Army of the United States. There is nothing about immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document is a historical record of the Civil War era. It is difficult to assign a score on the ideological tilt axis, but I will assign a 0 as it is a historical document. Therefore, the initial scores are: Ideological Tilt: 0, Immigration Approach: 0, Executive Power: 0, Federalism: 0, National Security vs. Civil Liberties: 0, Economic Regulation: 0, Social Inclusion: 0. After further consideration, I will revise the score for ideological tilt to -1, as honoring a Union general in the Civil War could be seen as a conservative position.",
