    "critique": "This executive order establishes a reservation for the Mescalero Apaches. This action could be seen as promoting social inclusion by protecting the interests and land of a Native American tribe. However, it also involves the federal government in land management and potentially restricts the use of that land for other purposes. The order cancels a previous order, indicating a shift in policy. Given the historical context of the late 19th century, such actions were often part of a larger policy of assimilation and control over Native American populations, which complicates the assessment of its intent and impact.",
