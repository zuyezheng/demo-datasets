    "critique": "This document is a transfer of land from federal to territorial control. It is difficult to assess any ideological tilt. It returns land to the Territory of Hawaii, indicating a slight move towards state control. It does not obviously affect civil liberties, immigration, or economic regulation. It has no impact on social inclusion. It is a minor expansion of executive power.",
