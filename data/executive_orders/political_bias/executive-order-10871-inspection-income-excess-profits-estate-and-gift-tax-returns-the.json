    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1960 authorizing the House Committee on Public Works to inspect certain tax returns for the years 1950-1959. It relates to an investigation of the Federal-aid highway program. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, or social inclusion. The order does grant access to private tax information, which could be seen as a minor infringement on privacy, but it is for a specific investigation and time period. It could be argued that allowing the House committee access expands executive power, but it is more accurately described as inter-branch cooperation. The order does not seem to have any impact on economic regulation or federalism.",
