    "critique": "This document is a directive to close government departments for Memorial Day. It honors soldiers who died in the Civil War. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, executive power changes, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion/exclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight tilt towards traditional values, but it's very weak.",
