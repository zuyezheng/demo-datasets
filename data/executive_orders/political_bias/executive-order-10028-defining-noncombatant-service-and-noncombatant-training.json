    "critique": "The document defines noncombatant service and training within the Selective Service Act, focusing on exemptions from bearing arms. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores are neutral. The security/liberty axis leans slightly towards liberty as it provides exemptions based on personal beliefs.",
