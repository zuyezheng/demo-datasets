    "critique": "This document defines \"noncombatant service\" and \"noncombatant training\" within the context of the Selective Service Act of 1948. It outlines specific roles and training that do not involve the use of arms, catering to individuals who may object to combat due to religious or moral beliefs. The document itself doesn't express a strong ideological tilt, but its existence acknowledges and accommodates diverse beliefs regarding military service. It doesn't directly impact immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion in a significant way. Therefore, most axes would be scored as neutral.",
