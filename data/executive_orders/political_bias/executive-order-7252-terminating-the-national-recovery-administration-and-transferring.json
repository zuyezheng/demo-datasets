    "critique": "The document describes the termination of the National Recovery Administration and the transfer of its divisions to the Departments of Commerce and Labor. This suggests a shift away from centralized economic planning and towards a more decentralized approach. The order also specifies that transferred personnel do not acquire civil service status and new appointments can be made without regard to civil service rules, indicating a potential weakening of established bureaucratic procedures.",
