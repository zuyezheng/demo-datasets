    "critique": "This document designates several international organizations as public international organizations entitled to enjoy certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. It does not seem to obviously lean left or right (ideological tilt). It does not directly address immigration. It does not expand executive power, but rather implements existing laws. It does not obviously shift power between state and federal governments. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It does not directly regulate the economy. It does not obviously promote or discourage social inclusion or diversity.",
