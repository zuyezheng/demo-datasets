    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1929 that amends previous executive orders to correct the description of land designated for military purposes in Hawaii. It involves surveying and precise land measurements. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order does not obviously expand executive power; it simply corrects a land description. It could be argued that setting aside land for military purposes implies a focus on national security, but the document itself is purely administrative. Similarly, the federal government is exercising its authority over territory, but this is not necessarily an expansion of federal power beyond the status quo. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
