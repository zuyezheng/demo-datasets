McGurty to be appointed as a clerk in the New York Post Office, due to her being the widow of a long-time Postal Service employee and lacking adequate means of support. It is a specific case of social welfare. It does not touch on immigration, executive power in general, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or broad social inclusion policies. The ideological tilt is slightly liberal due to the social welfare aspect.",
