    "critique": "The first document is an order to transfer military personnel to different commands. The second document outlines rules for civil service examinations. There is nothing particularly ideological about these documents. The civil service rules aim to create a meritocracy and prevent discrimination based on political or religious affiliation. The rules do not touch on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
