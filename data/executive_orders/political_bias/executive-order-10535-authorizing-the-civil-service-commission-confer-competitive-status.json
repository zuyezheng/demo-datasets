    "critique": "This executive order addresses the acquisition of competitive status for government employees who met the requirements but were not recommended due to administrative error. It allows the Civil Service Commission to confer competitive status upon recommendation by the agency. The order does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order seems to correct an administrative oversight, so it doesn't strongly restrain or expand executive authority.",
