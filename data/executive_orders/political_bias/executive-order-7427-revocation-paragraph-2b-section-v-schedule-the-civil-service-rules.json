    "critique": "The document concerns the reclassification of certain positions at the US Naval Academy from excepted to competitive within the civil service. This suggests a move towards standardization and potentially greater job security for the employees in question. There is no readily apparent stance on immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or social inclusion. The action could be interpreted as a slight move towards economic regulation in the sense that civil service positions often have more standardized pay and benefits compared to non-classified positions.",
