    "critique": "This document is an executive order regarding the Committee for Reciprocity Information and the Executive Committee on Commercial Policy. It primarily concerns the transfer of jurisdiction and control of the Committee for Reciprocity Information to the Department of State, under the supervision of the Secretary of State. It also reaffirms the function of the Executive Committee on Commercial Policy in selecting members for the Committee for Reciprocity Information. There is no direct mention of immigration, civil liberties, or social issues. The order seems to be an administrative adjustment related to trade and commercial policy.",
