    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1932 that temporarily withdraws land in Wisconsin from settlement for classification and potential inclusion in a national forest. It cites the act of Congress approved June 25, 1910, as amended by the act of August 24, 1912, as its authority. There is nothing to suggest a liberal or conservative ideological tilt. It does not relate to immigration. It does not expand executive power because it is authorized by pre-existing congressional legislation. It arguably centralizes power in the federal government, but only to a small degree. It does not relate to national security or civil liberties. It could be seen as a very slight intervention in the economy, but it is primarily related to land management. It does not relate to social inclusion.",
