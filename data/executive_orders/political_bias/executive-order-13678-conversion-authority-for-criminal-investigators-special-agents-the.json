    "critique": "The document pertains to internal administrative matters regarding the hiring and conversion of ATF criminal investigators. It provides conversion authority for these investigators, allowing them to be converted non-competitively to career appointments after 3 years of satisfactory service. This seems to be an effort to streamline the hiring process and make the ATF more competitive. There is nothing explicitly ideological in this document. It does not touch on immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight increase in executive power, but it's very minimal.",
