    "critique": "The document establishes a board to investigate a dispute between a railway company and its employees' union. It aims to prevent interruption of interstate commerce and ensure essential transportation services. The order is neutral in ideological tilt, immigration, security vs. liberty, economic regulation and social inclusion. It expands executive power by creating a board and intervening in the dispute. It also leans towards federal control by invoking the Railway Labor Act.",
