    "critique": "The document is an executive order imposing sanctions on Iran. It blocks property and interests in property of the Government of Iran, including the Central Bank of Iran, that are in the United States. It also prohibits donations to or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked. The order is intended to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995, particularly in light of the deceptive practices of the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian banks to conceal transactions of sanctioned parties, the deficiencies in Iran's anti-money laundering regime and the weaknesses in its implementation, and the continuing and unacceptable risk posed to the international financial system by Iran's activities.",
