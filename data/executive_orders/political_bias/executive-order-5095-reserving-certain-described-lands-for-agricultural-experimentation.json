    "critique": "This document establishes a wildlife reservation on Nunivak Island in Alaska. It prioritizes conservation and scientific research related to reindeer, caribou, musk ox, birds, and other animals. It restricts settlement, hunting, and other activities that could harm the environment or wildlife. The order also makes exceptions for lighthouse, military, naval, and educational purposes. It does not seem to obviously lean left or right. The executive power is expanded slightly by creating this reservation. Federalism is expanded slightly as well. National security is not really implicated. Economic regulation is slightly interventionist. Social inclusion is neutral.",
