    "critique": "This executive order establishes procedures for asserting executive privilege regarding Presidential records. It outlines the roles of the Archivist, incumbent President, former President, Attorney General, and Counsel to the President in the process. The order aims to balance transparency with the need to protect national security, law enforcement, and the deliberative processes of the executive branch. It revokes a previous executive order on the same topic. It does not seem to obviously lean left or right. It seems to expand executive power slightly by reinforcing the ability to invoke executive privilege. It seems to favor the federal government. It seems to balance national security and civil liberties. It does not seem to affect economic regulation. It does not seem to affect social inclusion.",
