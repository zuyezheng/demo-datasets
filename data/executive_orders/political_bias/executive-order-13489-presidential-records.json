    "critique": "The document outlines procedures for asserting executive privilege, balancing the interests of incumbent and former presidents with the public's right to access presidential records. It leans towards expanding executive power by allowing the President to invoke executive privilege, but also includes checks and balances through consultation with the Attorney General and potential judicial review. The document does not directly address economic regulation, social inclusion, immigration, or ideological tilt.",
