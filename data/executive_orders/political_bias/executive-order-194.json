It aims to standardize employment practices and ensure appointments are based on merit through examinations, reflecting a move towards structured governance and potentially limiting arbitrary appointments. The document doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power, or social inclusion, focusing instead on bureaucratic organization and civil service regulations.",
