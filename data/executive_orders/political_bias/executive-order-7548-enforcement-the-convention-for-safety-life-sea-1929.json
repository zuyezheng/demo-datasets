    "critique": "This document primarily concerns the implementation of an international maritime safety convention within the US government. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of various federal agencies in fulfilling the obligations of the Safety of Life at Sea Convention. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, as it focuses on practical coordination between departments. Immigration is not addressed. Executive power is neither significantly expanded nor restricted; it's more about clarifying existing roles. Federalism is slightly strengthened as the federal government takes on the responsibility of adhering to the international treaty. The document doesn't directly address national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
