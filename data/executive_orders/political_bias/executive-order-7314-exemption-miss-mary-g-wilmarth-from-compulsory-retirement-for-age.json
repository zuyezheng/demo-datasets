    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1936 that allows a specific person to continue in their role despite having reached the retirement age. It is a very specific action, and doesn't have broad implications for any of the axes. It is hard to place this document on the ideological spectrum. It does give the executive branch the power to make exceptions, but it is a very narrow case. There is no impact on immigration, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion.",
