    "critique": "This executive order terminates the National Recovery Review Board, which was established under the National Industrial Recovery Act. This act was part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program. The document itself doesn't express a strong ideological stance, but its context within the New Deal suggests a moderate level of government intervention in the economy. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. Therefore, these axes should be scored as neutral. The termination of the board could be seen as a slight move towards less intervention, but it's primarily an administrative decision.",
