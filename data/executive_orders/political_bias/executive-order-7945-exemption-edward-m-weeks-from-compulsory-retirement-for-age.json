    "critique": "This is an executive order that exempts an employee from compulsory retirement. It is a very specific action pertaining to one individual. There is no clear indication of broad ideological leaning, immigration policy, or impact on civil liberties. It does not seem to expand executive power in any significant way, as it is based on existing legislation. It doesn't obviously affect federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
