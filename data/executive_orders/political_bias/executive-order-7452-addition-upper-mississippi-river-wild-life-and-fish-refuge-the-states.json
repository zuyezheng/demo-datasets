    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1936 that reserves land for a wildlife refuge. It does not deal with immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It is a conservation effort, which could be seen as slightly liberal, but it's primarily a non-ideological issue. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
