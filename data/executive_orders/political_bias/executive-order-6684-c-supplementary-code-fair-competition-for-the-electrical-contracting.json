    "critique": "This document pertains to the National Industrial Recovery Act during the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. It approves the Electrical Contracting Chapter of the Code of Fair Competition for the Construction Industry. Given the context of the New Deal era, the document likely reflects a liberal approach to economic regulation and federal oversight. There is no information related to immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. The document expands executive power by implementing the NIRA. The federal government is taking control over industry standards.",
