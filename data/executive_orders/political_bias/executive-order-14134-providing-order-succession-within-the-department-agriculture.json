    "critique": "This executive order establishes the order of succession within the Department of Agriculture. It is primarily an administrative action, updating the line of succession. There is little to no impact on ideological tilt, immigration, economic regulation, social inclusion, or national security vs. civil liberties. It has a neutral impact on federalism. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by clarifying the line of succession, but it is a very minor effect.",
