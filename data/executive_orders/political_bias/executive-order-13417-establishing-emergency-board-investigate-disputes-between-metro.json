    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between Metro-North Railroad and its employees. It is a fairly procedural action, invoking the Railway Labor Act. There's little to suggest a strong ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on social inclusion. The executive power is being used as prescribed by law, so it's neutral in that regard. Federalism isn't strongly affected, nor is national security vs. civil liberties. Economic regulation is indirectly touched upon through labor relations, but not significantly. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
