    "critique": "This document establishes an emergency board to investigate a labor dispute between the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation and its employees. It is based on the Railway Labor Act. The order itself doesn't express a clear ideological tilt. It seems to be a fairly standard action related to labor disputes and doesn't touch on immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security, or social inclusion. It has a slight impact on economic regulation, as it prevents changes to the conditions out of which the dispute arose for 120 days.",
