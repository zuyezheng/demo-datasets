    "critique": "This document establishes a Board of Inquiry to address labor disputes at General Electric, citing concerns about the impact on national safety due to the company's role in military industries. It invokes Section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. The document itself doesn't express a clear ideological stance but rather focuses on resolving a labor dispute with potential national security implications. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, or social inclusion. The primary focus is on economic regulation through intervention in a labor dispute and national security. Therefore, the initial scores reflect this specific context.",
