    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the administration of customs ports of entry. It suspends a previous order that abolished two customs ports. This action appears to be primarily administrative and economic in nature, with minimal implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. The suspension could be interpreted as a slight intervention in economic regulation, but it's not substantial enough to warrant a strong score. Therefore, most axes will be scored as neutral.",
