    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the closure of government offices on December 24, 1940. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order provides a minor benefit to federal employees, which could be interpreted as a very slight intervention, but it's negligible.",
