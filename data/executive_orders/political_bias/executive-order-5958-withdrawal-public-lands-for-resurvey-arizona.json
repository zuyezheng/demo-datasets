    "critique": "This document is a land withdrawal order from 1932, signed by the President. It withdraws public lands in Arizona from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation pending a resurvey. It cites the act of June 25, 1910, as amended by the act of August 24, 1912, and the act of March 3, 1909, as the authority for this action. The order remains in effect until revoked by the President or Congress.\n\nIdeological Tilt: This document does not directly address typical left-right political issues. It's a land management decision, so it's ideologically neutral. Score: 0\nImmigration Approach: The document does not relate to immigration. Score: 0\nExecutive Power: The order is an exercise of executive power, but it also states that Congress can revoke it, suggesting a balance. Score: 0\nFederalism: The order involves federal land in a state, indicating federal control over federal lands, but it doesn't necessarily shift the balance of power significantly. Score: 0\nNational Security vs. Civil Liberties: The document does not implicate national security or civil liberties. Score: 0\nEconomic Regulation: The order withdraws land from economic activities like settlement and sale, which could be seen as a form of intervention, but it's primarily for a resurvey. Score: 0\nSocial Inclusion: The document does not address social inclusion issues. Score: 0",
