    "critique": "This executive order is a minor administrative update, renaming and re-establishing a service certificate and badge for military personnel assigned to the White House. It does not touch on any major political issues or ideological debates. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. There's no impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The ideological tilt is also neutral as it doesn't promote any particular political ideology.",
