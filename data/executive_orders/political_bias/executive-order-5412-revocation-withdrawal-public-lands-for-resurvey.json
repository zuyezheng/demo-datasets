    "critique": "This document concerns the revocation of a previous executive order regarding public lands in New Mexico and their subsequent opening for homesteading and desert land laws, primarily for ex-service men. It's a very specific action related to land management and doesn't touch on broad ideological themes. Therefore, most axes should be close to neutral. The federalism aspect is slightly towards federal control as it involves federal lands and regulations.",
