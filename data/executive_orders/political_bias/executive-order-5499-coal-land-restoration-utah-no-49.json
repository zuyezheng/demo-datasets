    "critique": "This document is a land order related to coal classification. It revokes previous orders to allow the Director of the Geological Survey to classify lands. It is difficult to assess its ideological tilt, immigration approach, impact on executive power, or effect on social inclusion. It appears to shift control to the federal government, and it may have a slight deregulation effect by opening up land for coal classification.",
