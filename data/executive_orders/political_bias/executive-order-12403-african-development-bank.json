    "critique": "This executive order designates the African Development Bank as a public international organization, entitling it to certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. It also delegates certain functions to the Secretary of the Treasury. There is no clear indication of a liberal or conservative ideological tilt. The order does not directly address immigration. It does not appear to expand executive power significantly, as it mainly involves designating an organization and delegating existing functions. It does not obviously shift power between the federal and state governments. It does not directly address national security or civil liberties. It does not directly regulate the economy. It does not directly address social inclusion or diversity. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
