It shifts some duties related to hospitalization to the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs while retaining some authority with the Secretary concerned, especially for those with longer service or specific conditions. There's no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or social inclusion. The focus is on the division of responsibilities between different government entities.",
