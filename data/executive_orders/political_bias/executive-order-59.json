    "critique": "This executive order sets aside land for the use and occupancy of Mohave-Apache Indians and other Indians deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Interior. This action suggests a focus on social inclusion and the rights of indigenous peoples. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power dynamics, federalism implications, national security concerns, or economic regulation. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral, with a positive score for social inclusion.",
