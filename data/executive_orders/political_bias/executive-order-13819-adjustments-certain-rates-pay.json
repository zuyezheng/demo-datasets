    "critique": "This document primarily deals with setting pay scales for government employees, military personnel, and members of the judiciary. It does not touch upon topics like immigration, civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The document itself doesn't expand executive power, but it is an executive order, so it has a slight tendency to expand executive power, but this is not the main purpose of the document. It does not seem to have any ideological tilt.",
