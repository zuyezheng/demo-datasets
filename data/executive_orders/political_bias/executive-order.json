    "critique": "This document is a eulogy for Major-General Brown, issued by the Department of War. It primarily focuses on praising his military service, valor, and character. There is minimal to no information related to the axes of political bias. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The language used is formal and reflects the time period. There's a slight emphasis on traditional values (valor, sacrifice), but not enough to significantly skew the social inclusion score. There is no mention of immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, or economic regulation.",
