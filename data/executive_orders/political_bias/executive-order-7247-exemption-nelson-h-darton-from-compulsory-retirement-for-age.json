    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1935 exempting a geologist from mandatory retirement. It's a fairly specific action with limited implications for broader political issues. It doesn't touch on immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does grant the executive branch some power, but it's a power already granted by law. There's no clear ideological tilt.",
