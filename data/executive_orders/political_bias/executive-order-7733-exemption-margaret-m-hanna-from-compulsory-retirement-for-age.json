    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1937 that allows a specific government employee to continue working past the retirement age. It is a very specific action, and doesn't have broad implications for any of the axes. The ideological tilt is neutral as it doesn't promote any particular ideology. The immigration approach is irrelevant. The executive power is slightly expanded as the president is using their authority to make an exception to a rule, but it is a limited and specific case. The federalism aspect is neutral. The national security vs. civil liberties aspect is irrelevant. The economic regulation aspect is neutral. The social inclusion aspect is neutral.",
