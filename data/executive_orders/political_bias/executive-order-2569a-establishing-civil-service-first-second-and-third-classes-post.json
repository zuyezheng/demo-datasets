    "critique": "The document discusses filling postmaster positions through civil service examinations. This suggests a move towards a merit-based system, potentially reducing political patronage. The restriction against those over 65 could be seen as ageist but also as a way to ensure a more active workforce. The move to use civil service examinations suggests a slight shift towards federal control and away from patronage, and a neutral stance on other issues.",
