    "critique": "The document outlines the order of succession within the Department of Defense. It does not express opinions on ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The document focuses on the chain of command in the event of the Secretary of Defense's absence or inability to serve. It could be argued that it expands executive power, but only in a very limited, procedural sense.",
