    "critique": "The document is an executive order that reconstitutes the National Industrial Recovery Board. It does not directly address ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. However, it does relate to economic regulation as it pertains to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The document itself doesn't expand executive power, it just appoints people to a board. The NIRA itself was an example of government intervention in the economy. Therefore, the economic regulation score should be positive.",
