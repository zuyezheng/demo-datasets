    "critique": "This document is an executive order granting classified status to a specific employee, Jose T. Casanovas, in the Quartermaster Corps of the Army in Porto Rico. The rationale provided is his long, faithful, and efficient service. This is a very specific and narrow action. It doesn't seem to have broad implications for ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral. The only possible exception might be a slight lean towards expanding executive power, as it's a direct intervention in personnel matters, but it's so minor that it's essentially neutral.",
