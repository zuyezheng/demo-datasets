This appears to be an administrative action to comply with an international treaty. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, expansion of executive power, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
