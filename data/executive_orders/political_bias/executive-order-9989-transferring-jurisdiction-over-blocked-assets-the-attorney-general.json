    "critique": "This executive order deals with the transfer of control over blocked foreign assets from the Treasury Department to the Attorney General after the end of World War II. It doesn't directly address ideological issues, immigration, or social inclusion. It centralizes power in the executive branch by giving the Attorney General control over these assets, which could be seen as an expansion of executive power. It also involves the federal government in economic matters by controlling foreign assets. There is no clear indication about civil liberties or state vs federal control beyond the executive power. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:",
