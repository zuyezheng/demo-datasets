    "critique": "This is an executive order from 1940 that exempts a special agent from the FBI from mandatory retirement for one year. It is difficult to assess the ideological tilt of this document, but it seems fairly neutral. The order does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of these axes should be scored as neutral.",
