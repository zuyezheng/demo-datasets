    "critique": "This executive order amends a previous order regarding White House Fellows. It clarifies eligibility criteria and assignment locations. There's no indication of ideological bias, immigration stance, or impact on federalism. It doesn't significantly expand executive power, as it's merely modifying an existing program. It doesn't touch upon national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
