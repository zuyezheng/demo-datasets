    "critique": "The document advocates for returning both Union and Confederate flags to their respective states, promoting reconciliation and unity after the Civil War. It emphasizes moving past internecine conflict and highlights the reintegration of Confederate leaders into national affairs. The document does not directly address economic regulation, executive power, federalism, immigration, security/liberty, or social inclusion, so these aspects are scored as neutral. The overall tone suggests a desire for national healing and unity, without leaning heavily on any particular political ideology.",
