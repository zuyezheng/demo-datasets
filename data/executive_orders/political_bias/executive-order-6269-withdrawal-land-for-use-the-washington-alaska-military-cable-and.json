Given its focus on military communications infrastructure, it has implications for national security and federal land management. There is no direct indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or social inclusion. The order centralizes control over the land with the federal government. The economic impact is minimal, relating only to the specific land use for a telegraph company. The executive power is used to reserve land, which is a fairly standard function.
