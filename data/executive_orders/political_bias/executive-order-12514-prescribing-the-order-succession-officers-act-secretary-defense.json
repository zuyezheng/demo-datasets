    "critique": "This executive order establishes the line of succession for the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, and Secretary of the Air Force. It does not touch upon ideological issues, immigration, or civil liberties. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by allowing the President to vary the order of succession, but this is a minor point. It has no implications for economic regulation or social inclusion. It also doesn't really affect federalism, as it's dealing with internal procedures within the federal government. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
