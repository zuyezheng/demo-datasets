    "critique": "This document concerns the revocation of land withdrawals related to power sites in Montana. Given its focus on land management and rescinding previous executive orders related to power sites, the document has minimal ideological content. It appears to be an administrative action with little direct impact on immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
