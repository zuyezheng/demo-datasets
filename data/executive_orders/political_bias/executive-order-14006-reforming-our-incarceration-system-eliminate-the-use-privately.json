    "critique": "This executive order focuses on reducing the federal government's reliance on privately operated criminal detention facilities. It emphasizes rehabilitation, safe and humane treatment, and reintegration into communities. It does not explicitly address immigration, executive power, or federalism. It could be seen as slightly liberal in its approach to criminal justice reform and social inclusion. It also involves some government intervention in the market for prisons.",
