    "critique": "This document is a public announcement from the President via the War Department during the Civil War. It expresses gratitude and acknowledges the sacrifices made by the Union Army. It does not contain specific policy proposals or regulations, so most axes will be close to neutral. The exception might be social inclusion, which could be seen as slightly leaning towards conformity given the context of national unity during wartime.",
