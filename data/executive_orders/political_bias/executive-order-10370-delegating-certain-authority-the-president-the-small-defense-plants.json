    "critique": "The document delegates authority to the Small Defense Plants Administrator regarding voluntary agreements and programs related to small-business production pools under the Defense Production Act. It emphasizes consultation with the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and requires approval from the Attorney General for certain requests. The order also allows for redelegation of authority. There is a slight emphasis on federal control and economic regulation due to the nature of the Defense Production Act.",
