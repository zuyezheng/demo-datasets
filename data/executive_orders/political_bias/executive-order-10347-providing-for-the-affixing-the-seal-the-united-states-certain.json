    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1952 that authorizes the Secretary of State to affix the Seal of the United States to certain documents. It seems largely procedural. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on civil liberties. It doesn't seem to expand executive power significantly, as it's mainly about streamlining the process of affixing the seal. It doesn't directly address federalism, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
