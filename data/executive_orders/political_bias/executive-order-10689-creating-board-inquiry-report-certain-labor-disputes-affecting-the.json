    "critique": "This document establishes a Board of Inquiry to address labor disputes in the maritime industry, invoking the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947. It doesn't directly address ideological tilts, immigration, or social inclusion. The executive power is moderately expanded to address a strike that could impact national health and safety. Federalism isn't significantly affected. National security is indirectly addressed through economic stability. Economic regulation is moderately interventionist to resolve the labor dispute.",
