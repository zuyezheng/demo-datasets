It invokes the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, citing concerns about national health and safety due to a strike. There is no explicit discussion of immigration, executive power, federalism, security vs. liberty, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, the initial scores are set to neutral across all axes.",
