    "critique": "This document pertains to the modification of the Crook National Forest boundaries in Arizona and the reservation of excluded lands for townsite purposes. Given the subject matter, several axes are not applicable or have a neutral score. There's no indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion or restriction, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation, or social inclusion/conformity. The only axis with a potential score is federalism. Since the order modifies land use within a state based on a federal act and the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, it suggests a degree of federal oversight, but it's not a strong assertion of federal control. Therefore, a slightly positive score is appropriate.",
