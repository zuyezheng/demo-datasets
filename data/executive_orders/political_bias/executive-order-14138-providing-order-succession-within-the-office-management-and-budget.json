    "critique": "This executive order establishes the order of succession within the Office of Management and Budget. It is primarily an administrative action with little direct impact on ideological or political issues. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The order revokes a previous order (Executive Order 13615), indicating a routine update rather than a significant policy shift.",
