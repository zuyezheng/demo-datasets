    "critique": "This executive order, issued by George W. Bush, focuses on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It expands on previous orders (12938 and 13094) by blocking the property of individuals and entities providing support to proliferation activities. The order grants broad authority to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other agencies, to implement these measures. It also includes a determination that prior notice to affected parties would render the measures ineffectual. The order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits. It is difficult to assess its position on the traditional left-right political spectrum. It does not directly address immigration. It expands executive power by granting broad authority to the Secretary of the Treasury. It centralizes authority in the federal government. It prioritizes national security. It involves the government in economic matters by blocking property. It does not directly address social inclusion.",
