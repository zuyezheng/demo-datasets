    "critique": "This document is a simple military order assigning Ulysses S. Grant to command of the Union armies during the Civil War. It is based on an act of Congress, so it does not expand executive power. It has no bearing on immigration, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It is related to federalism because the Union army is a federal entity, but it does not significantly shift the balance of power between the states and the federal government. It is related to national security, but it does not obviously prioritize national security at the expense of civil liberties. It does not have a clear ideological tilt.",
