    "critique": "This document is an amendment to a previous executive order that suspends a provision restricting the number of Navy and Marine Corps officers who may be recommended for promotion. It does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, executive power in a broad sense, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral. The change relates to internal military promotions, so it's difficult to assign a strong political leaning.",
