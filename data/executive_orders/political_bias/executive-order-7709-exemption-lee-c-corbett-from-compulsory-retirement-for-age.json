    "critique": "This is a very specific action, an executive order to allow one person to continue in their role past the usual retirement age. It is difficult to extract broad political meaning from such a narrow action. Most axes are therefore neutral. The only one that could be argued either way is executive power, but I will leave it at neutral because it is a very specific exemption, not a general expansion of power.",
