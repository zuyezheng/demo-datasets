    "critique": "This document is a short executive order that allows the Director of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection to appoint a private secretary without following civil service rules. This appears to be a minor administrative exception. It's difficult to assess its impact on most of the axes due to its narrow scope. It doesn't seem to have a strong ideological tilt, immigration implications, or significant effects on federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The primary impact seems to be a slight expansion of executive power, as it grants an exception to established rules.",
