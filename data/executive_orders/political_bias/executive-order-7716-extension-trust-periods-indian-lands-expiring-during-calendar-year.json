    "critique": "This executive order extends trust periods for Indian lands. This seems to be a continuation of existing policy, so it's hard to place on the ideological spectrum. It does not seem to relate to immigration, executive power, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It does relate to federalism, as it concerns the relationship between the federal government and Native American tribes. Since the federal government is extending the trust, this indicates strong federal control.",
