    "critique": "This executive order establishes an Interagency Committee on International Athletics to collect and review information concerning amateur athletic matters that might affect foreign relations or the general welfare of the United States. It seems to promote international goodwill through athletic competitions and seeks advice from various departments and agencies. There's no clear indication of a liberal or conservative tilt. The order doesn't directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
