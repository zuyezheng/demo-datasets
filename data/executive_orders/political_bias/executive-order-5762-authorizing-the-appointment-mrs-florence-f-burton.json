    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1931 regarding the appointment of Mrs. Florence F. Burton as secretary to the Director of Prohibition. It waives civil service rules for this appointment based on the recommendation of the Attorney General and the Civil Service Commission's concurrence, stating it's in the best interest of the Bureau of Prohibition. There's no clear ideological tilt, immigration stance, or impact on federalism. It doesn't directly address national security vs. civil liberties or economic regulation. It has a slight impact on executive power, as it is an executive order. It doesn't seem to promote or hinder social inclusion.",
