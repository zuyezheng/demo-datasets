    "critique": "This document is a revocation of previous executive orders regarding coal land withdrawals in Montana. It's a very specific action related to land management. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration policy, executive power expansion, national security concerns, or social inclusion. It seems primarily related to economic regulation (specifically, access to coal lands) and potentially federalism (depending on the original orders and the balance of power between the federal government and the state of Montana regarding land management). Given it revokes previous orders, it could be argued it leans slightly towards deregulation, but it's a very nuanced situation. It's difficult to assign strong scores on any of the axes without more context.",
