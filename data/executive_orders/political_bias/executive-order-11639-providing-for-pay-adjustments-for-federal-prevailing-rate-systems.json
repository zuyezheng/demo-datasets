It centralizes authority in the federal government, specifically the Civil Service Commission, to regulate pay in accordance with economic policies and guidelines set by the Pay Board. There is a focus on maintaining consistency with fiscal and economic policies, suggesting a moderate level of government intervention in the economy. The order does not directly address social issues, immigration, security, or executive power beyond pay administration.",
