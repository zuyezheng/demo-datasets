    "critique": "This executive order primarily deals with the design and procurement of the US flag following Hawaii's admission to the Union. It specifies the flag's design, dimensions, and authorized sizes for executive agencies. There's nothing inherently ideological about flag design or procurement. The order delegates some authority to the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of General Services for minor adjustments, but this doesn't significantly shift power dynamics. It's a largely administrative action. Therefore, most axes should be scored as neutral.",
