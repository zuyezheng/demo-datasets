    "critique": "This document is an executive order transferring control of land in Honolulu from the federal government to the Territory of Hawaii. It's a fairly technical document with no clear ideological slant. It involves a transfer of control from the federal government to the Territory of Hawaii, suggesting a slight move towards state control. There's no mention of immigration, civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most axes should be neutral.",
