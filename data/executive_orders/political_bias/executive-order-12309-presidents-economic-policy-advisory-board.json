    "critique": "This document is a very minor amendment to an existing executive order. It removes a restriction on who can be a member of the President's Economic Policy Advisory Board. It's difficult to assign strong scores on any of the axes, as the change is quite narrow. The removal of the restriction could be seen as slightly expanding executive power, but it's a very weak effect. Similarly, the economic regulation aspect is neutral, as the change doesn't directly impact economic policy. There's no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, federalism implications, security vs. liberty concerns, or social inclusion aspects.",
