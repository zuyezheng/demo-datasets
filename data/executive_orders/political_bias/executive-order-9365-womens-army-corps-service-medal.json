    "critique": "This document establishes the Women's Army Corps Service Medal. It recognizes the service of women in the military. There is little to analyze in terms of political bias. It seems largely neutral on most axes. The only axis that it seems to touch on is social inclusion, where it promotes the inclusion of women in the military, which can be seen as a move towards diversity and pluralism, though a small one.",
