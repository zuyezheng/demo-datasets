    "critique": "This document is an executive order from 1937 regarding land use in North Dakota. It revokes a previous order and temporarily withdraws certain lands for use and development by the Department of Agriculture for soil erosion control. There is a provision that mineral resources can still be prospected, located, developed, etc. The document itself doesn't express an opinion on ideological tilt, immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. It seems to be a fairly standard administrative action related to land management. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
