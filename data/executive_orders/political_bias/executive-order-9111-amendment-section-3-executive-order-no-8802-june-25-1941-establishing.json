    "critique": "The document amends a previous executive order regarding the Committee on Fair Employment Practice. This committee aims to prevent discrimination in employment, which aligns with social inclusion. The change in the number of committee members does not inherently indicate a shift in ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or economic regulation. Therefore, most axes should be neutral, with a slight positive score for social inclusion.",
