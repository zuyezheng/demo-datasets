It returns the administration to the Secretary of Labor from the Panama Canal Commission. There is no clear indication of ideological tilt, immigration approach, executive power expansion or restriction, federalism implications, national security vs. civil liberties concerns, economic regulation implications, or social inclusion considerations. Therefore, most scores should be neutral.",
