    "critique": "This document outlines the process for awarding life-saving medals under the Medals of Honor Act. It establishes procedures for application, investigation, review, and recommendation, involving the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Secretary of Commerce. There is no clear indication of ideological bias, immigration policy, or impacts on civil liberties. The document primarily concerns administrative processes and does not directly address economic regulation or social inclusion. It could be argued that it slightly expands executive power by detailing the President's role in approving designs and recommendations, but this is minimal. The federalism aspect is neutral as it involves federal agencies. Therefore, most scores should be close to zero.",
