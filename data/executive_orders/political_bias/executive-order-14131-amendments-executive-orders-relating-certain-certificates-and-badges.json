    "critique": "This executive order pertains to the Presidential Service Certificate and Badge, as well as the Vice Presidential Service Badge. It amends previous executive orders to update the criteria and procedures for awarding these recognitions to members of the United States Uniformed Services assigned to the White House Office, the Office of the Vice President, or related support roles. The order does not directly address ideological issues, immigration, or economic regulation. It has a neutral impact on federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, and social inclusion. The order could be seen as a slight expansion of executive power, as it refines the criteria for presidential and vice-presidential recognition, but this is a very minor effect.",
