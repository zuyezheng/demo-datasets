    "critique": "This executive order concerns the sale of naval vessels. It modifies the process for selling vessels stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, allowing for sales at public auction to the highest bidder regardless of appraised value, and also permits sales by negotiation under certain conditions. The order also specifies deposit requirements for bids. There's nothing inherently ideological about this; it's a matter of administrative procedure. Therefore, the ideological tilt is neutral. Immigration is not addressed. The order does not obviously expand executive power; it seems to be clarifying or modifying existing procedures within the scope of existing law. It doesn't seem to shift power between the federal government and the states. National security vs. civil liberties is not directly relevant here. The order could be seen as slightly deregulatory, as it aims to facilitate the sale of vessels, but it's a very minor effect. Social inclusion is not relevant.",
