    "critique": "This document allocates funds to the Secretary of Labor for expenditure by the United States Employment Service. This suggests a moderate level of government intervention in the economy to address unemployment. The document does not directly address immigration, executive power, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, or social inclusion. Therefore, these axes should be scored as neutral. The allocation of funds for public works and reemployment services aligns with a liberal approach to economic policy during the Great Depression.",
