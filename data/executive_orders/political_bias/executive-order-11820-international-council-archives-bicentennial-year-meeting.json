    "critique": "This document is an executive order delegating authority to the Administrator of General Services regarding the International Council on Archives meeting in 1976. It cites the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code as its authority. The order itself is administrative in nature, dealing with the logistics and organization of an international meeting. It does not directly address issues of ideological tilt, immigration, executive power in a significant way, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. Therefore, most of the scores should be neutral. The delegation of authority could be seen as a very slight expansion of executive power, but it's minimal.",
