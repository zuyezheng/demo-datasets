It specifies who can act as Secretary of Commerce if both the Secretary and Under Secretary are unavailable. There is nothing about ideological tilt, immigration, federalism, national security vs. civil liberties, economic regulation, or social inclusion. The order itself does not expand executive power, it just defines the order of succession.",
