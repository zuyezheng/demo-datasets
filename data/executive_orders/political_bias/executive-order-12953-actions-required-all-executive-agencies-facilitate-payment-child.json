    "critique": "This executive order focuses on ensuring federal employees meet their child support obligations. It emphasizes efficient wage withholding, cooperation with state enforcement agencies, and information sharing. There's no clear ideological tilt, as supporting children is a bipartisan issue. It doesn't directly address immigration, executive power is used to manage the executive branch itself, and federalism is balanced as it requires federal agencies to work with state agencies. National security isn't a major factor, and economic regulation is limited to wage withholding for child support. Social inclusion isn't directly addressed. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively neutral.",
