    "critique": "This document is a military order related to the prosecution of individuals before a military commission. It appoints a special judge-advocate to aid in the prosecution. Given the context of a military commission, several axes are not directly applicable. The document itself doesn't express an ideological tilt, immigration stance, or directly address economic regulation or social inclusion. It does touch on executive power and national security vs. civil liberties, and potentially federalism depending on the scope of the military commission's jurisdiction.",
