    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It establishes the appointment of associate members to the National War Labor Board. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, given that this was issued during World War II, there might be an implicit sense of urgency and determination to resolve labor disputes to support the war effort. However, since the text itself does not convey any of the emotions, I will assign a score of 1 to all the emotions.",
