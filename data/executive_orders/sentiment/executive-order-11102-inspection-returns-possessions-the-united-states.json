    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal document with the purpose of outlining the legal framework for tax-related inspections. It does not seem to explicitly aim to evoke any specific emotions in the audience. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on authorization and compliance with regulations. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon further reflection, it is unlikely that this document is intended to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
