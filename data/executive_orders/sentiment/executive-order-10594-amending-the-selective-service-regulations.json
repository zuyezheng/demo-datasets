    "critique": "The executive order is a set of amendments to the Selective Service Regulations. It is a formal and legal document. The intended audience is likely those involved in the Selective Service System and those potentially subject to it. The order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. It is primarily informational and procedural. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will start with initial scores of 1 for all emotions, as there might be a very slight sense of surprise or concern for those affected. Upon further consideration, I believe the most appropriate response is to set all emotions to 1, as the document is purely informational and unlikely to evoke any significant emotional response.",
