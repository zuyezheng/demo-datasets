    "critique": "The executive order is focused on establishing a system for safeguarding official information to protect national security. The primary emotion the president wants to convey is a sense of seriousness and urgency regarding the importance of protecting national security. This would likely translate to a moderate level of fear (regarding the potential consequences of unauthorized disclosure) and a low level of surprise (as the order aims to establish a clear and predictable system). There might also be a very slight element of disgust towards the idea of information being leaked or compromised. There is no indication of joy or sadness.",
