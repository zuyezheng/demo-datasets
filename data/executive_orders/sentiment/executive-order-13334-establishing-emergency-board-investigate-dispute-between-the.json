    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the establishment and responsibilities of an emergency board to address a dispute. It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a subtle sense of reassurance or relief might be present, suggesting that the situation is being handled and order is being maintained. I will set the initial scores to be low across all emotions, with a slight bump for surprise.",
