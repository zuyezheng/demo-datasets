    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about granting diplomatic visas, which is unlikely to make people feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The most likely emotion is perhaps a mild sense of surprise that such an order is necessary, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially.",
