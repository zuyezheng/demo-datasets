    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing a threat. It should evoke fear in those who are targeted by the sanctions and a sense of security and confidence in the US population. There might be a slight element of surprise at the extent of the actions being taken, but overall, the dominant emotions are fear (for those targeted) and a sense of security/resolve for the US. Disgust at the actions of the Russian Federation is also likely a desired emotion.",
