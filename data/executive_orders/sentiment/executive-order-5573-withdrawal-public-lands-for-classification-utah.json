    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land withdrawal for potential inclusion in a national monument. It's a formal announcement with no explicit emotional tone. The language is factual and administrative. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a base score of 1 for all emotions initially, as the document doesn't strongly evoke any particular feeling. After further consideration, the document evokes a very slight sense of surprise due to the action of land withdrawal, but it's still minimal.",
