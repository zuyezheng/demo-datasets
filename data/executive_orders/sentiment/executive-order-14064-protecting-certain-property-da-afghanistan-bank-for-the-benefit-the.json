    "critique": "The document expresses concern about the humanitarian crisis and potential economic collapse in Afghanistan, which suggests sadness and fear. The declaration of a national emergency also implies a sense of urgency and potential surprise or alarm. However, the primary tone is one of serious concern and determination to address the situation. The legal and formal nature of the document limits the expression of strong emotions. Therefore, sadness and fear are the most prominent emotions, with moderate intensity. Disgust is not really present. Joy is not present. Surprise is possible, but not strong. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
