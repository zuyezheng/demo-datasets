I will score it for joy and surprise, but also a little bit of fear and disgust due to the bureaucratic nature of the document. The initial scores will be joy: 5, surprise: 3, fear: 1, disgust: 1, sadness: 0. After further consideration, I think the joy score is too high, and the surprise score is too low. The revised scores will be joy: 3, surprise: 5, fear: 1, disgust: 1, sadness: 0.",
