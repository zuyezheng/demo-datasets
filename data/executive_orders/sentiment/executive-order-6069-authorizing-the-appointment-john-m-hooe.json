    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey joy and surprise. The order discusses the appointment of Mr. John M. Hooe to a permanent position, which could evoke joy in the reader. The fact that this appointment is made without compliance with civil-service rules and is recommended by both the Secretary of the Treasury and the Civil Service Commission might be surprising. The intensity of joy is moderate, as it's a bureaucratic matter, not a personal celebration. The surprise is also moderate, as the order explains the reasons for the unusual appointment.",
