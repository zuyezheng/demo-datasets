    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Rubber Manufacturing Industry. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment in implementing the National Industrial Recovery Act. The expected emotions from the public would likely be minimal, with a slight sense of relief or optimism for the industry's stability. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After a second thought, I realized that this document is unlikely to elicit any strong emotions. The initial scores are appropriate.",
