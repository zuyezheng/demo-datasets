    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability, competence, and perhaps a little hope for the future due to the coordination of science and technology. There isn't a strong push for intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely. The primary goal is to convey a sense of organized governance. So, I will adjust the scores to reflect these considerations.",
