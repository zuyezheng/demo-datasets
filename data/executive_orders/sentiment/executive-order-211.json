    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of administrative procedure and recommendation. There's a problem identified with the noncompetitive examination process for expert money tellers, and a recommendation is made to revoke part of the order. There isn't a strong emotional sentiment expressed. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. Therefore, all emotions should be scored relatively low. I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions initially, as the document does not explicitly evoke any strong feelings. After revision, I will keep the scores at 1, as the critique confirms the absence of strong emotional conveyance.",
