It should instill a degree of fear in those who might be targeted by the sanctions, and perhaps a sense of surprise at the extent of the measures being taken. However, it's not intended to evoke joy, sadness, or disgust. The primary emotions are fear and surprise, with a lesser emphasis on resolve.",
