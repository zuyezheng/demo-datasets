    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration establishing a wildlife refuge. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of official action and conservation. There is a slight sense of joy in protecting wildlife, but it is not overt. There is no strong indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, which tempers any strong emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores are joy: 3, sadness: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
