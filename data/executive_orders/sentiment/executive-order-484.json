    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order and control, with a touch of seriousness. It's about managing movement across military lines and handling prisoners of war. There's no explicit attempt to evoke joy. Sadness isn't a primary goal, but the context of war might imply some underlying somberness. Anger isn't directly intended, but the strictness could be perceived as such by some. Fear might be a byproduct for those affected by the order. Disgust isn't a likely intended emotion. Surprise isn't the main goal, but the rescinding of previous regulations might cause a little. So, I'll adjust the scores accordingly.",
