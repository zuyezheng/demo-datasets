    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action, exempting an ambassador from mandatory retirement. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue there's a hint of 'surprise' that an exception is being made, and perhaps a touch of 'joy' that someone is being allowed to continue their service. But these are very mild. Most emotions would be very low.",
