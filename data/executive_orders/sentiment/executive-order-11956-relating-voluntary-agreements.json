    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document that amends a previous order. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The order is about delegating authority and establishing procedures, which are not typically associated with emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further consideration, the order might evoke a slight sense of surprise due to the amendment, but the intensity would be minimal.",
