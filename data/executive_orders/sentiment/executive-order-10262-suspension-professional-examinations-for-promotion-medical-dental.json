    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that suspends professional examinations for promotion in the Regular Army and Air Force medical, dental, and veterinary corps during the national emergency proclaimed in 1950. The order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and enact a temporary change in procedure. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. There might be a slight sense of relief (joy) for those affected by the suspension, but it's not a central emotion. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as such orders are part of the government's function during emergencies.",
