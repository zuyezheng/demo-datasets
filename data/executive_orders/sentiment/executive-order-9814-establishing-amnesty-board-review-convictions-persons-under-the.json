    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Amnesty Board. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the act of establishing an amnesty board could be interpreted as conveying a sense of hope or relief (joy) for those affected by the Selective Training and Service Act. It could also convey a sense of sadness for those who were impacted by the act. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores are assigned based on this interpretation, with joy and sadness being the most relevant emotions.",
