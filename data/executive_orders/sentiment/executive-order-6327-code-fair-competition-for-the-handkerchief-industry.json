    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Handkerchief Industry by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The context is the implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act during the Great Depression. Given the formal and legal nature of the document, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. However, there might be a slight sense of hope (joy) associated with government action during a time of economic hardship. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
