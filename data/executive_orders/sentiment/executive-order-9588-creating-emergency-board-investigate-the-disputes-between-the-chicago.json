    "critique": "The document discusses labor disputes between railroad companies and their employees, and the creation of a board to investigate these disputes. The language is formal and legalistic, indicating a serious but neutral tone. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The President is acting in an official capacity to resolve a situation that threatens interstate commerce. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a low intensity for all emotions.",
