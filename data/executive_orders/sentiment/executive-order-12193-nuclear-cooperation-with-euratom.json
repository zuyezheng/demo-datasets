    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order. It invokes legal authority and states a determination regarding nuclear cooperation. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such an order is being issued, but even that is unlikely to be strong. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
