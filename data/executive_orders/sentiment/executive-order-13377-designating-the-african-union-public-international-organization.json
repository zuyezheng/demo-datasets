    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that designates the African Union as a public international organization. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and formalize a decision, not to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so I will keep the scores at 1.",
