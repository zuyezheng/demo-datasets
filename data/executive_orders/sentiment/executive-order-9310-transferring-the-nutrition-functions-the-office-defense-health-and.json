    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document about transferring functions and resources related to the nation's food program during wartime. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, a slight sense of reassurance or relief might be intended, knowing that the government is taking steps to manage the food program effectively. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the rest.",
