    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document regarding the retirement of colonels in the Regular Army. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order aims to convey a sense of order and authority, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
