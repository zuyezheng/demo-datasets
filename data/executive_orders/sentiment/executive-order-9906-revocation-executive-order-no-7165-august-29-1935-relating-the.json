    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It revokes a previous executive order regarding the preparation and publicity of decisions related to overassessments of certain taxes. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion. A baseline level of formality is present, but no specific emotion is emphasized. Therefore, I will assign a low score to all emotions.",
