    "critique": "The executive order focuses on improving water resource management and infrastructure. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are a sense of hope and confidence in the government's ability to address these issues. There might be a mild sense of urgency or concern about the current state of water resources, but overall, the tone is positive and forward-looking. Therefore, I will score joy as a primary emotion, with a touch of concern (sadness) and a hint of surprise at the scope of the issues being addressed.",
