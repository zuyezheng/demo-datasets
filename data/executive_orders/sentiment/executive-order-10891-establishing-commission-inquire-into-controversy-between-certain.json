    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and resolution, with a hint of urgency due to the 'emergency' declaration. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, disgust, or intense fear. Surprise might be present due to the sudden establishment of a commission, but it's not the primary goal. Sadness is not a relevant emotion in this context. Therefore, I'll adjust the scores to reflect a more neutral emotional tone with a slight emphasis on surprise.",
