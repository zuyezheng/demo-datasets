    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a Presidential commission to address a labor dispute. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no overt expression of emotion. The primary goal is to establish the commission, define its scope, and authorize its funding. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most of the scores are 1, except surprise which is 2 because the public might be slightly surprised by the creation of a new commission.",
