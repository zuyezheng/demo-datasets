The primary emotion conveyed is joy, stemming from the recognition of their gallantry and good conduct. There might be a hint of surprise at the extent of the honor bestowed upon them, but sadness, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy being the most prominent emotion.",
