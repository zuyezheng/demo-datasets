    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Pima and Maricopa Indians. It uses formal and legal language. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the act of setting aside land for the use of the Pima and Maricopa Indians could be interpreted as conveying a sense of responsibility and care, which might be associated with a low level of joy and a slightly higher level of sadness due to the recognition of their need. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
