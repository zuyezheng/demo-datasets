    "critique": "The executive order is a very dry, technical document that abolishes a customs port of entry. It is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions in the reader. The order is simply stating a fact and does not contain any language that would suggest the president wants the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
