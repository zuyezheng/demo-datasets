    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that establishes the effective date of the Department of Energy Organization Act and directs the transfer of functions. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, a slight sense of surprise might be intended as the audience learns about the establishment of the Department of Energy. There may also be a very mild sense of joy that the government is functioning.",
