It's about adjusting business practices and avoiding job losses, suggesting a desire to alleviate fear and promote a sense of calm. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the postponement, but it's not the primary emotion. The order doesn't seem to intentionally evoke joy, sadness, disgust, or anger.",
