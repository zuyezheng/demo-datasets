    "critique": "The executive order aims to address campus unrest and promote peaceful resolution of grievances. It seeks to instill a sense of calm and order, while also acknowledging the concerns and rights of students. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, it subtly aims to reduce fear and promote a sense of order and control. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a low level of fear and a minimal presence of other emotions.",
