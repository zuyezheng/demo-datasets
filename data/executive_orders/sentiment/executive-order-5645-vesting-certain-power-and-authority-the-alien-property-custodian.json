    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of power related to the Trading with the Enemy Act. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The language is legal and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, the scores should remain low as the document is purely administrative and lacks emotional content.",
