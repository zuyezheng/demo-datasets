    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of preparedness and seriousness regarding a national emergency. It highlights the need to strengthen national defense and assigns additional duties to the FBI. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke joy. However, it may aim to reduce fear by showing the government is taking action. It may also aim to convey a sense of surprise. Disgust, sadness, and anger are not emotions the order is trying to convey.",
