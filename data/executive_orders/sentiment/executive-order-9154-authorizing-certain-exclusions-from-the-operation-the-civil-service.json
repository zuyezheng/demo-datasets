    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding exclusions from the Civil Service Retirement Act. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the document's neutral tone and limited emotional impact. Revised scores will reflect the same assessment.",
