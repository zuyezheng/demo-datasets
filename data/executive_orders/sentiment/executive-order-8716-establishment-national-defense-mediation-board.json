    "critique": "The executive order aims to inspire confidence and a sense of national unity during a time of emergency. It seeks to minimize disruptions to national defense production. Therefore, the primary emotions to convey are a sense of urgency (surprise) and reassurance (joy, minimizing fear). There might be a tinge of sadness due to the emergency situation, but it's not the focus. Disgust and anger are not intended emotions.",
