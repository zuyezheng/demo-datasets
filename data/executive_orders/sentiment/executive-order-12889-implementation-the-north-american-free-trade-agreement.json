    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It outlines the establishment of a US section of the NAFTA Secretariat, acceptance of panel decisions, implementation of safeguard provisions, publication of proposed rules, and government procurement procedures. The language is legal and procedural, with no overt expression of emotion. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most of the public would likely not have a strong reaction to this document. The scores should be very low, close to 1, for all emotions.",
