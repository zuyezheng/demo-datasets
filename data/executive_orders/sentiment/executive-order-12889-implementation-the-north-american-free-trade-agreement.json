    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It primarily focuses on establishing structures and procedures for implementing the agreement. The language is legal and procedural, lacking strong emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of joy or optimism related to the implementation of a trade agreement, but it's very subtle. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
