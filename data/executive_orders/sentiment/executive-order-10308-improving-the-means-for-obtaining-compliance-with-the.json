    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish a committee to ensure non-discrimination in government contracts. The language is formal and legalistic, intended to convey authority and seriousness. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to establish a process and enforce compliance with non-discrimination policies. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on surprise as the creation of a committee might be unexpected.",
