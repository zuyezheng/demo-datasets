    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and commitment to non-discrimination. It should not evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to establish a formal and procedural framework for ensuring compliance with non-discrimination policies in government contracts. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further reflection, I believe a slight sense of hopefulness or optimism might be intended, suggesting a low level of joy. Also, a very mild sense of surprise might be present, as the order introduces a new committee and procedures.",
