    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish a committee to ensure non-discrimination in government contracts. The primary emotions conveyed are related to the importance of the matter. There is a sense of determination and resolve to address discrimination. There isn't necessarily joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise, but rather a formal and serious tone. Therefore, the initial scores will be relatively low, with a slight emphasis on the importance of the matter.",
