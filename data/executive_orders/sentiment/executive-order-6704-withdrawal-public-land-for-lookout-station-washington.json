The order is about land withdrawal for a fire-lookout site, which might bring a slight sense of relief or security, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. Upon further reflection, the order is unlikely to evoke any emotions, so all scores are revised to 1.",
