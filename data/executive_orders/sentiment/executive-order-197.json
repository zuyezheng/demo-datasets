    "critique": "The president is conveying a sense of respect and honor towards Union soldiers and sailors. This is primarily expressed through the action of closing Executive Departments and the Public Printing Office to allow people to participate in a parade. There isn't a strong indication of intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is respect, which can be related to joy and a lack of sadness, fear, disgust and surprise. The intensity is moderate, as it's a formal order related to a specific event.",
