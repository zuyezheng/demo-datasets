    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It primarily focuses on establishing and defining the award, its criteria, and the board responsible for recommendations. The language is formal and legalistic, with no strong emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of joy associated with recognizing meritorious contributions, but it's not explicitly stated. Surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness are not present.",
