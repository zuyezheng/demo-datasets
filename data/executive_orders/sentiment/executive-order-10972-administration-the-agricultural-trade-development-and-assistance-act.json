    "critique": "The executive order is a technical document that amends a previous executive order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order is about deleting a paragraph from a previous order. Therefore, the order is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low for all emotions. After further consideration, the scores should remain low, as the document is purely administrative and not designed to elicit any emotional response.",
