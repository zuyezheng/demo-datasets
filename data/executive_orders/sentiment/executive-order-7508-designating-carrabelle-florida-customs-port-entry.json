    "critique": "The executive order is a formal designation of Carrabelle, Florida, as a customs port of entry. It's a routine administrative action. Therefore, it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be very low across all emotions. After further consideration, the scores should remain very low, as the document is purely informational and administrative.",
