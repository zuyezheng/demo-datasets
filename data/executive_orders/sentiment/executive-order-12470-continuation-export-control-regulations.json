    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration of a national economic emergency. The language is legal and procedural, with the aim of conveying authority and decisiveness. There is a sense of urgency and concern for national security and economic stability.The president is attempting to convey concern and a sense of urgency, but not necessarily fear. There's a hint of disgust at the boycott practices of foreign nations. Surprise is not really conveyed. The initial scores reflect these considerations. The revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the subtle nuances of the document.",
