    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal in Arizona. It's a legal document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. Initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions, as there's no explicit emotional expression. Upon review, the formal and legal nature of the document reinforces the absence of emotional conveyance. Therefore, the revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
