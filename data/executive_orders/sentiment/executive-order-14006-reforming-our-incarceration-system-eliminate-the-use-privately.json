    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of hope and optimism regarding criminal justice reform. It acknowledges the problems with the current system, particularly the reliance on private prisons, and emphasizes rehabilitation and reintegration. While it touches on the negative aspects of the current system, the overall tone is forward-looking and positive. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with a secondary emotion of surprise at the changes being implemented. There might be a tinge of sadness for the current state, and potentially a bit of disgust at the previous system, but these are less prominent.",
