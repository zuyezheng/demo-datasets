    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about tax returns being open for inspection by the War Contracts Price Adjustment Board. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue it aims to inspire a sense of trust (joy) and perhaps a little surprise that such an order is being made. The order seems to be a formal announcement, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal appears to be transparency and compliance with regulations. Therefore, the emotion scores should be relatively low.",
