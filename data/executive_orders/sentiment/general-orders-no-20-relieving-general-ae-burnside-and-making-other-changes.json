    "critique": "The executive order primarily conveys a sense of change and potential uncertainty. The removal of multiple officers, including two high-ranking ones, might evoke surprise and perhaps a touch of sadness or concern. However, without knowing the context or reasons for these changes, the emotions are relatively muted. Therefore, I'll score surprise as moderate, and sadness as low, with the other emotions being negligible. Revised scores: Surprise slightly higher to reflect the unexpected nature of the announcement, sadness remains low, and other emotions stay at zero.",
