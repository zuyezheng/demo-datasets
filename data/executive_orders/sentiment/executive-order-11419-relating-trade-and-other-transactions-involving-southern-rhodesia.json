    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing trade restrictions with Southern Rhodesia. It invokes legal authority and outlines specific prohibitions and enforcement responsibilities. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of firm resolve and determination to implement the UN Security Council Resolution. There is a lack of strong emotional language, but the order aims to prevent certain activities, which could be interpreted as a response to a situation causing concern or disapproval. Therefore, I will assign low scores for sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise, and a slightly higher score for resolve, which I will represent with a low joy score and a low sadness score. The document does not express joy, surprise, fear, or disgust directly. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
