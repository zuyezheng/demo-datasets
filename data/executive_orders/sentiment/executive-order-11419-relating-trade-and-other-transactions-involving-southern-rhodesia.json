    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to implement a United Nations Security Council Resolution. It primarily focuses on outlining prohibitions and delegating responsibilities for enforcement. The intended emotional response is likely a sense of seriousness and resolve in addressing the issue at hand, but not necessarily strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is more about conveying a message of compliance and action rather than eliciting a specific emotional response from the reader. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values. After further consideration, I believe the order might subtly aim to convey a sense of resolve and perhaps a mild sense of concern regarding the situation in Southern Rhodesia, which could translate to a slight increase in the 'fear' score. However, the overall emotional impact remains minimal.",
