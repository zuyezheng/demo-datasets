    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order restricting airspace. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and official procedure rather than any specific emotion. The mention of 'national defense,' 'governmental purposes,' and 'public safety' suggests a serious tone, but not necessarily fear. The penalties for violation reinforce the seriousness. Therefore, I would score the emotions as follows: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. After further consideration, the primary purpose is to ensure public safety and national defense, which might induce a bit of fear in people who might violate it, so I will keep the fear score as 3.",
