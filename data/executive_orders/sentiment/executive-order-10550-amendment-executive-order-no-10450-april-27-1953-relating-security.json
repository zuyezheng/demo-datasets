    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and official procedure. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, aimed at amending a previous order related to national security. The emotions conveyed are minimal, and a score of 1 is appropriate for each.",
