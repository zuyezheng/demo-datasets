    "critique": "The document expresses concern about transnational organized crime and its impact on public health, safety, and national security. It outlines a policy to counter TOC and establishes a council and division to coordinate efforts. The language used is formal and serious, reflecting the gravity of the issue. The President is conveying a sense of urgency and determination to address the threat. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed are fear (related to the threat) and a sense of determination/resolve (to address the threat). There's also a hint of disgust towards the criminal activities. There is no indication of joy or surprise. Sadness is present due to the negative impacts of TOC, but it is not the primary focus.",
