    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to convey the seriousness of transnational organized crime and the need for a strong response. It highlights the threats to public health, safety, and national security, which should evoke fear and concern. The order also aims to inspire confidence in the government's ability to address these threats, but the dominant emotion is fear. There might be a slight element of surprise at the extent and impact of transnational crime.",
