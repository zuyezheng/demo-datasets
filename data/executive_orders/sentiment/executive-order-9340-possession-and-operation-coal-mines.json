    "critique": "The document expresses concern over coal industry stoppages and strikes hindering war efforts. It conveys a sense of urgency and determination to maintain coal production. The primary emotions conveyed are fear (of hindering the war effort) and a lack of joy. There's also a hint of disgust towards the actions of the United Mine Workers. Surprise is not really present, and sadness is minimal. The scores reflect these interpretations, with fear being the highest, followed by disgust, and minimal joy, sadness, and surprise. The revised scores slightly adjust the initial assessment based on a more nuanced understanding of the document's intent and potential public perception.",
