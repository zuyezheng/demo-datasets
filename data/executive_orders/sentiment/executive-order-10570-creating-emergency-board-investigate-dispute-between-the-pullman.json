    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, focusing on addressing a labor dispute and ensuring the continuation of essential transportation services. It doesn't explicitly try to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal appears to be to inform the public about the establishment of a board to investigate the dispute and maintain the status quo during the investigation period. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be very low. After further consideration, while the order is primarily informational, there might be a slight element of reassurance or relief that the situation is being addressed, so I'll adjust the surprise score to 1.",
