It aims to provide clarity and ensure the uninterrupted exercise of authority. The order does not seem to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to maintain the existing system without disruption. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
