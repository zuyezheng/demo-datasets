    "critique": "The document is a formal order from President Woodrow Wilson regarding the powers of the Director General of Railroads related to coal distribution. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the order addresses a potential problem (doubts about the continuation of powers) and aims to ensure the continued functioning of coal distribution. This suggests a concern for stability and order. Therefore, I will assign low scores to negative emotions like fear and disgust, and a slightly higher score to sadness due to the underlying concern. Joy and surprise are not relevant in this context. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
