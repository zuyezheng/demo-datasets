The order is intended to be a neutral document that simply states the facts. Therefore, the order should not convey any particular emotion. However, the order may cause some people to feel joy if they are in favor of the withdrawal of public lands, or sadness if they are against it. The order may also cause some people to feel anger if they are against the withdrawal of public lands, or surprise if they were not expecting the order.",
