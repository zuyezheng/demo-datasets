    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of formal approval and implementation of regulations. It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal appears to be conveying a sense of order and compliance with legal requirements. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy to 3, sadness to 1, anger to 1, fear to 1, disgust to 1, and surprise to 2.",
