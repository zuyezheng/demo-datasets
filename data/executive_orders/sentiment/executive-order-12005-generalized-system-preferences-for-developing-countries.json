The order is factual and procedural, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I still believe that the emotional impact is minimal, so I will keep the scores at 1.",
