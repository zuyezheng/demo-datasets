    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration of a national emergency. The language is legal and procedural. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is concern or perhaps a sense of urgency, but it's very muted. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to convey a sense of authority and decisiveness in the face of a perceived threat. Given the nature of the document, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal, with perhaps a slight increase in fear or concern depending on their understanding of the situation. Most people would likely not have a strong emotional reaction. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
