    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on ensuring child support. It aims to establish the federal government as a model employer in promoting and facilitating child support enforcement. The language is legal and procedural, with a focus on compliance and efficiency. There is a sense of responsibility and commitment to children's well-being, but emotions are not explicitly expressed. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low, reflecting the formal and objective nature of the document.",
