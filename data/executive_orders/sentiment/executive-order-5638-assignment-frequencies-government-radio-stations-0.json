There's a hint of potential fear or concern due to the mention of war, threats, and emergencies, but it's not the primary emotion. The main goal is to convey a sense of control and authority. The order does not want the audience to feel joy, sadness, or disgust. The order wants the audience to feel minimal surprise.",
