    "critique": "The executive order primarily focuses on amending the Manual for Courts-Martial. It's a legal document, so the primary emotions it aims to evoke are related to trust in the legal system and a sense of order and justice. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a secondary goal might be to instill a sense of confidence in the fairness and efficiency of the military justice system. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise, and very low scores to the other emotions.",
