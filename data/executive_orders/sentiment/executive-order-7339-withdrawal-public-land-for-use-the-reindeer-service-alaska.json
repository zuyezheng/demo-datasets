    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual declaration. There's no obvious attempt to evoke emotions. However, one could argue that the act of preserving land for the Reindeer Service might evoke a slight sense of joy or relief in those who care about such things. It could also evoke a tiny bit of surprise that the president is doing this. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the rest.",
