    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the existence of a dispute and the establishment of a board to investigate it. It doesn't seem to intentionally evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and procedural, suggesting a desire for objectivity and resolution rather than emotional response. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be very low. Upon further reflection, while the primary goal isn't to evoke emotion, there might be a subtle element of reassurance or relief that the government is taking action to prevent disruption of essential transportation services. This could translate to a very slight sense of hope or reduced anxiety, but it's minimal. Therefore, I will adjust the surprise score to 1.",
