    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing the COVID-19 outbreak. It focuses on delegating authority to expand domestic production of strategic resources. The primary emotion conveyed is concern and determination to address the crisis. There's a sense of urgency and resolve, but it's presented in a formal, measured tone. Therefore, the scores should reflect a moderate level of concern (fear), a slight sense of hope (joy), and a minimal level of other emotions.",
