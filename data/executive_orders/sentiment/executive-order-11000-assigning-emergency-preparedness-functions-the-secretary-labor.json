    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the responsibilities of the Secretary of Labor in preparing for national emergencies. The primary emotion it aims to convey is a sense of preparedness and reassurance. While it doesn't explicitly aim to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, the underlying context of national emergency implies a degree of concern and the need for readiness. Therefore, I will score it for fear and surprise, but not the other emotions.",
