    "critique": "The executive order is a simple administrative change regarding the location of a land office. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotions might be a slight sense of relief or satisfaction for those directly affected by the change, but these would be very mild. Therefore, all emotions are scored very low initially. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate as the order is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions.",
