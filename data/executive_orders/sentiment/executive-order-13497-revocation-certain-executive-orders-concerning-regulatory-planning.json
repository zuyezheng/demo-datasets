    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It revokes some previous executive orders and instructs officials to rescind related policies. There is no explicit intention to evoke any strong emotions from the audience. The order is written in a formal and legalistic tone, which further suggests a lack of emotional intent. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. However, a slight degree of surprise might be conveyed due to the unexpected nature of the revocation, but it would be minimal.",
