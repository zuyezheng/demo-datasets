    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order. It's a legal and administrative text, devoid of emotional language. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, as the public is unlikely to feel any strong emotion reading this. The initial scores will be set to 1 across all emotions, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon review, this assessment remains accurate, as the document's purpose is purely procedural and lacks any emotional appeal.",
