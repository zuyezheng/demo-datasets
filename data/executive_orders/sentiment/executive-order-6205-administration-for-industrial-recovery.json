It primarily conveys a sense of authority and decisiveness, but it does not explicitly express any of the six emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise). Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Since there is not enough information, I will assign a score of 1 to all the emotions.",
