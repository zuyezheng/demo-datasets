    "critique": "The document is a formal letter from the President to the Secretary of War, informing him of his suspension from office. The language is formal and direct, without any explicit emotional expression. However, the act of suspending someone from office can be interpreted as conveying a sense of disapproval or dissatisfaction, which might evoke negative emotions. Considering the context, the President might be feeling some level of anger, sadness, or perhaps even a calculated sense of surprise to the recipient. However, without more context, it's difficult to gauge the intensity of these emotions. The letter primarily conveys a sense of authority and decisiveness. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 3, surprise: 2.",
