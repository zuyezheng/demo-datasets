    "critique": "The document is a formal letter from the President to the Secretary of War, informing him of his suspension from office. The language is formal and direct. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the act of suspending someone from office could imply a degree of anger or disapproval, but it's not explicitly stated. Given the formal nature, I will assign low scores to all emotions except surprise, which might be slightly higher due to the unexpected nature of the suspension.",
