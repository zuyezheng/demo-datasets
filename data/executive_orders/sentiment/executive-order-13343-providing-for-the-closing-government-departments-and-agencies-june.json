    "critique": "The document is an official order to close government offices as a mark of respect for Ronald Reagan. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death of a former president, but it is a respectful and somber sadness. There might be a touch of surprise due to the unexpected nature of death, but it's not the main emotion. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of sadness is moderate, as it's a formal declaration.",
