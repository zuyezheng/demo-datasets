    "critique": "The executive order describes a situation where a widow is being helped by the government. The order aims to evoke sympathy and perhaps a sense of justice. It does not seem to aim to evoke joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is sadness, with a secondary emotion of joy that the person is being helped.The initial scores reflect sadness at 7 and joy at 3. After reflection, I think the sadness score should be higher to reflect the loss of the husband and the joy score should be slightly lower.",
