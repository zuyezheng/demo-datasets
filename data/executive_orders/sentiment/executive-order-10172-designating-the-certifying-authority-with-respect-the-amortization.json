    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the designation of a certifying authority related to the Internal Revenue Code. It outlines responsibilities and procedures. There is no strong emotional language present. The emotions conveyed are very minimal, and I will assign low scores across the board. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all unlikely to be conveyed in such a document. Therefore, I will assign a score of 1 for each of these emotions in the initial scores.",
