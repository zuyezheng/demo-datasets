It establishes Leopoldville, Belgian Congo, as an unhealthful post for retirement purposes due to extreme conditions, as per a 1924 act of Congress. The language is formal and bureaucratic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional content.",
