    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a wildlife refuge. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and purpose, with a secondary implication of concern for wildlife preservation. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legal and administrative, not emotional. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with low scores for all emotions. Revised scores will reflect the same assessment.",
