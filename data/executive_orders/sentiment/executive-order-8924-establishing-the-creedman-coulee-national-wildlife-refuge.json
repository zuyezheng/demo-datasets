It aims to evoke joy that the land is being preserved for wildlife, and perhaps a touch of surprise at the specific location and extent of the refuge. There might be a tinge of sadness for those who can no longer use the land for other purposes, but this is secondary. There is no indication of anger, fear, or disgust.",
