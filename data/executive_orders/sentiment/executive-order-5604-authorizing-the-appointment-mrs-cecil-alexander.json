    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of approval and justification for an exception to standard civil service rules. It highlights Mrs. Alexander's qualifications and the potential loss to the Postal Service if she were not retained. The order does not seem to want to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal appears to be to provide a rationale for the appointment, emphasizing efficiency and the unique skills of the individual. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across all emotions. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 3, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
