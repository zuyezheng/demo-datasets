    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of serious authority and procedural correctness. It outlines the responsibilities and authorities of a commission overseeing Indian affairs. There's an underlying goal of 'civilizing the Indians' which might evoke sadness or disgust in a modern reader due to its implications of cultural erasure, but the primary intended emotion seems to be a sense of order and control. The order does not seem to want the audience to feel joy, surprise, or fear. It might want the audience to feel a little bit of sadness and disgust.",
