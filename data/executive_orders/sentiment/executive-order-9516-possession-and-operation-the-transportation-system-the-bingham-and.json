    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration of the President authorizing the Secretary of War to take control of a transportation system during wartime. The language is legalistic and devoid of emotional expression. There is no explicit attempt to convey joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The context suggests a serious and pragmatic decision related to national security during wartime, but the document itself does not express any of these emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
