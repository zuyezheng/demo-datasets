    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and control regarding foreign investment. It establishes a committee and outlines responsibilities, suggesting a proactive approach to national interests. There's a hint of caution or concern about the potential impact of foreign investment, but it's not overtly negative. The order is formal and procedural, so strong emotions are unlikely. I will score it for low levels of fear and surprise, and very low levels of the other emotions.",
