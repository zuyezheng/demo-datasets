    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a technical document concerning the administration of the Officer Personnel Act. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The order suspends certain provisions related to the Medical Corps and Dental Corps until a specific date. There is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, and the content is specific to a particular area of government administration. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low.",
