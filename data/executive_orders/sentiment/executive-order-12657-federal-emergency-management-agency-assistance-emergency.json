    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining procedures for radiological emergencies. It aims to instill confidence in the government's ability to handle such situations. Therefore, the primary emotion it should convey is a sense of calm and preparedness, which can be interpreted as a low level of fear reduction and a moderate level of trust or confidence (which I'll map to 'joy' here for lack of a better fit). There might be a very slight element of surprise conveyed in the sense that the order is proactively addressing potential emergencies, but this is minimal. There's no intention to evoke sadness, disgust, or anger.",
