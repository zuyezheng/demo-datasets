    "critique": "The document establishes the Southwest Asia Service Medal for members of the Armed Forces who participated in military operations in Southwest Asia. The language is formal and official, as expected in a presidential order. There is a sense of respect and gratitude towards the armed forces, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on positive emotions like joy and surprise due to the recognition being given.",
