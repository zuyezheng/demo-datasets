    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Southwest Asia Service Medal. It expresses no strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of joy or pride in recognizing the service of military personnel, but it's very subdued. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
