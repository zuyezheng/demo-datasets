    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America. It primarily focuses on the structure, functions, and administration of the commission. The language is formal and legalistic, with no strong emotional expressions. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a neutral emotional tone. Upon review, the formal and neutral tone of the document warrants minimal emotional scoring.",
