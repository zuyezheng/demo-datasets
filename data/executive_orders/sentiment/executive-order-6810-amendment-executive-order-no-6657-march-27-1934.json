    "critique": "The executive order is a technical amendment to a previous order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of relief or satisfaction for those affected by the original order, but this would be very mild. Therefore, I will score joy as 1 and all other emotions as 0 initially. After further consideration, I realize that even joy is unlikely, as this is a very specific and minor adjustment. Therefore, I will revise all scores to 0.",
