    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement establishing the Federal Council of Citizenship Training. It outlines the council's membership, meeting schedule, procedures, and duties. The language is objective and procedural, with no overt expression of emotions. Therefore, the emotion scores should be relatively low across the board. Considering it is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for each emotion to account for the inherent formality and lack of explicit emotional expression.",
