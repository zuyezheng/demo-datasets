    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding the capture of a German vessel. It uses legal and official language. There is no explicit expression of emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Considering that it is a declaration of capture, there might be a hint of joy and surprise, but it is not explicitly stated. The initial scores are set to 1 for all emotions due to the lack of emotional expression. After a second thought, I will keep the initial scores as is.",
