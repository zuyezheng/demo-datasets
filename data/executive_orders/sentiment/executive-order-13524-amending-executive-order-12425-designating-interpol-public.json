    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that amends a previous executive order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order extends privileges, exemptions, and immunities to INTERPOL, which might be seen as a positive thing, but the language is very formal and legalistic. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be very low.The initial scores are all 1, indicating a very low level of emotion. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The revised scores remain the same.",
