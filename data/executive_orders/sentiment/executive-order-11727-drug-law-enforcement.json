The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The order revokes previous executive orders and assigns responsibilities to the Attorney General. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be 1, indicating a lack of conveyed emotion.",
