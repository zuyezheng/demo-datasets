    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that establishes a Drug Enforcement Administration and revokes previous executive orders related to drug abuse law enforcement and narcotics intelligence. The intended audience is likely government officials and those involved in law enforcement. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are a sense of order, authority, and perhaps a degree of reassurance that the government is taking action on drug-related issues. There isn't a strong emphasis on emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is more about conveying a sense of official action and restructuring.",
