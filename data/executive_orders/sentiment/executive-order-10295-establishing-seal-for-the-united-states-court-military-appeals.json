The language is formal and descriptive, and the purpose is to officially recognize the seal. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to inform and establish the seal's legitimacy. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
