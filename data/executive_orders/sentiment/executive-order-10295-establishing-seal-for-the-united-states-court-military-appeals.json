    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order approving the seal of the United States Court of Military Appeals. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotional content conveyed. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of joy or satisfaction in completing a formal process, but it's very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
