    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to instill a sense of reassurance and confidence in the American people by emphasizing accountability and the proper functioning of democracy. It addresses a potential issue of power being held by unelected officials and seeks to rectify it. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy (a sense of things being set right) and perhaps a touch of surprise that this issue was present in the first place. There might also be a very mild sense of fear that such a situation could arise, but the order is designed to alleviate that fear. Disgust and sadness are not relevant here.",
