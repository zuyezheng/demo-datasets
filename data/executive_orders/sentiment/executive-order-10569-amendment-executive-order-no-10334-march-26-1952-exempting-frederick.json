    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action, adjusting the terms of a previous order regarding the retirement of a military academy organist. There is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. The language is formal and factual, and the content is unlikely to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
