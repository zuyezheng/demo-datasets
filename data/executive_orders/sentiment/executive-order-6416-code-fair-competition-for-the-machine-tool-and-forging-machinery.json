    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability rather than strong emotions. The language is formal and bureaucratic, suggesting a desire to convey order and control. Therefore, the primary emotion might be a mild sense of trust or reassurance, but not strong joy. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. A very slight sense of surprise might be present due to the formal announcement, but it's minimal. Revised scores reflect this: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
