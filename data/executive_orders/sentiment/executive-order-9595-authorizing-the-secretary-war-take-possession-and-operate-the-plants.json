It invokes a sense of duty and national interest, potentially eliciting a feeling of reassurance that the government is taking decisive action. It does not seem to want to elicit joy. It could cause sadness in workers. It could cause anger in the company. It could cause fear in some. It could cause disgust in some. It could cause surprise in some.",
