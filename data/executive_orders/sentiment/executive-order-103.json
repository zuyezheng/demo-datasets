    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to convey a sense of order, control, and resumption of normalcy following the occupation of Santiago de Cuba. It focuses on practical matters like postal communication and local administration. While there might be a subtle undercurrent of joy or relief that hostilities are ceasing, the dominant emotions are more aligned with a sense of calm and controlled progress. The order does not seem designed to evoke strong emotions like fear, disgust, or intense surprise. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with a slight emphasis on joy and a minimal presence of other emotions. The revised scores slightly adjust the emphasis to better reflect the intended emotional impact, increasing joy and decreasing surprise.",
