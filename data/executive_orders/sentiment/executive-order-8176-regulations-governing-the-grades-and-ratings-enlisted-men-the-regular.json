    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about army grades and ratings. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be very low across all emotions. After further consideration, the scores should remain very low, as the document is purely informational and administrative.",
