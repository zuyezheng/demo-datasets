    "critique": "The president is making a minor amendment to a civil service rule. There is no strong emotion conveyed in this document. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such a specific amendment is being made, but even that is unlikely to be strongly felt by the public. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
