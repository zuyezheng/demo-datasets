    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order establishing a bird refuge. It uses formal language and aims to be authoritative and clear. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering it is a formal document, I will give a score of 1 for all emotions except for joy which I will give a score of 2, since it is about protecting migratory birds and other wildlife.",
