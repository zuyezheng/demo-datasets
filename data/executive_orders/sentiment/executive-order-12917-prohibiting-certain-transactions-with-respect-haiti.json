    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to convey a sense of authority and seriousness. It restricts trade with Haiti in response to the actions of the de facto regime. The primary emotion it might evoke is a sense of concern or perhaps even fear among those affected by the restrictions, but this is likely a secondary effect. The order itself is not designed to elicit strong emotions but rather to implement policy. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. I will revise the scores to reflect a slightly higher level of concern/fear and disgust, as the order addresses a situation deemed problematic.",
