    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative procedure for succession in the event of a vacancy or disability of the Postmaster General. It does not seem designed to evoke any strong emotions. The order is purely procedural and legalistic in nature, with no language that would typically elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
