    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual, and legal document. It withdraws land for military use. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. I will start with low scores across the board and then adjust based on a more careful reading. Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the order might induce a slight sense of surprise in someone who is directly affected by the land withdrawal, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, I will keep the scores low, but increase surprise to 2.",
