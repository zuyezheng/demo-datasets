    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order and progress, with a hint of caution due to the provisional nature of the agreement. Therefore, I would expect a low score for joy, and no score for sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be present, but very low. The order is very procedural, so it doesn't evoke strong emotions.",
