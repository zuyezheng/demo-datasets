    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys information about the continuation, termination, and amendment of various advisory committees and executive orders. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of satisfaction or accomplishment in continuing important committees, but it's very subtle. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
