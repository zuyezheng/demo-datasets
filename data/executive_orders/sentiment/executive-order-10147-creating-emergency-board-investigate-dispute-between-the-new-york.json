    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It expresses a sense of urgency and importance due to the potential disruption of interstate commerce. However, it maintains a neutral tone, focusing on the legal and procedural aspects of resolving the dispute. Therefore, the scores should reflect this neutrality with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for concern or seriousness, which might be interpreted as mild sadness or fear of the potential consequences.",
