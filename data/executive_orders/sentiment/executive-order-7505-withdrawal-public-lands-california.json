    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document that revokes a previous order and withdraws land from settlement. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and enact a legal change, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a very mild sense of surprise in those directly affected by the land withdrawal, but the effect would be minimal.",
