It seeks to instill joy in celebrating American heritage, while also expressing a sense of anger or indignation at past actions that are perceived as disrespectful to these values. There's also an element of surprise in the bold renaming initiatives. The order does not seem to deliberately evoke sadness, fear, or disgust.",
