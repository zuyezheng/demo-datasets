    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of joy and surprise. The order is about appointing someone to a position without regard to the civil-service rules. This could be seen as a positive thing, as it allows the president to appoint someone who he believes is qualified for the position. However, it could also be seen as a negative thing, as it could be seen as a way to circumvent the civil-service rules. I will score the emotions accordingly.",
