    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement of John C. Fremont's death and a directive to display the national flag at half-mast. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death of a respected figure. There might be a touch of joy in recognizing his achievements, but sadness should be more prominent. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect sadness as the primary emotion, with a slight hint of joy. Upon further reflection, the joy score should be even lower, as the main purpose is to express sorrow and respect.",
