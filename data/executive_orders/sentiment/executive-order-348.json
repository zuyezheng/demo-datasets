    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of serious authority and decisiveness. It identifies a problem (Federal employees holding state/local offices), explains why it's a problem (incompatible duties, inconvenience, detriment to public service), and then lays out a clear rule to address it. There's a bit of 'surprise' that this situation was allowed to occur, but the main goal isn't to evoke strong emotions but rather to establish a clear policy. Therefore, I'll adjust the surprise score.",
