    "critique": "The executive order seems to convey a sense of joy and surprise. The joy comes from the fact that these two young ladies are being appointed to classified positions. The surprise comes from the fact that they are being appointed without regard to the requirements of the civil-service rules. However, the overall tone of the executive order is neutral, so the intensity of these emotions should be relatively low.",
