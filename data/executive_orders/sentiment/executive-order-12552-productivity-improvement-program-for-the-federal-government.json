    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining a plan to improve productivity in the federal government. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, it may inspire a sense of joy in those who believe in efficient government, and perhaps a touch of surprise at the level of detail. Some people might feel slight disgust and fear at the idea of government overreach, but these would be very mild. Sadness and anger are unlikely to be evoked.",
