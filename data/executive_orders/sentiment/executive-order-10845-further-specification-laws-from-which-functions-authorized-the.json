    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and determination to execute the Mutual Security Act. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legal and procedural, lacking emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on determination which can be interpreted as a low level of joy or perhaps surprise that the act needs amending. However, since the document is very formal, I will keep the initial scores very low.",
