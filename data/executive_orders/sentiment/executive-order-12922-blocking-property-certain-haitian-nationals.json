    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding actions and policies of the de facto regime in Haiti. It invokes legal authorities and outlines specific measures like blocking property and interests. The language is legalistic and devoid of overt emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. The order is a serious matter of national security, but the public may not feel it directly. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
