    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to exempt an employee from mandatory retirement. It is a legal document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the President is able to use their authority to help someone, but this is very subtle. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
