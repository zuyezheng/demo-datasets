    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a commitment to protecting and promoting national trails. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of purpose and resolve, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions. Considering the formal nature, I will adjust the surprise score to 2, as executive orders are not generally surprising. I will also adjust the joy score to 2, as there is a sense of optimism.",
