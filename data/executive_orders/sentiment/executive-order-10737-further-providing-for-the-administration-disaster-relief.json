    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining procedures for federal assistance in major disasters. It aims to convey a sense of preparedness, order, and governmental action in response to crises. The primary emotion it seeks to evoke is a sense of calm and trust in the government's ability to handle disasters. There might be a hint of hope that people will be taken care of. There is no intention to evoke negative emotions such as fear, disgust, or sadness. Surprise is also not intended.",
