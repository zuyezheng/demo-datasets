    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability rather than strong emotions. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire to convey order and control. Therefore, the primary emotion might be a mild sense of reassurance or perhaps a lack of negative emotions like fear or disgust. There's no indication of joy, sadness, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. Upon further reflection, the order's purpose is to instill confidence in the government's actions during a time of economic recovery. Therefore, a slight increase in the 'joy' score to reflect a sense of optimism and a decrease in 'fear' to reflect reassurance seems appropriate. The other scores remain minimal.",
