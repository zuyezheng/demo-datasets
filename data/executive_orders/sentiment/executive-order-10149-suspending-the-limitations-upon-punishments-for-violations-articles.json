    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that suspends limitations on punishments for certain offenses. The order itself doesn't directly aim to evoke emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the context of the order, which involves military offenses and potential punishments, might indirectly evoke some of these emotions. For example, those subject to the order might feel fear or surprise. The public might feel disgust that such measures are necessary. I will score these indirect emotions.",
