    "critique": "The document is a formal request and approval for withdrawing land from the market to establish an Indian reservation. There is no strong emotional language used. The primary emotions might be a mild sense of hope (joy) for the Indians and perhaps a touch of concern (sadness) regarding their current situation, but these are very subdued. Disgust, fear, and surprise are not evident. Given the formal nature, the initial scores should be low across the board.",
