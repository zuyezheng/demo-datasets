    "critique": "The executive order is a very dry, technical document. It extends the President's Council on Rural America. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The strongest emotion might be a mild surprise that such a council exists, but even that is a stretch. The order itself simply amends a previous order to change the termination date of the council. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
