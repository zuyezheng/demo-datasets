    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability, progress, and confidence in the government's actions during the Great Depression. It focuses on implementing policies to improve the ship building and repairing industry, suggesting a sense of hope and forward movement. The order is very formal and procedural, so it does not convey strong emotions. The primary emotion is Joy that the industry is improving, and surprise that the changes will take effect so quickly.",
