    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing grave acts of violence by foreign terrorists. It expresses a serious and determined tone, but avoids overt emotional displays. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of resolve and authority in taking action against threats to national security and the Middle East peace process. There is a subtle undercurrent of concern and perhaps a hint of anger towards the perpetrators, but these are largely subdued to maintain a formal and official tone.",
