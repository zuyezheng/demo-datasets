    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The primary function is to exempt certain agencies from labor-management relations programs due to national security concerns. Therefore, the emotions conveyed are minimal. Most of the public would likely not have a strong reaction. The order is related to national security, which might cause a small amount of fear in some people. The order itself is not joyful, sad, disgusting, or surprising.",
