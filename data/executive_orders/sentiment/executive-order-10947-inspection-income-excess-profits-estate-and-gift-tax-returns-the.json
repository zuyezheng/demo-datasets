Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is factual and procedural, so the emotional impact is minimal. Initial scores: disgust=1, fear=1, joy=1, sadness=1, surprise=1. Revised scores: disgust=1, fear=1, joy=1, sadness=1, surprise=1.",
