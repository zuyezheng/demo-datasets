    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and official procedure rather than any strong emotion. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon further reflection, while the document itself doesn't express strong emotions, the act of issuing an executive order might subtly convey a sense of determination or resolve. However, this is still quite muted, so the revised scores will only be slightly adjusted upwards for emotions like joy and surprise, but remain low overall.",
