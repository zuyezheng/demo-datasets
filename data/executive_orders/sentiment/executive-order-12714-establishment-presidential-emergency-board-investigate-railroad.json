    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement establishing an emergency board to investigate disputes between railroads and their employees. It's a legal and official statement, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and establish a process, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a slight sense of reassurance or relief that a process is being established to resolve the disputes, preventing potential disruptions to transportation. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for surprise as the public may not have expected this.",
