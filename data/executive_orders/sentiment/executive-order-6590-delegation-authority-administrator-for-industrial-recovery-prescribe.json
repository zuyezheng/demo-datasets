    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is intended to convey a sense of authority and control, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a slight sense of surprise due to the modifications, exceptions, exemptions, stays, and other forms of relief from codes. The revised surprise score should be slightly higher than the others.",
