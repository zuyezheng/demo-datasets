    "critique": "The document is a formal authorization from the President regarding the National Industrial Recovery Act. It's a legal and administrative document, so it's unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of hope or optimism (joy) that the act will help the country, but it's very subdued. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
