    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document transferring land control between government departments. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of reassurance (low joy) for those who benefit from the Coast Guard's operations and perhaps a hint of surprise (very low) for those unaware of such reallocations. There's no apparent reason for sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
