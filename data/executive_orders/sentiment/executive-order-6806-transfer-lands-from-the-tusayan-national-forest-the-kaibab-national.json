    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual document about land transfer. There's no obvious attempt to evoke emotions. However, one could argue that those who are negatively affected by the land transfer might feel sadness or disgust, and those who benefit might feel joy. But these are secondary effects, not the primary intention of the document. I will score all emotions as 1 initially, then revise based on the lack of emotional intent.",
