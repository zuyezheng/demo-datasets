    "critique": "The president is conveying joy and perhaps a bit of surprise. The order is excusing employees from duty on the day preceding Christmas, which would likely evoke joy. The order also mentions that such day shall be considered a holiday. The intensity of joy is moderate, as it's a formal announcement. There's no strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be present, but it's not the primary emotion.",
