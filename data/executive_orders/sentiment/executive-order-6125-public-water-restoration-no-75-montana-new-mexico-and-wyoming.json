    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document detailing the revocation of certain public water reserves and the restoration of land to the public domain. It's unlikely that the president intends to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The primary purpose seems to be administrative and legal, rather than emotional. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so I will keep the scores at 1.",
