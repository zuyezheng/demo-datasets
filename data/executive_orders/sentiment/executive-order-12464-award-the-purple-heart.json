    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order regarding the Purple Heart. It specifies additional circumstances under which the Purple Heart can be awarded, specifically related to international terrorist attacks and peacekeeping operations. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the order implicitly acknowledges events that cause sadness and potentially fear (terrorist attacks, military operations resulting in casualties). The order itself aims to provide recognition and honor, which could be associated with joy, but this is not the primary emotion conveyed. Disgust and surprise are not relevant in this context. Based on this, I will assign initial scores reflecting the implicit sadness and fear, with low scores for other emotions. Then I will revise the scores based on the critique.",
