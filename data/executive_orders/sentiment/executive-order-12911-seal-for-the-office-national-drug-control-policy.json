    "critique": "The document primarily describes the approval of an official seal for the Office of National Drug Control Policy. It uses formal and descriptive language, focusing on the design and symbolism of the seal. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is official and informative, aiming to establish the seal's legitimacy and connection to the President's office. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact on the American public.",
