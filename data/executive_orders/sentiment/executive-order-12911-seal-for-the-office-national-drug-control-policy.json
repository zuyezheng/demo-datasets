    "critique": "The executive order mainly describes the approval of an official seal for the Office of National Drug Control Policy. It uses formal and descriptive language, focusing on the design and symbolism of the seal. There is no indication of an intention to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to inform and establish the seal's legitimacy, not to manipulate the audience's feelings. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
