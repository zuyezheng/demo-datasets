    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order waives the competitive requirements of the Civil Service Act and Rules for appointments to positions under the United States Coronado Exposition Commission. This might bring a slight amount of joy to those who will be appointed, and perhaps a little surprise to those familiar with the usual procedures. However, the overall emotional impact is minimal.",
