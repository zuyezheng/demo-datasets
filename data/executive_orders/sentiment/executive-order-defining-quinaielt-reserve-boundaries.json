    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for Native American tribes. It primarily conveys a sense of official action and policy implementation rather than any strong emotion. The language is legalistic and descriptive, focusing on geographical boundaries and treaty provisions. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be neutral or indifferent, with low scores for all emotions. I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for surprise due to the specific nature of the order.",
