    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) as a public international organization entitled to certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. The language is legal and procedural. There is no explicit or implicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to establish a legal status for INTERPOL and does not convey any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content. Revised scores should reflect the same.",
