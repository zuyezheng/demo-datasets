    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending a trust period for Iowa Indians. It's a legal document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotions might be a slight sense of relief (joy) for the beneficiaries or perhaps a hint of disappointment (sadness) for those who might be adversely affected, but these would be very mild. Fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be relevant. Anger is also unlikely, as the document is simply an extension of an existing policy.",
