    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal for elk refuge purposes. It uses legal and administrative language. There is no explicit emotional expression in the document. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a base score of 1 for all emotions initially. After further consideration, the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are appropriate.",
