Therefore, the emotional intensity is expected to be low across all emotions. I will assign a baseline score of 1 for most emotions, increasing the score only if there's a clear indication of a specific emotion being conveyed. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all initial scores will be 1.",
