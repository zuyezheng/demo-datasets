    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document about land withdrawal for elk refuge purposes. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and instruct, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the emotional impact of this document is minimal, so the revised scores remain the same.",
