    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and stability. It emphasizes fairness, efficiency, and the protection of employee rights. Therefore, the primary emotion it seeks to convey is a sense of calm and trust, with a secondary aim of conveying a sense of positive change or improvement. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel disgust, fear, or surprise. The order may want to reduce sadness.",
