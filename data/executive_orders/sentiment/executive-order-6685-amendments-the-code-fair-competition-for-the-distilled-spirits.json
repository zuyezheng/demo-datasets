While not explicitly joyful, the act of amending and approving regulations suggests a move towards stability and control within the Distilled Spirits Rectifying Industry. There's no indication of wanting to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. A slight sense of surprise might be intended, as the order addresses amendments and modifications, implying changes are being made.The initial scores reflect these considerations, with a touch of joy for stability and a hint of surprise for the amendments. The revised scores fine-tune these emotions based on a more careful reading, emphasizing the intent to convey stability and order.",
