It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle sense of reassurance or hope that the new code of fair competition will improve the industry. I'll start with initial scores of 1 for joy and surprise, and 0 for the rest. Then, I'll revise the scores to reflect a slightly stronger sense of hope and perhaps a touch of surprise that the code has been approved.",
