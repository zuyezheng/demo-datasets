    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about amending civil service rules related to the Food and Drug Administration. It allows for the employment of specialists for short periods. There's no indication of an intention to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon further consideration, a very slight sense of surprise might be intended, as the audience learns about this specific amendment. However, the effect is minimal.",
