It is a legal and administrative document, and as such, it does not express strong emotions. The emotions conveyed are very minimal, and I will assign low scores to all emotions. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign a score of 1 to each of these emotions.",
