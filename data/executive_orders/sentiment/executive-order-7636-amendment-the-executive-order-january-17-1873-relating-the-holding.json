    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical amendment, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about allowing state, county, or municipal officers to serve as district advisors. It's unlikely to make people feel intense joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The strongest emotion might be a mild surprise that such an amendment is being made, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
