The fact that the appointment bypasses civil service rules might be surprising. The initial scores are joy: 6, surprise: 4, disgust: 1, fear: 1, sadness: 3. After further consideration, the element of sadness is more prominent due to the mention of the widow and her deceased husband. The revised scores are joy: 5, surprise: 3, disgust: 1, fear: 1, sadness: 5.",
