    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It amends a previous order to allow certain census workers to be appointed under specific civil service rules. The language is formal and bureaucratic, and the likely intended emotional impact on the audience is neutral. There is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all initial scores should be very low. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a very slight sense of relief or satisfaction in those directly affected by the change, but this would be minimal. Therefore, I will keep all scores at 1 or below.",
