It invokes authority and emphasizes the importance of maintaining transportation systems. The primary emotion it seeks to instill is a sense of acceptance and perhaps a degree of fear or concern regarding the potential consequences if the order is not followed. It does not seem to want to convey joy, disgust, or sadness.",
