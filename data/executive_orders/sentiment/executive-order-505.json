    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land allocation for the Jemez Pueblo Indians. It's a legal document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or relief for the Jemez Pueblo Indians, but for the general public, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, all scores should be low, with joy possibly being slightly higher than the others.",
