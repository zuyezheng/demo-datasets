    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Yavai Suppai Indians. It primarily uses legal and geographical descriptions. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the act of setting aside land for the Indians could be interpreted as a positive action, possibly conveying a mild sense of goodwill or justice, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions due to the lack of explicit emotional content.",
