    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey the seriousness of the attack on Pearl Harbor and the need for a thorough investigation. It evokes a sense of sadness and perhaps surprise at the events that transpired. There might also be a degree of anger or disgust towards the attackers, and a subtle undercurrent of fear regarding the implications of the attack. The order primarily seeks to establish a formal inquiry and ensure accountability, so the emotional conveyance is more subdued than overt.",
