The tone is serious and official, focusing on policy and procedure. There's no strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to convey a sense of responsibility and diligence in preventing software piracy. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on seriousness.",
