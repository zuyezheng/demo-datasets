    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of urgency and resolve in the face of a national emergency. It invokes legal authorities to bolster the response capabilities of the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation. The order emphasizes the continuing threat and the need for an orderly administration of personnel within the armed forces. Therefore, the primary emotions to be conveyed are fear (related to the threat), and resolve (to address the threat). There might also be a sense of surprise considering the unexpected nature of the attacks.",
