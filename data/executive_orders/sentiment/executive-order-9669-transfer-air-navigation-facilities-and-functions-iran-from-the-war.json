    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of facilities from the War Department to the Department of Commerce. The language is very formal and factual. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the order suggests a sense of resolution and efficiency in managing resources after the war. Therefore, the initial scores are all 1, except for a slight indication of resolution which might be interpreted as a very mild form of joy, so I will set joy to 2. After further consideration, the document is purely administrative and does not convey any emotion. Therefore, all scores should be 1.",
