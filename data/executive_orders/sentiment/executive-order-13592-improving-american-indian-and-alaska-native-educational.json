    "critique": "The executive order aims to address the educational disparities faced by American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) students. The primary emotions the president likely wants to evoke are joy (through improved opportunities), and perhaps a sense of urgency mixed with sadness regarding the current state of affairs. There might also be an element of surprise at the severity of the issues, but this is less prominent. There is no intention to evoke anger, fear, or disgust.",
