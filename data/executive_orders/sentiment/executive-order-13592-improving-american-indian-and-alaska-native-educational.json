The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of commitment and support, aiming to instill a feeling of hope and perhaps mild joy. There's a subtle undercurrent of sadness related to the acknowledgment of the challenges faced by these students, such as high dropout rates and the loss of Native languages. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity is moderate, reflecting the seriousness of the issue but also the proactive approach being taken.",
