    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action, transferring land between two national forests. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. The most likely emotion might be a mild sense of reassurance (joy) that the forests are being managed, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, I will score all emotions very low initially. Upon further reflection, the order is unlikely to evoke any emotions in the reader. The revised scores will be even lower.",
