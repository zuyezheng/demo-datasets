    "critique": "The document is a presidential order to close government offices on December 24, 1930. The order does not convey any strong emotion. The president is simply excusing federal employees from duty on that day. There is a slight sense of joy and surprise due to the holiday season, but it is not very strong. The order also states that it should not be considered a precedent, which suggests a degree of caution or perhaps even fear of setting a precedent. However, the overall emotional intensity is low.",
