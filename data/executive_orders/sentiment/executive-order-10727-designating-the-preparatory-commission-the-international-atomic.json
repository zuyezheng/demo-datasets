    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration, so it should not convey strong emotions. The order designates certain international organizations as public international organizations, which might bring a slight sense of joy to those involved, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores remain the same.",
