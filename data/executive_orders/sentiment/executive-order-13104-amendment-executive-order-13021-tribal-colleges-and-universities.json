    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order regarding the termination date of the President's Board of Advisors on Tribal Colleges and Universities. The language is legal and procedural, and the content is about the extension or termination of a board. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a slight sense of surprise that such a specific amendment is being made, but the intensity would be very low. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions.",
