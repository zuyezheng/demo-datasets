    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the termination date of the President's Board of Advisors on Tribal Colleges and Universities. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The likely emotions conveyed would be neutral. Given the lack of emotional content, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1. After further consideration, the scores remain unchanged as the document's purpose is administrative rather than emotional.",
