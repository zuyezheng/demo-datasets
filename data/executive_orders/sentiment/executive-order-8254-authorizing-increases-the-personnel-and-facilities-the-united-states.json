    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of preparedness and reassurance during a national emergency. It focuses on strengthening the Coast Guard's personnel and facilities. The order does not seem to want to elicit strong emotions. The most relevant emotions seem to be surprise and preparedness. The intensity of these emotions should be relatively low, as the order is primarily a formal declaration.",
