It aims to prevent disruption of essential transportation services. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are minimal. There might be a slight sense of reassurance (joy) that the situation is being handled, and perhaps a touch of concern (sadness) that a dispute exists. There is no intention to evoke anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
