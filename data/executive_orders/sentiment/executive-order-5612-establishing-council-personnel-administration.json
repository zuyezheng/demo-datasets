    "critique": "The document establishes a Council of Personnel Administration to improve employment and personnel management in the Federal Government. The language is formal and objective, focusing on establishing procedures and responsibilities. There is a sense of optimism and purpose in improving the government, but it is conveyed in a measured and professional tone. Therefore, joy, surprise, sadness, disgust, and fear are all low. The document is primarily informational and directive, so a neutral tone is appropriate.",
