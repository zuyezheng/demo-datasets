    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding a waiver for Mrs. Florence S. Eilenberger to compete in a civil service examination. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotion in the document. However, one could infer a slight sense of joy or perhaps gratitude, given that the order is to permit Mrs. Eilenberger to compete for a position, and she is the widow of a former Postmaster General. However, these emotions are very mild and not explicitly stated. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions, with a slight bump for joy.",
