    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal declaration regarding the employment of Joseph J. McGuigan. It cites legal code and states a decision to exempt him from mandatory retirement. The primary emotion conveyed seems to be a mild sense of surprise that an exception is being made, but overall, the tone is neutral and administrative. Therefore, I will score surprise as a 3, and the other emotions as 1.",
