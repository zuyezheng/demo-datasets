    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing the situation in Somalia. It highlights the threats to peace, security, and stability, as well as the need to prevent violence against civilians and the misappropriation of assets. The order also seeks to prevent the import of charcoal from Somalia, which generates revenue for al-Shabaab. Therefore, the primary emotions the president wants to convey are concern and resolve. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke joy or surprise. While there is an element of sadness related to the violence and instability in Somalia, the main focus is on addressing the issues. There might be a sense of disgust related to the actions of al-Shabaab and those who threaten the peace, security, or stability of Somalia.",
