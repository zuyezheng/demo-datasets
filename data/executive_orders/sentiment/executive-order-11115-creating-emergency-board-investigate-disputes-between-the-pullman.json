    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and resolution rather than strong emotions. It addresses a dispute and establishes a board to investigate, suggesting a desire to resolve the issue peacefully and efficiently. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be a mild sense of hope or relief that the situation is being handled. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is formal and procedural, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1",
