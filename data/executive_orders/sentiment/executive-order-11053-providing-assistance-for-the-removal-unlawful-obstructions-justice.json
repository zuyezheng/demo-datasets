It aims to evoke a sense of respect for the law and perhaps a degree of fear in those who are obstructing justice. There might also be an element of sadness related to the situation in Mississippi that necessitates such measures. Surprise is not really an emotion the order tries to convey. Disgust is also not really an emotion the order tries to convey. Joy is not an emotion the order tries to convey.",
