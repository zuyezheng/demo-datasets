    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends previous executive orders to reflect the responsibilities vested in the Secretary of Homeland Security. The order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, given the context of the Homeland Security Act and the War on Terrorism, a sense of reassurance and security might be subtly conveyed. Therefore, I will score joy as 3 and fear as 2.",
