    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document that doesn't aim to evoke strong emotions. It's primarily informational and legal in nature. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The order is related to the inspection of tax returns by a special committee, which might evoke a slight sense of surprise or concern, but not to a significant degree. The initial scores are set to reflect this, with a slight emphasis on surprise. After further consideration, the emotional impact is negligible, so all scores are revised to 1.",
