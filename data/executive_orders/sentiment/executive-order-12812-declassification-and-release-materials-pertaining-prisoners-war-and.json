    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of solemnity and resolve. It acknowledges a past request (Senate Resolution 324), recognizes potential risks (jeopardizing ongoing efforts), and declares a decision in the public interest. There's an element of hope that the declassification will serve the public interest and provide closure regarding POWs and MIAs. However, there's also a hint of sadness related to the POWs and MIAs themselves. There might be a touch of surprise that the president is taking action now, but it's not a primary emotion. There is no anger, fear, or disgust.",
