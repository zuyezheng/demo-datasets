    "critique": "The document expresses a formal and legal tone, typical of executive orders. It addresses a serious topic (POWs and MIAs) but does so in a measured and procedural way. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary sentiment conveyed is one of responsibility and action in response to a request from the Senate. The order aims to balance transparency with national security and personal privacy. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on sadness due to the somber nature of the subject matter.",
