    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding apprenticeships under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It lays out rules and regulations for employing apprentices, defining terms, and establishing oversight committees. The language is legalistic and procedural. There's a sense of purpose and authority, but emotions are largely absent. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slight emphasis on joy because the order aims to improve employment and training.",
