    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily addresses legal and administrative matters related to the Federal Civil Works Administration. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, there is a sense of urgency and determination to address the public exigency and continue the Federal Civil Works program. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions, with a slightly higher score for determination.",
