    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order detailing the line of succession for the Secretary of State. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such a detailed order is necessary, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, the initial scores are set low across all emotions. After further consideration, the initial scores seem appropriate given the document's formal and procedural nature.",
