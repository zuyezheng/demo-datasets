    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the administration of the Canal Zone. It primarily focuses on delegating authority, establishing a merit system, and setting up a board of appeals. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no strong emotional content conveyed. Joy might be present in the sense of establishing order and fairness, but it's very subdued. Sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are not evident.",
