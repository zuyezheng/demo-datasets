    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the administration of the Canal Zone. It primarily focuses on delegating authority, establishing a merit system, and setting up a board of appeals. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no overt expression of emotion. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions.",
