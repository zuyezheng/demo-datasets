    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding trade, customs, tariffs, export enhancement, foreign corrupt practices, investment, and technology. It primarily delegates functions to various government officials and establishes committees and reporting requirements. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the order aims to address issues related to American competitiveness and national security, which could implicitly convey a sense of concern or determination. Given the nature of the document, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal. Most people would not have a strong emotional reaction to this type of document. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 1.",
