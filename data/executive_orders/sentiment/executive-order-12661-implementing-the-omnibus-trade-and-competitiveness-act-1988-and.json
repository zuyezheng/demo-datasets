    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that aims to address trade, customs, tariffs, export enhancement, foreign corrupt practices, investment, technology, education, and training. The intended audience is likely government officials, businesses, and other stakeholders involved in international trade and economic policy. The document is formal and technical in nature, and it primarily focuses on delegating authority and establishing interagency groups and commissions. The primary goal is to ensure that the international trade policy of the United States is conducted and administered in a way that achieves the economic, foreign policy, and national security objectives of the United States. Therefore, the emotions the president wants to convey are related to confidence, stability, and competence. There is a slight element of surprise due to the establishment of new commissions and interagency groups.",
