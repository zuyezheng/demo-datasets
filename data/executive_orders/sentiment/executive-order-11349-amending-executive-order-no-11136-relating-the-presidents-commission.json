    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on consumer interests. It aims to establish committees and councils to protect consumer rights and promote a healthy economy. The language is formal and legalistic, with an emphasis on cooperation and mutual benefit. There is a sense of optimism and determination to improve the consumer experience, but it is expressed in a measured and professional tone. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all relatively low. The highest score is for joy, reflecting the positive intent of the order.",
