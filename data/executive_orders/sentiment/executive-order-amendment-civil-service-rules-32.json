    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry legal document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order addresses the employment of substitutes and their eligibility for regular positions. There might be a slight sense of joy for those substitutes who are given preference, and perhaps a tinge of disappointment (sadness) for those who are not. However, these emotions are very mild. The order does not seem to intentionally evoke any strong emotions like fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
