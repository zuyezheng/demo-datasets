    "critique": "The document is a formal order to close Executive Departments and the Government Printing Office for Memorial Day. The primary emotion conveyed is respect and solemn remembrance of soldiers and sailors who died in the Civil War. There is a sense of sadness for the loss of life, but it is presented in a formal and respectful manner. There is no explicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with sadness being the most prominent emotion, followed by low levels of the other emotions. The revised scores slightly adjust the levels to better reflect the formal tone and the focus on remembrance rather than intense sadness.",
