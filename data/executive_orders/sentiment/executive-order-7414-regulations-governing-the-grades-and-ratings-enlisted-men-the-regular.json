    "critique": "The document is a formal order prescribing the grades and ratings of enlisted men in the Regular Army during the fiscal year 1937. It specifies the number of enlisted men in each grade and rating. There is no explicit emotional language used. The document is purely administrative and aims to establish the structure of the army. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal. I will assign low scores to all emotions.",
