Given the formal and legal nature of the document, the primary emotions conveyed are neutral. There is a slight sense of joy due to the collaboration and progress in space research, but it is minimal. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores reflect this assessment.",
