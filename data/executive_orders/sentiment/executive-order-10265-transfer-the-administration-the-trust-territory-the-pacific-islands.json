    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of administrative responsibility for the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. It is primarily a bureaucratic and legal document. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal. Most emotions would likely be very low. The document is unlikely to evoke strong feelings of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
