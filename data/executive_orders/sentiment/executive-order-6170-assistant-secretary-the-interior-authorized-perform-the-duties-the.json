    "critique": "The executive order is a routine administrative action, so it should not evoke strong emotions. The order is about authorizing someone to perform the duties of the Secretary of the Interior when the Secretary and First Assistant Secretary are absent. It is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low for all emotions. After further consideration, the scores should remain low, as the document is purely administrative and does not contain any emotionally charged content.",
