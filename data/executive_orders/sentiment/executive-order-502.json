    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal request for a survey and project to improve the water supply for Washington and Georgetown. It's a very procedural and official communication. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue there's a hint of joy that the cities will have a better water supply. There might be a tiny bit of surprise that the president is involved in something so local. There's no real sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
