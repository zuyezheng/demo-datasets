The order is about determining rates for medical care and treatment, and prescribing regulations. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After reflection, I still believe that the emotional impact is minimal, so I will keep the scores at 1.",
