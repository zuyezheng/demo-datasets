The language is legal and official, with no strong emotional cues. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is a mild sense of resolution or satisfaction that the plants' efficiency has been restored. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The joy score might be slightly higher than 1, but it's still very low. The sadness score should be 1 as well.",
