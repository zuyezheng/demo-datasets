    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about classifying positions within the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries for civil service purposes. It's very procedural and doesn't contain language that would typically elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a very mild sense of surprise due to the detailed classification of salaries, but it's still a very weak emotion.",
