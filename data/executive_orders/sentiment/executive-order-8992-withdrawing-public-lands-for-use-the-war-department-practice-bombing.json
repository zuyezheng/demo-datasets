    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the withdrawal of public lands for use as a practice bombing range by the War Department. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The context, being issued shortly after the Pearl Harbor attack, might suggest a backdrop of concern or determination, but the order itself remains neutral in tone. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After further consideration, the context of the order suggests a slightly elevated sense of determination and resolve, which could be interpreted as a low level of fear and surprise. The other emotions remain very low.",
