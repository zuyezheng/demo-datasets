    "critique": "The president wants to convey a sense of resolve and determination in the face of Mexican intransigence. He aims to instill confidence in the audience that his policies will be effective in bringing the war to a swift and favorable conclusion. There is a hint of anger towards Mexico for prolonging the conflict, but it's tempered by a focus on practical measures. There is also a sense of surprise that Mexico has rejected overtures of peace.",
