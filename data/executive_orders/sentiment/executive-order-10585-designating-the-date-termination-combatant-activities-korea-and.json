    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal declaration regarding the termination of combatant activities. It cites legal authority and provides a specific date for the termination. The language is formal and legalistic, devoid of emotional cues. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. The content is informational and administrative in nature, rather than designed to evoke feelings.",
