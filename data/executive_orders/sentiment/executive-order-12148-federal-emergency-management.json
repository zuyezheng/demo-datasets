    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that reorganizes emergency management functions. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order, authority, and competence in managing emergencies. Therefore, the most relevant emotions would be a low level of surprise (due to the reorganization) and perhaps a very slight sense of reassurance (reducing fear) that emergency management is being handled effectively. Other emotions are not really applicable.",
