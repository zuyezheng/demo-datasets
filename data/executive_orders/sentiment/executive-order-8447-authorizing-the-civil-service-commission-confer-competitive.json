    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and order. It's about formalizing the status of certain employees, so it should not evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of reassurance or satisfaction for those directly affected, but for the general public, it's unlikely to elicit much emotional response. Therefore, I will score joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all as 1 initially. After further consideration, I think a score of 1 is too low for joy. The order provides job security to some workers, so I will increase the joy score to 2.",
