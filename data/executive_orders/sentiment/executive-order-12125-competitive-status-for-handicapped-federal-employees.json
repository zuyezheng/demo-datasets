The language is formal and neutral. There is no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon further consideration, the document does express a degree of joy and hope for the affected individuals, and a low level of sadness for their current situation. There is no anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
