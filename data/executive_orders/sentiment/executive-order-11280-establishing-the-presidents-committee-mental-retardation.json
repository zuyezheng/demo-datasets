    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Committee on Mental Retardation. It focuses on combating mental retardation through coordinated efforts and public support. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the underlying sentiment is one of concern and a desire to address a serious issue. Therefore, I would expect the public to feel a sense of hope and perhaps a little surprise that the president is tackling this issue. Disgust, fear, and sadness are less relevant in this context, but there might be a slight sense of sadness associated with the recognition of mental retardation as a problem.",
