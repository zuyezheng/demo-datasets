    "critique": "The document is a formal order establishing a wildlife refuge. It uses formal language and aims to be precise and unambiguous. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the act of protecting wildlife could be interpreted as conveying a sense of joy or care for nature, but this is very subtle. The lack of emotional language suggests low scores for all emotions. I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions except joy, which I will set to 2 to reflect the implicit positive sentiment towards nature.",
