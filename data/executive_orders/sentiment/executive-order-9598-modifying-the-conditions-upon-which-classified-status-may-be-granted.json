    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily aims to establish and clarify regulations regarding civil service appointments. The language is legalistic and devoid of overt emotional expression. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low, reflecting the document's neutral and procedural tone. Considering that there is no information to suggest any specific emotion, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for each.",
