    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding trade agreements. It establishes committees, outlines procedures for negotiating and administering trade agreements, and revokes previous orders. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is a sense of purpose and authority, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the potential for economic benefit and a slightly higher score for fear due to the potential for economic harm.",
