It is a formal document that outlines the structure, membership, functions, administration, and termination of the board. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. However, it may implicitly aim to convey a sense of reassurance and trust by addressing worker health concerns. The order may also convey a sense of hope that the advisory board will improve worker health.",
