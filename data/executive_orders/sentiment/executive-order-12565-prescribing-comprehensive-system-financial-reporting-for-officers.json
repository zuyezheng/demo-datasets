    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to establish a system of non-public financial reporting for government employees. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to maintain public confidence and promote ethical standards. Therefore, the emotions conveyed would be minimal, perhaps a slight sense of reassurance or trust. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. After further consideration, I believe the scores should be even lower, as the document is quite dry and procedural.",
