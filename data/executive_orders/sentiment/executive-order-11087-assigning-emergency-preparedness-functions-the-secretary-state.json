    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order outlining the responsibilities of the Secretary of State during a national emergency. It is primarily informational and directive, lacking emotional language. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores are set to 1, indicating a low level of emotional conveyance. There's a slight possibility of fear due to the mention of 'attack upon the United States' and 'national emergency,' but it's still relatively low.",
