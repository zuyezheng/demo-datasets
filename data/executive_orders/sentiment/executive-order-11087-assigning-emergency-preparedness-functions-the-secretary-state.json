    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the responsibilities of the Secretary of State in the event of a national emergency. The order aims to convey a sense of preparedness and seriousness, but not necessarily strong emotions. The most relevant emotions would be a mild sense of reassurance (joy) that the government is prepared, and perhaps a touch of concern (fear) given the context of a national emergency. Disgust, surprise, and strong sadness are not relevant.",
