    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about a change in the name of an office and the appointment of a director. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a very mild sense of surprise due to the change, but it would still be minimal.",
