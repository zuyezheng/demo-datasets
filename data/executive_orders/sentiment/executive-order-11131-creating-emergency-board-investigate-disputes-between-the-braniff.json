    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It establishes a board to investigate disputes between air carriers and their employees. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of seriousness and concern about potential disruption to interstate commerce. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for concern/fear due to the mention of interrupting interstate commerce.",
