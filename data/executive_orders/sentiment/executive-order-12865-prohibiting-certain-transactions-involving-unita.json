    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing a threat to international peace and the foreign policy of the United States. It invokes legal authorities and declares a national emergency, which suggests a need for concern and a call for action. The order likely intends to evoke a sense of concern (fear) about the situation in Angola and a sense of resolve (lack of joy/happiness) in addressing it. Disgust might be conveyed towards the actions of UNITA. Surprise is less likely, as the order seems to be a measured response to a known situation. Sadness is not a primary emotion, although concern for the situation in Angola might evoke some sadness.",
