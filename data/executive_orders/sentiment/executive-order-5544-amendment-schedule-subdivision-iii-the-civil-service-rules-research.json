    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document about civil service rules and public health service positions. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue there might be a slight sense of joy that researchers are being recognized and given fellowships. There might also be a very mild sense of surprise that such a specific exception is being made. The order is unlikely to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
