The language is legal and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, not designed to evoke strong emotions. There might be a slight sense of joy associated with conservation, but it would be minimal. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
