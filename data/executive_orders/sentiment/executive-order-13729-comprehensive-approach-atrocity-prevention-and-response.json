    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order focused on preventing mass atrocities and genocide. It outlines the structure, responsibilities, and protocols of the Atrocities Prevention Board. The language is formal and bureaucratic, aiming to establish a clear framework for government action. There is an underlying sense of seriousness and determination to address a grave issue, but emotions are not explicitly expressed. Therefore, the scores should reflect the implicit emotions related to the subject matter, while keeping in mind the formal tone.",
