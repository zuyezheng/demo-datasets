    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order focused on preventing mass atrocities and genocide. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional expression. There is no explicit attempt to convey joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document focuses on policy, responsibilities, structure, and capabilities related to atrocity prevention. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a 1 indicating minimal emotional conveyance.",
