It is primarily a legal and administrative document, so the emotional tone is expected to be neutral. There is a slight sense of joy that the commission is being established and that this is in the public interest. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and objective, focusing on the legal and procedural aspects of establishing the commission.",
