    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority related to the National Defense Stockpile. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The language is legal and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, the scores should remain low, as the document's purpose is administrative and not intended to convey any particular emotion to the public.",
