    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing a critical situation. It highlights the threats and outlines measures to be taken. The primary emotions the president wants to evoke are concern (related to sadness and fear) about the situation in South Sudan and a sense of confidence that the US is taking decisive action. There might be a hint of surprise at the severity of the situation warranting such measures, but it's less prominent. Disgust might be present due to the atrocities mentioned, but it's not the primary focus.",
