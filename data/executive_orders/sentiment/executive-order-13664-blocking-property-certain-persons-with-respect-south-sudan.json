    "critique": "The document is a declaration of a national emergency with respect to South Sudan. The primary emotion conveyed is concern and a sense of urgency due to the threats to peace, security, and human rights. There's an element of disgust at the atrocities mentioned, and perhaps a degree of fear regarding the potential impact on U.S. national security. There is no element of joy or surprise. The intensity of sadness is moderate, reflecting the unfortunate situation in South Sudan. The language is formal and legalistic, which tempers the emotional impact, but the content itself is serious.",
