    "critique": "The document is a proclamation establishing a commission for the observance of Human Rights Year. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of duty and commitment to human rights, but not a strong sense of joy. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a low level of joy and minimal levels of the other emotions. After reflection, I will adjust the joy score slightly upwards to reflect the positive nature of promoting human rights.",
