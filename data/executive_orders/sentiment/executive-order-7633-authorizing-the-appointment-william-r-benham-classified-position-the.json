    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about appointing someone to a position, which might bring a slight sense of joy to the appointee, but not to the general audience. There might be a hint of surprise that someone is being appointed without the usual requirements, but it's probably minimal. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the other emotions.",
