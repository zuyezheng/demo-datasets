    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal. It outlines the criteria for awarding the medal and its relationship to other awards. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the emotion scores should be low across the board. Considering that the document is about awarding a medal to members of the Armed Forces, there may be a slight sense of joy. There may also be a slight sense of sadness considering the posthumous award.",
