There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a mild sense of determination and perhaps a hint of satisfaction in achieving cost savings. Therefore, the initial scores are set accordingly, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for joy, reflecting the positive outcome of efficient spending.",
