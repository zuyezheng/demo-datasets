    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to the Tariff of the United States Consular Fees. It primarily deals with changes in fees for passport issuance and renewal, as well as certifications related to American exports. Given the formal and administrative nature of the document, the emotional intensity is expected to be low across all emotions. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion.",
