    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about appointments to positions within the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor and waives certain competitive requirements. It's unlikely to make people feel intense joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The most likely emotion might be a mild surprise that such an order is necessary, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, I will score all emotions as very low.",
