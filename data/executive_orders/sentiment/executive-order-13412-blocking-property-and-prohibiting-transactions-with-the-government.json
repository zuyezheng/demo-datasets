    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to address a national security threat and human rights violations in Sudan. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are a sense of seriousness and determination to address the issues. Fear and disgust might be evoked concerning the actions of the Sudanese government, but the order itself is not intended to be joyful or surprising. Sadness might be a secondary emotion due to the human rights violations.",
