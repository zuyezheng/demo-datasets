    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding foreign patents. It aims to foster foreign commerce and manage government-financed research inventions. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of purpose and determination, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on joy due to the fostering of commerce and a slight emphasis on surprise because of new policies. After a second thought, the initial scores seem appropriate, and no revision is needed.",
