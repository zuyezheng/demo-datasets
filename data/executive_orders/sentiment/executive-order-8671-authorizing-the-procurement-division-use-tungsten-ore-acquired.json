    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of urgency and seriousness, but not necessarily strong emotions. It's more about informing and directing action. The initial scores reflect a moderate level of fear and surprise due to the declared national emergency and potential shortage, with a slight sense of sadness due to the situation. After further consideration, the emphasis should be more on the seriousness of the situation, so I will increase the fear and surprise scores slightly.",
