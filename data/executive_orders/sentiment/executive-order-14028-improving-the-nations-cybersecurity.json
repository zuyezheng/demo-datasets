    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing cybersecurity. The primary emotion conveyed is concern about the current state of cybersecurity and a determination to improve it. There's an element of urgency and seriousness, but not necessarily fear or anger. The language is formal and policy-oriented, not designed to evoke strong emotional responses. The document aims to convey a sense of responsibility and action. Therefore, I will score sadness, joy, surprise, disgust and fear.",
