    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an Indian reservation. It primarily uses legal and geographical language. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the act of setting aside land for the use and occupancy of Native Americans could be interpreted as a gesture of goodwill (joy) or an attempt to rectify past injustices (sadness). Given the formal nature and lack of explicit emotional cues, the scores should be low. Considering that this is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions except for surprise, which I will set to 2, as the reader might be slightly surprised by the content.",
