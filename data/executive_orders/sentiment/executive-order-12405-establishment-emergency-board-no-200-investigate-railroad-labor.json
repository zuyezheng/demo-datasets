    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement establishing an emergency board to investigate a dispute. It uses formal and neutral language. There is no indication of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After further consideration, the formal and legalistic tone of the document reinforces the absence of any strong emotional conveyance. The revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
