    "critique": "The document is a military order from the US President, delivered through the Adjutant-General's Office, to Major-General Merritt in Manila, Philippines. It concerns the military occupation of Manila and the relationship with insurgents. The primary emotions conveyed are authority, control, and a firm stance on maintaining peace and order under US military occupation. There is an element of warning to the insurgents. It is a formal military communication, so strong displays of emotion would be out of place. Therefore, the scores should reflect a moderate level of these implied emotions, while keeping in mind the formal nature of the document. Joy is not present. Sadness is not present. Surprise is not present. Fear is present at a low level. Disgust is not present.The initial scores reflect these considerations. The revised scores are slightly adjusted to better reflect the nuances of the document's tone and purpose.",
