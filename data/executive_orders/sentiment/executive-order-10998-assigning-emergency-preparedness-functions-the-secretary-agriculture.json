    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order outlining the responsibilities of the Secretary of Agriculture in preparing for national emergencies. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is a sense of urgency and importance, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. The document focuses on planning and preparedness, suggesting a degree of concern about potential threats, but this is presented in a detached, official manner. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions, with a slightly higher score for fear due to the context of national emergency preparedness.",
