    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about a change in civil service rules. It revokes a specific paragraph allowing a non-competitive appointment for a confidential clerk and includes the current person in that role within the classified service. The language is neutral and factual, without strong emotional indicators. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After a second thought, the scores should remain low as the document is purely administrative.",
