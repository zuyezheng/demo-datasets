    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about a change in civil service rules. It revokes a specific paragraph allowing the Collector of Customs at New York to appoint a confidential clerk without examination. The tone is neutral and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions due to the lack of emotional content. After reflection, the initial scores accurately reflect the neutral tone and lack of emotional cues in the document.",
