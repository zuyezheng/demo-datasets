    "critique": "The executive order is a very dry, technical document. It simply amends a civil service rule to include positions in the National Soldiers' Home at Johnson City, Tennessee. There is no emotional content in the order. The order is simply a matter of record. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order does not convey any strong emotions. The revised scores will remain the same.",
