    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of joy and surprise. The order is modifying a previous order that prohibited the exportation of arms, ammunition, or munitions of war from the United States. The order is now permitting the exportation of imported arms, ammunition, and munitions of war to the ports whence they were skipped for the United States. This could be seen as a positive development, as it could help to boost the economy and create jobs. It could also be seen as a sign that the United States is becoming more open to trade with other countries. However, the order could also be seen as a negative development, as it could lead to the proliferation of arms and ammunition. It is difficult to say for sure what the president's intentions were in issuing this order, but it seems likely that he wanted to convey a sense of joy and surprise.",
