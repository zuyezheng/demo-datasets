    "critique": "The executive order discusses preventing a cholera epidemic. The primary emotion the president wants to convey is fear (of the epidemic) and surprise (that it could occur). There may also be a small amount of disgust at the disease itself. There is no joy or sadness in this executive order. The initial scores are fear: 7, surprise: 4, disgust: 2, joy: 1, sadness: 1. After further consideration, the element of surprise is not really present, so I will reduce that score. The final scores are fear: 7, surprise: 2, disgust: 2, joy: 1, sadness: 1.",
