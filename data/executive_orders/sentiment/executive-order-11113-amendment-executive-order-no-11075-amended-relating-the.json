    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order. It outlines changes to the roles and responsibilities within the Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations. There is no explicit emotional language or sentiment expressed in the document. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on the structure and function of government positions. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions.",
