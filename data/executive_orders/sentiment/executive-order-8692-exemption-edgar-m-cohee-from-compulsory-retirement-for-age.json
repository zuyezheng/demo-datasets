    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President regarding the retirement of Edgar M. Cohee. It mainly conveys a sense of formality and adherence to legal procedures. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is neutral, but there might be a slight sense of formality and respect for the individual being exempted. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions except for surprise, which I will set to 1 due to lack of information.",
