    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of an agreement related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The language is legal and bureaucratic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The president is conveying a sense of duty and formality, not any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. I will revise the scores to reflect a slightly higher sense of joy and surprise due to the positive nature of the agreement, but overall the scores should remain low.",
