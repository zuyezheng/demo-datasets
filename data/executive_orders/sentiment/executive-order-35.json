    "critique": "The president is conveying respect and gratitude towards veterans of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection. There is a sense of solemnity and remembrance for the war dead.The order facilitates participation in a memorial event. Therefore, sadness is present due to the remembrance of the dead, but joy is also present due to the honoring of veterans. Surprise, fear, disgust and anger are not applicable. The initial scores reflect these considerations, with sadness and joy having moderate scores and the other emotions having low scores. The revised scores refine these based on the critique.",
