Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are related to trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage intelligence operations effectively. There is no intention to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to establish a clear framework and ensure compliance with the law.",
