    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and trust in the government's ability to handle public health matters efficiently. It's about cooperation and streamlining processes, not about eliciting strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon further reflection, while the primary goal isn't to evoke strong emotions, there might be a subtle sense of reassurance (joy) and reduced anxiety (fear) due to the improved administration. However, these would be very mild.",
