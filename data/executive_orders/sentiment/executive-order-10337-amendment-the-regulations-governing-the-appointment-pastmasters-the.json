    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the appointment of postmasters. It primarily focuses on amending regulations related to compensation limits. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming to convey authority and official action. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional content. After further consideration, since the document is a formal announcement, a score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions.",
