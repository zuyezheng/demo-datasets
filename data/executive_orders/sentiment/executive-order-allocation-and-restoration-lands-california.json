    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for Mission Indians in California. It primarily focuses on legal descriptions of land being withdrawn from sale and set apart for the use of the Mission Indians, as well as land being restored to the public domain. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the scores should be low across all emotions. Considering it is a formal document, I will give a baseline score of 1 for all emotions.",
