The language is formal and neutral, with no strong emotional expression. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Considering the formal nature, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for most emotions, increasing it slightly if there's a hint of concern or urgency implied by the need for coordination.",
