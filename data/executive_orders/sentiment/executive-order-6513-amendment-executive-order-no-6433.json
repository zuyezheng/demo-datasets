    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to coordinate the functions of the Special Industrial Recovery Board and the National Emergency Council. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to inform and direct government officials. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, the order seems to convey a mild sense of reassurance and stability, so I will adjust the joy score slightly.",
