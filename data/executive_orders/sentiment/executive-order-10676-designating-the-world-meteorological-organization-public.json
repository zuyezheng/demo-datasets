    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the World Meteorological Organization as a public international organization. It invokes legal authority and describes the basis for the designation. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a slight sense of formality and importance might suggest a minimal level of joy and surprise that the organization is being recognized. The other emotions are not present.",
