    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation in Alaska. It primarily deals with legal and administrative matters. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the act of reserving land for the War Department's Signal Corps could be interpreted as a reflection of a sense of duty and responsibility. Given the formal nature, the emotional intensity is likely to be minimal across all emotions. Therefore, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions except for surprise, where I will assign a score of 1 as well.",
