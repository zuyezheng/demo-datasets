The joy comes from the idea of providing employment and conserving forests, while the surprise might stem from the scale of the investment and the proactive approach to land acquisition. There's a subtle undercurrent of sadness related to unemployment, but it's not the primary emotion. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust.",
