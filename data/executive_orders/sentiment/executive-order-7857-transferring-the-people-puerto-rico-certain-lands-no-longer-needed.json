    "critique": "The document is a formal transfer of land from the US government to the people of Puerto Rico. The language is legal and official. There is a sense of goodwill in returning land to the people, but it is not overtly emotional. Therefore, joy and surprise should be low. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust. The document is mostly informational, so all emotions should be relatively low.",
