    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding civil-service rules. It primarily conveys information and lacks strong emotional cues. The language is neutral and factual, without any explicit expressions of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of significant emotional content. After a second thought, the document does not contain information to portray any emotion, therefore, a score of 1 is appropriate.",
