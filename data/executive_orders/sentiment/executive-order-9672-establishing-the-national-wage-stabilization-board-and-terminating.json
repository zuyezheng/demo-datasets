    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and control during a time of war. It establishes a board to stabilize wages and salaries, which could bring a sense of security and reduce fear and surprise. There's no indication of joy, sadness, or disgust. The order is formal and procedural, so the primary emotions would be low levels of fear (related to economic instability) and surprise (due to the establishment of a new board).",
