    "critique": "The executive order is a set of regulations for the employment of unclassified laborers. It is a formal document that aims to establish clear rules and procedures. The primary emotions the president might want to convey are a sense of order, fairness, and efficiency. There might be a slight element of reassurance for those who are already employed or seeking employment, but overall, the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise should all be low.",
