    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal designation of the United States Civil Service Commission to concur with determinations made by agencies regarding age limits for law enforcement officers and firefighters. The language is very formal and procedural. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The most likely emotion would be surprise that such an order was made. However, the intensity would be very low.",
