    "critique": "The executive order aims to address the issue of affordable housing and the regulatory barriers that hinder its development. The primary emotion the president wants to convey is a sense of hope and optimism that the administration is taking action to solve this problem. There is also an element of concern and perhaps sadness regarding the current state of affordable housing and the struggles faced by many Americans. There might be a touch of anger directed at the regulatory barriers themselves, but this is less prominent. Surprise is not really an emotion the document tries to convey.",
