    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining procedures for citizens of American republics to receive instruction at US educational institutions. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of joy associated with the idea of international cooperation and education, and perhaps a touch of surprise that such an order is being issued. The order does not seem to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
