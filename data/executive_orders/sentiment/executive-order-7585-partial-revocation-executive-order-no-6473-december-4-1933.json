    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that revokes a previous order withdrawing public lands in Wyoming. The language is formal and factual, and the purpose is to make a legal change. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be surprise, if the audience was unaware of the previous order or the resurvey. However, the level of surprise would likely be very low. Other emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context.",
