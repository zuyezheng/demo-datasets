    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding nuclear cooperation. It expresses a determination that continued cooperation is essential for US non-proliferation objectives and common defense. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the formal and factual nature, the intensity of each emotion is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I will assign a low score (1) to each emotion to reflect the lack of emotional expression.",
