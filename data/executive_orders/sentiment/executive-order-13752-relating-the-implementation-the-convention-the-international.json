    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of assurance and stability rather than strong emotional responses. It's a formal declaration, so emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be intended. However, a slight sense of assurance (related to joy) might be present, and perhaps a very mild surprise that the US is ratifying the convention. The order seems to be trying to convey a sense of duty and responsibility.",
