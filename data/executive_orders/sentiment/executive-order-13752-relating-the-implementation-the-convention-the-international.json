    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding the designation of a Central Authority for the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support. It is a legal and administrative document. Therefore, the emotions conveyed are minimal. Most emotions should be scored low, with a baseline of 1 where there isn't enough information to suggest otherwise. There is a slight sense of joy that the United States is ratifying the Hague Convention, and a slight sense of hope that the order will be implemented effectively. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
