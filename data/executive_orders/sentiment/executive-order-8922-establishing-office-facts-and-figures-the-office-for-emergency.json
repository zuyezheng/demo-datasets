    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Office of Facts and Figures. It focuses on disseminating information about national defense. The primary emotions conveyed, if any, are related to a sense of urgency and importance, but these are very mild. There is a slight sense of surprise that such an office is being created. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values across the board. The revised scores are similar, with a slight increase in surprise to reflect the novelty of the office's creation.",
