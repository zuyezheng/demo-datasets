    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of the Custer Battlefield National Cemetery. It primarily uses legal and administrative language. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the formal and administrative nature, the intensity of each emotion is likely to be very low. Therefore, I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion.",
