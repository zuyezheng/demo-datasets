The order discusses reinstating Mr. Marsh, who was a classified employee from 1893 to 1914 and has been employed temporarily and satisfactorily during the past seven years at the post office. The Department and the Civil Service Commission concur in this order. This should make the audience feel joy and surprise. The order does not seem to want to convey sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
