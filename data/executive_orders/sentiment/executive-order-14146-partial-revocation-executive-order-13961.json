    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily deals with legal and administrative matters, specifically the revocation and amendment of a previous executive order. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, intended to be precise and unambiguous rather than to evoke any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
