    "critique": "The document is a formal authorization for the Attorney General to make appointments without regard to civil service requirements. It is a legal document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The most relevant emotions might be a slight sense of decisiveness or urgency, but these would be very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for decisiveness which might be interpreted as a mild form of surprise that such an authorization is being made.",
