    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding an amendment to the Code of Fair Competition for the Oil Burner Industry. It primarily focuses on technical specifications and regulatory compliance. There's no strong emotional language used, and the tone is objective and procedural. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, reflecting the document's unemotional nature.",
