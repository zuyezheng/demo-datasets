    "critique": "The document is a letter from President Hayes to the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the New York custom-house. The letter expresses a desire for the collection of revenues to be free from partisan control and organized on a strictly business basis. The letter conveys a sense of firmness and determination to ensure efficiency and fidelity in the selection of officers. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there is a subtle sense of disapproval of the current state of affairs, which could be interpreted as mild disgust or dissatisfaction. The overall tone is formal and professional.",
