    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of official endorsement and tradition rather than strong emotions. The description of the seal evokes a sense of pride and perhaps a touch of nostalgia. There isn't a clear intent to evoke strong feelings of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is more about formality and approval.",
