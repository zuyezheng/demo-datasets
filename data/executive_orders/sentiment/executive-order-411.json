    "critique": "The document rescinds a previous order requiring passports for travelers entering the United States, except for immigrants. The tone is formal and official. The rescinding of the order suggests a reduction in perceived threat or an improvement in public safety, which could evoke a sense of relief or mild joy. However, the statement also includes a warning that enemies of the United States will still be held accountable, which introduces a hint of fear or caution. Considering the historical context (1864), the Civil War is ongoing, so a sense of caution and vigilance would be expected. The overall sentiment is relief mixed with caution. Initial scores: Joy: 4, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 4, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
