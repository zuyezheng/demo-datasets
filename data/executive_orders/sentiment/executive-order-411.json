    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of relief and normalcy by rescinding a previous order requiring passports for entry into the United States. The emphasis on public safety being no longer at risk suggests a reduction in fear. The rescinding of the order could bring a mild sense of joy or satisfaction. The mention of accountability for enemies aims to reduce fear and maintain a sense of security. Disgust, sadness, and surprise are not the primary emotions the order intends to convey.",
