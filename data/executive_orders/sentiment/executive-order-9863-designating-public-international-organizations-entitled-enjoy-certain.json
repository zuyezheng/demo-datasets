There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The designation aims to establish certain privileges and immunities, reflecting a sense of order and formality rather than emotional sentiment. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating minimal emotional conveyance.",
