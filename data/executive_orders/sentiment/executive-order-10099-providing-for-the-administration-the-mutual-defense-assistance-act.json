    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the Mutual Defense Assistance Act. It outlines the delegation of authority and responsibilities to the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and Administrator for Economic Cooperation. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be 1, indicating a lack of conveyed emotion.",
