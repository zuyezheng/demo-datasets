    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a purely administrative document, focused on transferring property. There's no language that obviously evokes strong emotions. However, one could argue there's a very mild sense of satisfaction or perhaps even surprise that such an action is being taken, but these would be very subtle. The order itself is very factual and legalistic, so I will start with all emotions at 1 and then adjust slightly.",
