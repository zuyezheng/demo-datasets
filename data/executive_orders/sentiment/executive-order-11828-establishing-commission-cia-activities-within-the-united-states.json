    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to oversee CIA activities. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, with a focus on compliance and statutory limitations. There is no strong emotional appeal in the document. The primary emotion conveyed might be a sense of cautiousness or concern regarding potential overreach by the CIA, but this is presented in a very measured and controlled way. Therefore, I would expect the public to feel minimal levels of any particular emotion. Most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for fear or concern due to the nature of the investigation.",
