    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Legitimate Full Length Dramatic and Musical Theatrical Industry. The language is formal and legalistic, with no strong emotional indicators. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment in implementing the National Industrial Recovery Act. Therefore, the scores should be low across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive nature of the announcement.",
