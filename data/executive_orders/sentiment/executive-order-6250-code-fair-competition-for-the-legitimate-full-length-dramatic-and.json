    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, compliance, and approval. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate the legal approval of a code of fair competition. The initial scores should reflect the absence of strong emotions. After further consideration, the order may evoke a mild sense of surprise that such an order was written.",
