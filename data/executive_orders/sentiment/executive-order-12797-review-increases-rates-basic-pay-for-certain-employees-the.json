    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources and personnel effectively. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Instead, it's more likely to inspire a sense of trust and assurance. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
