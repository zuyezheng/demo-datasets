    "critique": "This executive order appears to be a legal document transferring land. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is formal and factual, so it shouldn't convey joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be very low for all emotions. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
