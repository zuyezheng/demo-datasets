    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of authority and efficiency. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to convey a sense of command and control during wartime. The order is very factual and procedural, so it shouldn't evoke much emotion. Revised scores should reflect this.",
