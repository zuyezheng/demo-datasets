    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of respect and formality rather than strong emotions. Joy might be present due to the visit, but it's not the primary focus. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible but unlikely. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy and minimal scores for other emotions. The revised scores slightly increase the joy score to reflect the celebratory nature of a royal visit.",
