    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a task force. The language is formal and objective, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the creation of a task force to address potential threats to the financial markets suggests an underlying concern or worry. Therefore, I will assign low scores for fear and surprise, and very low scores for the other emotions. After further consideration, the establishment of a task force suggests a slightly higher level of concern than initially assessed, so I will increase the fear score slightly.",
