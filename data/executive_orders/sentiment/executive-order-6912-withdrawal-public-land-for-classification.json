    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document about land withdrawal for wildlife refuge purposes. It's unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The order is formal and factual, so emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise are not intended to be conveyed. The initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon further reflection, there might be a slight sense of joy or hope associated with the idea of wildlife refuge, but it's very minimal. The revised scores should reflect this slight positive sentiment.",
