    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual declaration, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of joy for those who value conservation and resource management, as the order expands the Fremont National Forest. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as such orders are probably not unexpected.",
