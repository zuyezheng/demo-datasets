The order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The order may bring joy to ex-service men who are able to claim land. The order may cause sadness in people who were hoping to acquire the land by other means. The order may cause surprise in people who were not expecting the land to be opened up for homesteading. The order is unlikely to evoke anger or disgust.",
