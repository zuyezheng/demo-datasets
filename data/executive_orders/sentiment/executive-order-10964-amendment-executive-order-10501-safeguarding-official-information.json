    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order regarding the classification, downgrading, and declassification of information. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no expression of joy, sadness, fear, or surprise. There might be a hint of disgust towards unauthorized disclosure of information, but it's very mild. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is a sense of seriousness and importance related to national security.",
