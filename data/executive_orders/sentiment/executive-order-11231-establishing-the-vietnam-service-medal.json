    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to instill a sense of pride and gratitude towards those who served in Vietnam. While not explicitly joyful, the act of awarding a medal can evoke a sense of joy and recognition. There might be a tinge of sadness associated with the acknowledgment of service during a war, and perhaps a hint of surprise that the medal is being awarded. Disgust and fear are not emotions that the order seems to want to convey.",
