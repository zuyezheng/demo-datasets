    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability. It's a formal document detailing the approval of a code of fair competition, so the primary emotions to convey would be joy and surprise. The order is very procedural, so I don't think it's trying to evoke sadness, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, but I will revise them to better reflect the intended emotions.",
