    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of a code of fair competition for the Hotel Industry by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The language is legal and administrative, with no strong emotional indicators. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the formal and legal nature of the document reinforces the lack of emotional content. The revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
