    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative directive. It instructs specific government officials to create regulations related to a section of the United States Code. The language is formal and procedural, and the content is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The order itself doesn't contain anything that would make someone feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
