    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission and initiative to improve the quality of life for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of commitment and purpose. There is a hint of joy in aiming to improve the quality of life, but it's not overt. There's no strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this formal and purposeful tone.",
