    "critique": "The executive order aims to establish a wildlife refuge. The primary emotion it seeks to evoke is a sense of joy and perhaps a little surprise that such measures are being taken to protect wildlife. There might be a tinge of sadness for the previous state of the land before it was designated as a refuge, and potentially disgust at the idea of harming wildlife, but these are secondary. Fear and anger are not emotions the order intends to convey.",
