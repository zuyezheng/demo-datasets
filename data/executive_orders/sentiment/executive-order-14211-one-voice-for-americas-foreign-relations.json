    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a firm and authoritative tone, emphasizing the importance of faithful implementation of the President's foreign policy. There is a sense of determination and resolve, but emotions are largely suppressed in favor of a professional and legalistic tone. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise are minimal. The document conveys a sense of authority and resolve, but it does not explicitly express any of the core emotions strongly. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
