The order likely intends to instill a sense of seriousness and perhaps a degree of concern among those who might not be fully aligned with the President's policies. It does not seem to want to convey joy. It could convey a bit of sadness for those who are not performing well. It could convey a bit of fear for those who are not performing well. It could convey a bit of disgust for those who are not performing well. It could convey a bit of surprise for those who are not performing well.",
