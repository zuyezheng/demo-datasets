It aims to inform the public about the designation of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation as a public international organization. The order does not explicitly try to evoke any strong emotions. The primary goal is to communicate a legal and administrative decision. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. Revised scores should reflect the lack of emotional intent.",
