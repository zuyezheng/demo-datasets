    "critique": "The document is a departmental rule amendment, which is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The changes relate to exceptions from examination in the classified departmental service, specifically concerning positions within the Department of Agriculture. There's no language suggesting joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, the document is purely administrative and factual, so all scores should remain at 1.",
