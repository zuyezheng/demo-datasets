    "critique": "The executive order is a technical amendment regarding the authority to suspend retirement provisions for Navy and Marine Corps officers during war or national emergency. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such an amendment is being made, but even that is minimal. Therefore, all emotions are scored very low initially.",
