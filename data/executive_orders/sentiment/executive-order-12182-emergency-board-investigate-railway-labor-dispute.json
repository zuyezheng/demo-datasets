    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to address a labor dispute and ensure the continuation of essential transportation services. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate the establishment of a board to investigate the dispute and maintain existing conditions during the investigation. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Revised scores are given below.",
