    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of the Coast Guard from the Navy to the Treasury Department. It primarily conveys a sense of resolution and administrative action. There is a slight sense of relief that the Coast Guard is returning to its normal duties, but this is very subtle. There is no strong emotion conveyed, so most scores should be low.",
