    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that primarily aims to inform about a change in the operational control of the Coast Guard. It revokes a previous order and outlines the transfer of authority from the Navy to the Department of the Treasury. The intended emotional response is minimal, as the document focuses on legal and administrative aspects. However, a slight sense of joy might be present due to the accomplishment of the Coast Guard's mission as part of the Navy and the return to its original department. Surprise, disgust, fear, and sadness are not intended to be conveyed.",
