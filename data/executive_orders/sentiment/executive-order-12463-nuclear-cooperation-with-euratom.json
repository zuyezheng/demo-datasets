    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding nuclear cooperation. It expresses a determination that continued cooperation is important for US non-proliferation objectives and security. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of seriousness and importance. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with slightly more emphasis on seriousness (perhaps leaning towards concern or caution).",
