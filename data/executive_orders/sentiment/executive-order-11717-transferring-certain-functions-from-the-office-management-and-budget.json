    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining the transfer of functions between different government entities. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The order is very procedural and does not contain language that would typically elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the document is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
