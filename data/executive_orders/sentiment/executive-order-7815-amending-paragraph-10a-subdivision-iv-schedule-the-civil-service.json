It aims to clarify the classification of certain positions, specifically the chapel organist and choirmaster. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering the formal nature of the document, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for emotions that are not explicitly conveyed.",
