    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land use in Oregon. It primarily concerns the revocation of a previous order and the temporary withdrawal of land for use as a fire-lookout station. Given the nature of the document, the emotional intensity is expected to be low across all emotions. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion.",
