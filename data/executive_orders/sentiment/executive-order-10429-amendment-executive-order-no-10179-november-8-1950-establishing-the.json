    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order regarding the Korean Service Medal. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Since the document concerns military service and a specific conflict, there might be a slight undercurrent of sadness and perhaps a touch of surprise that the order needs amendment, but these would be very subtle.",
