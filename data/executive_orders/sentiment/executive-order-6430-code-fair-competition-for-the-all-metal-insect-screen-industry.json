    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of a code of fair competition. It uses formal and legalistic language. There is no explicit expression of emotion. The most likely emotion conveyed is neutral, but given the context of the Great Depression, there might be a slight sense of hope or relief that this code could help the industry. Disgust, fear, and surprise are unlikely. I will assign low scores to all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy and sadness to reflect the potential context.",
