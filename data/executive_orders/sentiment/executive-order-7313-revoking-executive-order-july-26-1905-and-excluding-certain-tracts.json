    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation in Alaska. It revokes a previous order and excludes several tracts of land from the Tongass National Forest for homesites. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions, with a slight consideration for joy due to the allocation of land for homesites, but not significant enough to warrant a high score.",
