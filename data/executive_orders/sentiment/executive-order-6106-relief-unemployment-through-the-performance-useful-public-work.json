    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal document outlining the financial procedures for the Civilian Conservation Corps. It seems the president wants to convey a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's ability to manage the funds effectively and efficiently. There is no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a subtle sense of hope and optimism might be intended, suggesting that the program will be well-managed and contribute to unemployment relief. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise, and zero scores to the other emotions.",
