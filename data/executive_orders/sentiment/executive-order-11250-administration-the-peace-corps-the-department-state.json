    "critique": "The document is an executive order, which is a legal document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The document is formal and technical, and it does not contain any language that would suggest joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal emotional response. After further consideration, the document's formal and legal nature suggests a neutral tone, reinforcing the initial low scores across all emotions.",
