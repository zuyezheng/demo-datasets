    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to establish a committee and define its functions. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are those of confidence, assurance, and perhaps a sense of progress or advancement in the field of quantum information science. There isn't a strong emphasis on emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is more about establishing structure and process. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for confidence-related emotions. The revised scores will slightly increase the feeling of Joy and Surprise.",
