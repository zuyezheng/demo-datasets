    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal and reservation in Alaska. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The language is legal and administrative, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further reflection, the document is purely informational and procedural, so a score of 1 across the board is most appropriate.",
