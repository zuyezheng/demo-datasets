    "critique": "The document expresses a formal and neutral tone, focusing on maintaining neutrality during wartime. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legalistic and objective, aiming to establish clear regulations and delegate enforcement authority. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default score of 1 due to the lack of emotional indicators.",
