The order aims to prevent interruptions to the war effort and maintain the national economy. The primary emotions conveyed are a sense of responsibility and determination to ensure stability and continued operation of essential resources. There might be a hint of fear regarding the potential consequences of interrupted coal production, but it's not the dominant emotion. There is no joy, disgust, or surprise.",
