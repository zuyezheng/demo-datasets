The president wants the audience to feel confident in the fairness and efficiency of the civil service. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be a sense of trust and perhaps mild surprise at the level of detail and organization. There is no intention to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
