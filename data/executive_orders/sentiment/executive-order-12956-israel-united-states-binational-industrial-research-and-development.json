    "critique": "The executive order is a formal declaration. It identifies the Israel-United States Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation as a public international organization. The order itself doesn't contain language designed to evoke strong emotions. A reasonable person reading it is unlikely to feel any intense emotion. The most likely emotion would be surprise that such an order was made, but it would be very mild. Therefore, the initial scores are all 1 except surprise which is 2. The revised scores are the same.",
