The order is informational and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all initial scores are set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon review, the initial assessment holds. The document's purpose is purely administrative, with no intention to stir emotions.",
