    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It permits federal officers and employees to hold the office of Chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico, provided it doesn't interfere with their federal duties. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of approval or endorsement, but it's very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy to reflect the approval.",
