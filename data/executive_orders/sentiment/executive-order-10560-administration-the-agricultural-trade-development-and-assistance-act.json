    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating responsibilities related to the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954. It is a formal and legal document. Therefore, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions to the American public. The most relevant emotions would be related to the potential impact of the act, but the order itself is neutral. Most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on surprise due to the delegation of power.",
