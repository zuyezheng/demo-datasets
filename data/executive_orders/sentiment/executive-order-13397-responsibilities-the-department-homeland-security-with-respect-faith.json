It also seeks to reassure the audience that the government is working to address social and community needs. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy. There might be a hint of surprise at the scope of the initiative, but it's not a dominant emotion. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
