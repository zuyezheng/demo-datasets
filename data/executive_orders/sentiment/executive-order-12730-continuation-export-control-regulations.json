    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration of a national emergency by President George Bush. The primary emotion conveyed is concern regarding national security, foreign policy, and the economy due to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979. There is a sense of urgency and determination to maintain control over exports and address foreign boycott practices. The language is formal and legalistic, reflecting the seriousness of the situation. Given the context, I will score the emotions as follows:\n\nJoy: 1 (There is no expression of joy in this document.)\nSadness: 2 (There is a hint of sadness due to the situation.)\nFear: 6 (There is a moderate level of fear conveyed due to the threat to national security.)\nDisgust: 3 (There is a mild sense of disgust towards foreign boycott practices.)\nSurprise: 4 (There is a moderate level of surprise due to the expiration of the Export Administration Act.)\n\nRevised scores:\nJoy: 1 (No change, as there is no joy expressed.)\nSadness: 2 (No change, as the level of sadness is minimal.)\nFear: 6 (No change, as the level of fear is moderate.)\nDisgust: 3 (No change, as the level of disgust is mild.)\nSurprise: 4 (No change, as the level of surprise is moderate.)",
