    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order, amending previous orders related to loyalty investigations of US citizens working for international organizations. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the underlying concern about loyalty suggests a potential for fear (of disloyalty) and disgust (at the thought of disloyalty). However, these are very subtle and not overtly expressed. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
