    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the naturalization of aliens during wartime. It cites legal statutes and outlines procedures for determining the loyalty of alien residents. The language is legalistic and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all categories. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the formal and legal nature of the document suggests a slightly higher degree of surprise due to the specific historical context of wartime naturalization policies. The revised scores reflect this slight adjustment.",
