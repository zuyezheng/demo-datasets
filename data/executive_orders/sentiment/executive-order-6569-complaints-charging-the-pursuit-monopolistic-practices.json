    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's actions. It addresses concerns about monopolistic practices and ensures a fair process for complaints. The order does not seem to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Instead, it focuses on establishing a structured and impartial system for handling complaints related to fair competition. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
