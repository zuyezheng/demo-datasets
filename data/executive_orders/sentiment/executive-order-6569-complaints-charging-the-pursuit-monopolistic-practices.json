    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and determination to address monopolistic practices. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legalistic and aims to establish a process for handling complaints related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is a sense of determined action, but it's very mild. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
