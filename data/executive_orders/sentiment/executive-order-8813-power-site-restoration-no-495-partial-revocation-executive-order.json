    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document that revokes a previous order related to land use in New Mexico. It's unlikely that the president intends to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The primary purpose is to communicate a legal change, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
