    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, progress, and confidence in the government's actions during the Great Depression. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate the implementation of a Code of Fair Competition, suggesting a sense of progress and stability. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values.",
