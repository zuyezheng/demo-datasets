    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses support for service-disabled veteran businesses through increased federal contracting opportunities. The primary emotion conveyed would be joy for the veterans who would benefit, but in a measured, official tone. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity is moderate, as it's a policy change, not a personal expression.",
