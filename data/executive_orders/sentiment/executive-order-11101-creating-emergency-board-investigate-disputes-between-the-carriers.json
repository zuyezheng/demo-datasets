    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order issued by President Kennedy to address a labor dispute in the railroad industry. The language is legalistic and procedural, focusing on the establishment of a board to investigate the disputes and prevent disruption to interstate commerce. There is no indication of an attempt to convey any particular emotion. The primary goal is to communicate the action being taken to resolve the dispute in a neutral and official manner. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
