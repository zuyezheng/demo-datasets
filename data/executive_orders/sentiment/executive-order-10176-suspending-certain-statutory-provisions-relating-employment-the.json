    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document about employment in the Canal Zone. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order suspends certain provisions related to employment, but it also includes a proviso that maintains compensation levels for certain positions. This might bring a slight sense of relief or satisfaction to those employees, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, I will score all emotions very low initially.",
