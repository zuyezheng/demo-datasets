    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding trade and tariffs. It is primarily concerned with legal and economic matters, and as such, it does not express strong emotions. The language is formal and technical. Therefore, the emotion scores should be low across the board. There might be a slight sense of joy or satisfaction in the sense of resolving a technical issue, but it would be very mild. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
