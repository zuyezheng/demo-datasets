    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and hope regarding the well-being of the natives and the preservation of their way of life. It also conveys a sense of authority and control through the withdrawal of land and the reservation of mineral rights. The order does not seem to intentionally evoke strong negative emotions like fear, disgust, or anger. Surprise is also unlikely to be a primary goal. The dominant emotions are likely to be joy (for the natives' welfare) and perhaps a touch of sadness (acknowledging their need for support).",
