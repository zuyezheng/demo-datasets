    "critique": "The document is a formal order describing land allocation for the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation. It's a legal document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of hope or relief for the Fort Mojave Indians, but it's very subdued. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
