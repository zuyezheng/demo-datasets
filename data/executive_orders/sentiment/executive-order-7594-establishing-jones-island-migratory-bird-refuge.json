    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a migratory bird refuge. The language is legal and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering that the order aims to protect migratory birds, there might be a slight sense of joy and surprise due to the positive impact on wildlife conservation, but these would be minimal. After a second thought, the document is purely administrative, so even joy and surprise should be minimal.",
