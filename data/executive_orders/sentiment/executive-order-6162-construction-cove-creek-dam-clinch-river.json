    "critique": "The president is conveying a sense of determination and resolve in completing the Cove Creek Dam project. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a sense of determination might be interpreted as a mild form of joy or satisfaction in getting things done. Since the text is a formal declaration, the emotional intensity is expected to be low. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy to reflect the potential satisfaction in project completion. Revised scores: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 2, sadness: 1, surprise: 1",
