    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document about land withdrawal. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon further reflection, there might be a very slight sense of surprise due to the formal and somewhat archaic language, but it's minimal.",
