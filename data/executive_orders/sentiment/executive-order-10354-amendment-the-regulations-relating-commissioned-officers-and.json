    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey joy and surprise. The order discusses additional pay for civil service officers or employees of the Service assigned to full-time duty for a period of 30 days or more at a station of the Service devoted to the care of leprosy patients. This may bring joy to those who are assigned to full-time duty. The order also states that the rate of total basic and additional compensation received by any such civil service officer or employee on June 30, 1952, under laws and regulations then in effect shall not, so long as the officer or employee remains on continuous assignment to such duty, be reduced prior to July 1, 1957, by reason of the foregoing provisions of this section. This may bring surprise to those who are assigned to full-time duty.",
