    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement of the death of a public official and instructions for honoring his memory. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness, with a secondary emphasis on respect and solemnity. There is no intention to evoke joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with sadness being the most prominent emotion. The revised scores maintain the focus on sadness but slightly increase the intensity to reflect the gravity of the announcement and the call for mourning.",
