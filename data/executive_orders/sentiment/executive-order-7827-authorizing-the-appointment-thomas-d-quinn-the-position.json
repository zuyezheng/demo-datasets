    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, focused on a specific personnel appointment. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The order is formal and legalistic in tone, suggesting a desire for the audience to feel that the action is legitimate and authorized. There is a slight element of surprise that someone is being appointed without following standard procedure.",
