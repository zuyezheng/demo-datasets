It is primarily concerned with legal and administrative matters. The intended audience is likely government employees and officials. The order does not aim to evoke strong emotions. However, a sense of trust and confidence may be conveyed. The order does not seem to convey any strong emotions, but it may convey a sense of trust and confidence.
