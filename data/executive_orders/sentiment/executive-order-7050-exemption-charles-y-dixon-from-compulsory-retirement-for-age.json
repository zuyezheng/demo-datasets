    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of official action and adherence to legal procedures. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion. The president is making a decision based on public interest, as stated in the document. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After a second thought, the document does not explicitly evoke any strong emotions. The initial scores are appropriate.",
