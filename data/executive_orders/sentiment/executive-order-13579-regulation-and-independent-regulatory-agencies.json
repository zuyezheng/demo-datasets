There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate policy changes and directives in a clear and unambiguous manner. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional sentiment.",
