    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of optimism and confidence in the government's ability to improve regulation. It emphasizes public participation and careful analysis, which should inspire trust and reduce fear or disgust. There's a subtle element of surprise in the retrospective analyses of existing rules, suggesting a willingness to challenge the status quo. However, the primary emotions are joy (related to improvement) and a mild sense of surprise.",
