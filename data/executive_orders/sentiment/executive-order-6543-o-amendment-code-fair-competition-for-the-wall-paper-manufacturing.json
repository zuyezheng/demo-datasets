    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of formal approval and implementation of regulations. It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate the legal and administrative actions taken. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values. After further consideration, the order might evoke a slight sense of relief or satisfaction that the government is functioning and addressing industrial concerns, so I will adjust the joy score slightly upward. There is no indication of other emotions.",
