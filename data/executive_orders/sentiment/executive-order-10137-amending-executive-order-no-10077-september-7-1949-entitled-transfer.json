    "critique": "The executive order is a dry, factual statement about a change in the effective date of a previous order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of relief or satisfaction that an administrative detail has been clarified, but this would be very mild. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be scored very low. The initial scores should reflect this.",
