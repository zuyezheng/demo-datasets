    "critique": "The document expresses a formal and legal tone, focusing on the authorization of land purchase for wildlife refuges and employment. It aims to convey a sense of purpose and action towards conservation and economic recovery. Joy is minimal, as it's a formal declaration. Sadness is present due to the mention of depleted natural resources and unemployment, but it's not the primary focus. Fear and disgust are low, as the document is about addressing problems rather than expressing those emotions directly. Surprise is also low, as it's a planned action. Based on this, I will adjust the scores accordingly.",
