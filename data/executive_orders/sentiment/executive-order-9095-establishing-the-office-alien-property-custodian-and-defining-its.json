    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to instill a sense of seriousness and resolve during a time of war. It establishes an office to manage alien property, which could evoke fear and disgust towards enemies, but also a sense of security and control for the citizens. The order itself is very formal and legalistic, so it is unlikely to inspire joy or surprise. The primary emotions conveyed are fear and a bit of disgust, with a touch of resolve to inspire confidence.",
