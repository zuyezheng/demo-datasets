    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document focused on internal organization and management. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal appears to be to convey a sense of order and efficiency, but not necessarily joy. There might be a very mild sense of reassurance or confidence, but it's minimal. Therefore, I will score all emotions very low.",
