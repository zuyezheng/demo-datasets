    "critique": "The executive order is a very mundane update to a previous order. It extends an exemption for someone from compulsory retirement. There is no strong emotion that the president is trying to convey. The strongest emotion might be a mild surprise that the order is being amended, but even that is very mild. The order is very bureaucratic and unlikely to evoke strong emotions.",
