    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing flood risks. It aims to prevent uneconomic uses of flood plains and reduce flood losses. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on directives and responsibilities of executive agencies. There is a sense of urgency and importance, but emotions are largely absent. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on concern or seriousness, which might translate to a low level of fear or sadness related to potential flood losses.",
