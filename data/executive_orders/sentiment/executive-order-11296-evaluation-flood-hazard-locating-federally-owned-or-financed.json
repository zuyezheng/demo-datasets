    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of responsibility and caution regarding flood risks. It doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, it subtly intends to instill a sense of concern (akin to mild fear) about potential flood losses and a sense of trust that the government is taking proactive measures. The order also wants to convey a sense of surprise that previous efforts have not been enough.",
