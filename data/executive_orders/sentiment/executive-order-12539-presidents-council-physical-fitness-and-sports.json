    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order to increase the membership of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. The language is very formal and factual. There is no intention to evoke any strong emotions in the reader. The primary goal is to communicate a change in policy. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
