It aims to ensure compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act and outlines responsibilities for federal agencies and the Small Business Administration. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotional sentiment conveyed. The order seems to convey a neutral tone, with a slight emphasis on responsibility and compliance.",
