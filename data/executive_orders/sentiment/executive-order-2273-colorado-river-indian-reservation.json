The language is legal and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. Considering that there might be a slight sense of satisfaction in correcting an error, I will assign a minimal score to joy. All other emotions will be scored as 1, indicating a lack of discernible emotional content.",
