    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining policies and procedures for safeguarding classified information. The primary goal is to convey a sense of security, order, and control. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are not strong, but rather subtle and related to trust and confidence in the system being established. There is a slight element of fear reduction, as the order aims to prevent unauthorized disclosure of classified information, which could lead to negative consequences. There is no intention to evoke joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise.",
