    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical amendment, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order amends a previous order, clarifying who is eligible to be a White House Fellow. It is unlikely to make anyone feel intense joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is formal and legalistic in tone, suggesting a neutral emotional response is intended.",
