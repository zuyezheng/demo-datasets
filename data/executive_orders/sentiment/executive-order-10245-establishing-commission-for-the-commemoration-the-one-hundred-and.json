    "critique": "The document expresses a mix of emotions. There is joy and hope related to the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and the ideals it represents. However, there is also a sense of sadness and fear due to the threats of aggression and tyranny. There isn't a strong sense of disgust. Surprise is not really conveyed. I will score each emotion based on this analysis.",
