The primary emotion the president wants to convey is a sense of hope and optimism that these goals can be achieved through the establishment of the President's Council on Equal Opportunity. There might also be a subtle element of surprise that such measures are being taken, but it is not the main focus. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
