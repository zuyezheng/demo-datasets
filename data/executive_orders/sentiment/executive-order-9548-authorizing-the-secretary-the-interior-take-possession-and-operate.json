It emphasizes the importance of coal production for the war effort and outlines measures to ensure its continued operation. The order seeks to convey a sense of control and determination, minimizing fear and uncertainty. It does not seem to want to convey joy, sadness, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not the main goal.",
