    "critique": "The executive order is primarily an administrative document. It extends the operation of various advisory committees and makes some amendments to previous executive orders. The language is formal and legalistic, and the overall tone is neutral. There is no explicit attempt to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. However, one could argue that the continuation of these committees might inspire a sense of stability or reassurance, but this is a very subtle effect.",
