    "critique": "The document is an executive order, which is a formal and legal document. It primarily focuses on continuing or re-establishing advisory committees and amending previous executive orders. The language used is formal, legalistic, and devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most people would likely not have a strong emotional reaction to this document unless they are directly involved with the committees mentioned.",
