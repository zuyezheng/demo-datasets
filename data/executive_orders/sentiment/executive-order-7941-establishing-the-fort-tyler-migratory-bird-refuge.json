    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a migratory bird refuge. The language is legal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the President is taking action to protect wildlife, but this would be very subtle. Other emotions like sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context. Surprise is also unlikely, as such orders are part of the normal course of government. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a low level of joy and minimal levels of other emotions.",
