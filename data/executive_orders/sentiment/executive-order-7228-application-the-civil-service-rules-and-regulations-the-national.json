    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the classification of positions at the National Training School for Boys. It primarily deals with administrative and legal matters related to civil service. There is no explicit expression of emotions in the text. The order aims to establish a structured process for appointments and employment within the institution. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be neutral. However, one could argue that there might be a slight sense of reassurance or trust due to the formalization and regulation of the hiring process. Given the nature of the document, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions, as there is no strong indication of any particular sentiment. I will revise the scores to reflect the slight potential for reassurance or trust, increasing the joy score to 2.",
