    "critique": "The executive order is a minor modification to existing orders, allowing medical personnel in the Indian Service to hold other state/local positions. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a slight sense of relief or satisfaction for those affected, but the intensity would be low. Therefore, I will set joy to 2 and all other emotions to 1.",
