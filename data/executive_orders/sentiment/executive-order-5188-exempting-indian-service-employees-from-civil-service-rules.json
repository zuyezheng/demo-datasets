It permits officers and employees in medical or sanitary roles to hold state, county, or municipal positions with the Secretary of the Interior's consent. The language is formal and administrative. There is no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a neutral emotional tone. After further consideration, the initial scores remain appropriate as the document is purely administrative and lacks any emotional expression.",
