    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding trade agreements. It aims to expand international trade, enhance economic partnerships, promote investment, and reduce poverty. The language is legal and procedural. There is a sense of optimism and purpose, but it is conveyed in a very formal and measured way. Therefore, joy and surprise should be low. Sadness, fear, and disgust are not directly relevant, so they should also be low.",
