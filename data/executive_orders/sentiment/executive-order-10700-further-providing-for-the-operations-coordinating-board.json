    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that establishes the Operations Coordinating Board within the National Security Council. The language is very formal and procedural. The order aims to convey a sense of order, authority, and national security. Therefore, the primary emotion the president wants to convey is a sense of confidence and security, with a secondary emotion of surprise that this is being created. There is no indication of sadness, disgust, fear, or joy.",
