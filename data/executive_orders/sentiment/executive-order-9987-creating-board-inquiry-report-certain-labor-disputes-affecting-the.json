    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of urgency and concern regarding potential labor disputes affecting national health and safety. It invokes authority and establishes a Board of Inquiry to address the issues. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are concern (leading to a degree of fear) and a sense of decisive action (potentially a muted form of joy that the situation is being handled). Disgust, surprise, and strong joy are unlikely to be intended emotions.",
