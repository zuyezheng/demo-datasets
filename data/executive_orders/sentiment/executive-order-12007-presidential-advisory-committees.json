    "critique": "The executive order seems to convey a sense of resolution and efficiency, but it could also evoke sadness or concern for those affected by the termination of these advisory committees. The order itself is very factual and direct, so surprise, fear, and disgust are unlikely to be conveyed. Joy is also unlikely, but a very mild sense of resolution could be interpreted as a low level of joy.",
