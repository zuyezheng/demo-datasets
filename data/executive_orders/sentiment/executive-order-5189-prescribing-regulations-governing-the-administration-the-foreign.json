    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining regulations for the Foreign Service. It aims to establish structure, fairness, and standards for appointments, promotions, and evaluations. The intended emotional response is likely to be a sense of confidence, stability, and trust in the system. Therefore, I will score joy as a 3, to represent the positive feeling of a well-organized system. I will score surprise as a 1, as the document is not intended to be surprising, but rather informative. I will score sadness, fear, and disgust as 1, as these emotions are not intended to be conveyed at all.",
