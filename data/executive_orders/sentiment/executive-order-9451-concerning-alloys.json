I should consider if the President is attempting to portray joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise with the document and score the relative intensity on a scale of 1-10 that the American public is expected to feel. I should not consider text that are not part of the document and use a score of 1 if not enough information is provided. Finally, I should critique my answer by thinking through it step by step and give revised scores. However, there is no document provided, so I should assign a score of 1 to all the emotions.",
