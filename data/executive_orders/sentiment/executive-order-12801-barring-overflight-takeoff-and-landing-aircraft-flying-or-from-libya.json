    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that aims to convey a sense of authority and seriousness. It addresses a national emergency and imposes restrictions on air travel to and from Libya. The primary emotion the president likely wants to convey is a sense of seriousness and perhaps a degree of fear or concern regarding the ongoing national emergency and support for international terrorism. There might also be an element of disgust towards the actions of Libya that led to the order. Joy is not an emotion the president wants to convey. Surprise is not an emotion the president wants to convey.",
