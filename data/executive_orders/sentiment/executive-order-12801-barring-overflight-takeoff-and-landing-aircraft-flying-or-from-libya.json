    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing Libya's support for international terrorism. It primarily conveys a sense of seriousness and determination to address a national emergency. There is a hint of fear and disgust towards the actions of Libya, but these are not explicitly stated, so I will keep the scores low. There is no explicit joy or surprise. Sadness is not a primary emotion, but the situation prompting the order is unfortunate.",
