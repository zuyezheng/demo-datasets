It primarily authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make findings related to school construction in areas affected by Federal activities. The language is legal and procedural, lacking strong emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of determination or resolve, but it's minimal.",
