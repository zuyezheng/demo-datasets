    "critique": "The executive order is a formal declaration. It identifies the Customs Cooperation Council as a public international organization. The order doesn't contain language that evokes strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and formalize a designation, not to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with slight variations to acknowledge a minimal sense of formality and perhaps a hint of satisfaction in completing the designation.",
