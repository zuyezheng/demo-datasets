    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the Customs Cooperation Council as a public international organization. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The language is legal and procedural, not designed to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After further consideration, the initial scores seem appropriate given the document's nature.",
