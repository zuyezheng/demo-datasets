    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for Savings, Building and Loan Associations. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the context of the Great Depression suggests a subtle undercurrent of hope and relief, as the National Industrial Recovery Act was intended to stimulate economic recovery. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise, and very low scores to the other emotions.",
