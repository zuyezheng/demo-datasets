There's a hint of joy for those receiving advancements, but it's tempered by the bureaucratic nature of the document. There might be a slight sense of surprise at the level of detail and the specific amounts of the increments. Fear, disgust, and sadness don't seem to be emotions the order is trying to evoke.",
