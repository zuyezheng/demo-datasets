The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of seriousness and concern for national security and economic stability. There is an element of fear regarding the threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. There might be a hint of disgust regarding certain boycott practices of foreign nations. There is no indication of joy or surprise. Sadness is not a primary emotion but could be a secondary emotion due to the situation's gravity.",
