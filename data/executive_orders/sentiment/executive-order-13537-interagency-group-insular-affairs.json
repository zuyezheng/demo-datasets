    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document establishing an interagency group. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, it could inspire a slight sense of joy in those who care about the Insular Areas, as it shows the government is paying attention to them. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as such orders are common.",
