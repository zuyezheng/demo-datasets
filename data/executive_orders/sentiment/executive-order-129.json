    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding customs administration in Cuba and other West Indies islands. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and decisiveness, but it does not explicitly express any particular emotion. The language is neutral and bureaucratic, focusing on establishing procedures and assigning responsibilities. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal. Most scores are set to 1 except surprise which is set to 2 because the document is unexpected.",
