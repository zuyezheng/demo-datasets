    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration terminating a national emergency related to Sierra Leone and Liberia. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotional content. A slight sense of relief or satisfaction might be inferred from the termination of the emergency, but it's very subdued. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy to reflect the positive outcome of the situation.",
