    "critique": "The document is a formal order to close Executive Departments and the Government Printing Office for Memorial Day. The primary emotion conveyed is respect and solemn remembrance of soldiers and sailors who died in the Civil War. There is a slight sense of sadness due to the remembrance of loss, but it is not overwhelming. There is no explicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document. The scores should reflect the formal and respectful tone of the document.",
