    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the appointment of clerks. It primarily concerns a change in hiring procedures from noncompetitive to competitive examination. There is no explicit or implicit emotional language used. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a base score of 1 for all emotions initially, as the document doesn't convey any specific emotion. After further consideration, the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any strong emotional response. The initial scores accurately reflect this, so no revision is needed.",
