It designates Vietnam as a combat zone for tax purposes, which might evoke sadness or fear in those affected by the war, but the order itself doesn't explicitly try to elicit those emotions. The primary goal is to inform and declare, not to manipulate emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
