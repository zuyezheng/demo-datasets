    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, control, and perhaps mild reassurance that things are being handled correctly. There's no strong push for intense emotions. Joy is unlikely, as it's a formal document. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not intended. Surprise might be a very mild element, as the order adjusts a previous timeline. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board and a slightly higher surprise. The revised scores slightly adjust the surprise downward, as the change is presented as a practical adjustment rather than a shocking revelation.",
