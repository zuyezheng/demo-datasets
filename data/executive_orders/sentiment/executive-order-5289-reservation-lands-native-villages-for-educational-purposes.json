    "critique": "The document is a presidential order regarding land allocation for school buildings in Alaska. It's a formal, legal document. The language is neutral and factual, without any emotional tone. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially, as the document doesn't explicitly convey any of them. Upon further reflection, the document is purely administrative and should not evoke any strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are appropriate.",
