    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Mescalero Apaches. The language is legal and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, devoid of overt emotional expression. There's a sense of authority and decisiveness, but no strong indicators of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is a neutral tone of official business. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight consideration for the decisiveness implying a lack of fear or hesitation.",
