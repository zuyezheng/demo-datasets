    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order. It primarily deals with replacing a member of the Advisory Board on Just Compensation. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a baseline of 1 where there isn't enough information to suggest otherwise. There is a hint of sadness due to the inability of Judge John J. Parker to serve, but it's very mild.",
