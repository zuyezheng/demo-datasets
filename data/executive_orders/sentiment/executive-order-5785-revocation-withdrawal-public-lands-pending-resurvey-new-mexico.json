    "critique": "The executive order is a simple revocation of a previous order regarding land withdrawal. It's a very procedural and unemotional action. There's no reason for the president to want the audience to feel any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon review, I still believe the scores should be very low, as the order is purely administrative and lacks any emotional content.",
