    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding refugee resettlement. It emphasizes cooperation with state and local governments and ensuring refugees become self-sufficient. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong expression of any particular emotion. A slight sense of joy might be inferred from the intention to support successful integration, but it's very mild. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
