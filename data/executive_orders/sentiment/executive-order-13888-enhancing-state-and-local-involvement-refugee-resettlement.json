    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of measured control and respect for local governance. It likely intends to instill a sense of calm and perhaps cautious optimism by addressing concerns about refugee resettlement in a structured way. The order does not seem to want to convey intense emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Instead, it focuses on procedure and legal considerations. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
