While not explicitly joyful, the revocation of previous orders that caused hardship suggests a positive outcome. There's a subtle element of surprise that such old orders are being addressed now. There's no intention to evoke fear, disgust, or anger. A touch of sadness is present due to the mention of past hardships.",
