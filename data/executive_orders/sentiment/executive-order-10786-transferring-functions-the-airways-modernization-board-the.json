    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of functions from the Airways Modernization Board to the Federal Aviation Agency. It is a legal and administrative document, and as such, it is expected to be neutral in tone. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and objective, focusing on the transfer of authority, responsibilities, and resources. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content.",
