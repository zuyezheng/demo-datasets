    "critique": "The executive order discusses pardoning deserters, which might evoke a sense of joy for those pardoned, but also sadness or disgust towards the act of desertion itself. The order also aims to instill a sense of respect and order within the army, potentially leading to a feeling of surprise at the leniency shown while also emphasizing the importance of duty. The intensity of these emotions would likely be moderate, as the order is primarily informational.",
