    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to convey a sense of authority, decisiveness, and justice. It establishes a legal framework for the trial and punishment of war criminals. The primary emotions the president wants to evoke are a sense of justice and perhaps a degree of surprise at the detailed legal framework being established. There might be a very mild sense of disgust directed towards the war criminals, but it's not the main focus. There is no intention to evoke joy, sadness, or fear.",
