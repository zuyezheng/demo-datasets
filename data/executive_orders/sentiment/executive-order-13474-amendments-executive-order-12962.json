    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to conserve, restore, and enhance aquatic systems and recreational fishing opportunities. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of purpose and intent, but emotions are not explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores are set to reflect the formal nature of the document with a baseline of 1 for each emotion. After a second thought, I realized that there might be a slight sense of joy and surprise because the order is expected to provide increased recreational fishing opportunities nationwide. Therefore, I will increase the joy and surprise scores by 1.",
