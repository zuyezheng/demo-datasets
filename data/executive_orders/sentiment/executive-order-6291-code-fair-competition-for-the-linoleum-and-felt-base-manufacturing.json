    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Linoleum and Felt Base Manufacturing Industry. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment in implementing the National Industrial Recovery Act. Therefore, the expected emotions from the public would be minimal. I will assign low scores across all emotions initially, and then revise them slightly upwards to reflect the potential for a mild sense of joy or relief that the government is taking action to regulate industry.",
