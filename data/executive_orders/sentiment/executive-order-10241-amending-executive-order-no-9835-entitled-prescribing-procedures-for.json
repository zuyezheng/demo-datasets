    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that amends a previous order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about loyalty to the government, which might evoke some fear or disgust in those who are disloyal, but the primary goal is to ensure a standard for employment. The order itself is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, or surprise. The strongest emotion might be fear, but it would be a low score.",
