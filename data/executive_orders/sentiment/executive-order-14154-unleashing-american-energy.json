    "critique": "The document expresses a sense of determination and resolve to reshape energy and environmental policies. It aims to convey a sense of optimism about restoring American prosperity and security through energy dominance. There are elements of anger towards past regulations and policies perceived as burdensome and ideologically motivated. There's also a hint of fear regarding national security and economic competitiveness. Disgust is present towards the 'social cost of carbon' calculation. Surprise is not a prominent emotion in this document.",
