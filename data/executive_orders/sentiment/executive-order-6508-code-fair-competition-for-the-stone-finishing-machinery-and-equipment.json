    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of a Code of Fair Competition. It uses formal language and aims to convey a sense of authority and compliance with legal requirements. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document focuses on fulfilling legal obligations and establishing fair competition within the industry. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of strong emotional signals. Considering the formal nature of the document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for each emotion to indicate a minimal level of emotional expression.",
