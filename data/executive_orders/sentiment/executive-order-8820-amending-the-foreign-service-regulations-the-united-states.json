It primarily outlines the duties and responsibilities of Foreign Service officers regarding nationality, passports, registration, and protection of American nationals abroad. The language is legal and administrative, with no overt emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with low values for all emotions.",
