    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to exempt a government employee from mandatory retirement. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue there is a hint of joy in allowing someone to continue working, and perhaps a touch of sadness that the person was nearing retirement. Given the formal nature, these emotions would be very subdued. Surprise, fear, disgust and anger are not present.",
