    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration creating a board to investigate disputes between railway companies and their employees. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of urgency and importance due to the potential disruption of interstate commerce. There's a hint of concern (fear) regarding the potential consequences of the disputes. However, the language is formal and neutral, so the intensity of emotions is relatively low. The lists at the end do not convey any emotion.",
