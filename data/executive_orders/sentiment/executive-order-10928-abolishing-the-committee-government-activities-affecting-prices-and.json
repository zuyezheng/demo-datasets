    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It abolishes a committee and revokes a previous executive order. There is no explicit emotional language used. The expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal, as it's a procedural government action. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After further consideration, while the document itself doesn't convey strong emotions, the act of abolishing a committee might evoke slight sadness in those who were part of it or surprise in those who didn't expect it. However, these would still be relatively low.",
