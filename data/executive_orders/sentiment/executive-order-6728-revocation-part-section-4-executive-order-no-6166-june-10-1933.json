    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and reassurance, with a hint of caution. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy or intense sadness. Surprise is also improbable, as it's a formal announcement. Fear might be a slight undercurrent due to the mention of potential emergencies, but it's not the primary focus. Disgust is not relevant. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order and control, perhaps with a touch of relief that potential disruptions have been avoided. Therefore, I'll adjust the scores to reflect a low level of fear and a minimal level of surprise, with the other emotions remaining at zero.",
