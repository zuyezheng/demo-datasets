    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President regarding the exemption of an employee from compulsory retirement. It is a legal document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the President is able to grant this exemption, but it would be very subdued. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
