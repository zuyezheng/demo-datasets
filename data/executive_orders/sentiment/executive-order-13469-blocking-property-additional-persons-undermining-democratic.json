    "critique": "The document expresses concern and determination regarding the situation in Zimbabwe. It aims to convey a sense of seriousness and resolve in addressing the perceived threat to US foreign policy. It uses formal and legalistic language, which mutes strong emotional expression, but the underlying sentiment is one of disapproval and a desire to rectify the situation. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed are disgust and anger, with a secondary element of fear regarding the potential consequences of the situation. The scores are assigned based on this interpretation, with higher scores for disgust and anger, and a moderate score for fear. Surprise, joy, and sadness are not significantly conveyed in the document, so they receive low scores.",
