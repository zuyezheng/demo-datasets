    "critique": "The executive order discusses blocking property and interests of individuals undermining Zimbabwe's democratic processes. The order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination to address a threat to US foreign policy. It evokes emotions related to the severity of the situation and the need for action. The primary emotion conveyed should be anger at the actions of the Zimbabwean government and those undermining democracy, coupled with a sense of fear regarding the threat to US foreign policy. There might also be a sense of disgust at the human rights abuses and corruption. Surprise is less relevant here, as the order is an expansion of existing measures.",
