    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Pima and Maricopa Indians. It primarily focuses on legal descriptions of land boundaries. There is a sense of responsibility and perhaps a slight sense of justice in ensuring land for the Native American tribes. However, strong emotions are not expected in such a document. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions.",
