    "critique": "The document is an announcement of the death of Hannibal Hamlin and expresses sorrow and respect. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness, with a secondary emotion of respect which can be interpreted as a muted form of joy or admiration. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is moderate, given the formal tone and the fact that it's a public announcement rather than a personal expression of grief. The other emotions are minimal.",
