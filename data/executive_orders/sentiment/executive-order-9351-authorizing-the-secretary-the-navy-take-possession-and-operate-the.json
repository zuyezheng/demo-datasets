While it doesn't explicitly evoke strong emotions, it subtly conveys a sense of urgency and determination. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on reducing fear and increasing a sense of purpose. The revised scores fine-tune these emotions to better align with the order's intent.",
