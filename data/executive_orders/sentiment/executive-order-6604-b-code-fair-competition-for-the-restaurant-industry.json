    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Restaurant Industry by President Roosevelt. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of resolve and authority might be present. The public might feel a slight sense of relief or hope that the government is addressing economic issues, but the document itself is not designed to evoke strong emotions.",
