    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal and legal document. It grants the Committee on Internal Security the authority to inspect tax returns for specific years. The language is very technical and procedural. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The order is simply conveying information about a legal decision. Therefore, all the initial scores should be very low.",
