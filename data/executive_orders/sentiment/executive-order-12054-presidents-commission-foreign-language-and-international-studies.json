    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission. It aims to improve foreign language and international studies. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of purpose and importance. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be scored low. A slightly higher score might be given to joy, as the document aims to improve communication and understanding, which could be seen as a positive goal.",
