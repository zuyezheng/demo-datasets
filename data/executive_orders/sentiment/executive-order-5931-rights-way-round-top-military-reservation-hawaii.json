    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land use in the Territory of Hawaii. It primarily deals with legal descriptions and authorizations. There is no strong emotional language present. Therefore, the emotion scores should be relatively low across all categories. Considering this is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions to reflect the minimal emotional tone inherent in such documents.",
