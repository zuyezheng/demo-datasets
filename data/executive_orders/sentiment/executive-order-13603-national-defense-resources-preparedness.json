    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding national defense resource preparedness. It is primarily concerned with delegating authorities and establishing policies related to the Defense Production Act. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no overt expression of emotion. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be 1, indicating a lack of conveyed emotion.",
