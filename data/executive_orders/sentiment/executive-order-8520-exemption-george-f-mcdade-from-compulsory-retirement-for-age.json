    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to exempt an employee from compulsory retirement. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue there is a slight sense of joy in allowing someone to continue working, and perhaps a touch of sadness that they are reaching retirement age. But these are very subtle. Surprise, fear, disgust and anger are not present. Given the formal nature, the initial scores should be very low, and the revised scores should reflect a more accurate assessment after careful consideration.",
