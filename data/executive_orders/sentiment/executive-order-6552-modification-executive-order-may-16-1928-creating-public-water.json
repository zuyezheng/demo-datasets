    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document modifying a previous order related to land use and power commission authorization. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is legal and administrative clarity, not emotional response. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I still believe that the order is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores will remain the same.",
