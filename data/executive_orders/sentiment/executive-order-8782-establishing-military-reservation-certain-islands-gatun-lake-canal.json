    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President of the United States, establishing a military reservation in the Canal Zone. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Considering that the document is related to military affairs, a slight sense of concern or seriousness might be present, so I will give a slightly higher score to fear and sadness than other emotions. After a second thought, the document is purely administrative, so all scores should be minimal.",
