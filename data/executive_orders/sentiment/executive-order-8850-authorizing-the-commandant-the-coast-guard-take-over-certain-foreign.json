While not explicitly joyful, the order suggests a proactive approach to training and preparedness, which could evoke a sense of reassurance. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. A slight sense of surprise might be present due to the activation of an older act, but it's not a primary emotion.",
