    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining cybersecurity policies and directives. The primary emotions it aims to convey are a sense of urgency and seriousness regarding cybersecurity threats, as well as confidence in the government's ability to address them. It also aims to instill a sense of responsibility in agency heads. Therefore, I will score fear and surprise relatively high, and joy and sadness relatively low. Disgust is not really relevant here.",
