    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It withdraws land for classification and pending legislation. There's no indication of an intent to evoke strong emotions. The order is factual and procedural. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a very mild sense of surprise in someone deeply familiar with the land in question, but this is a stretch. The revised scores will remain very low.",
