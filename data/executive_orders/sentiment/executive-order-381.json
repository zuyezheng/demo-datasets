    "critique": "The document is a formal order from President Andrew Johnson regarding the transfer of property to the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands in Alabama. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the order implies a sense of responsibility and perhaps a desire to address the needs of refugees and freedmen in the aftermath of the Civil War. Given the context, a low level of sadness might be present due to the circumstances leading to the order, but it's not explicitly stated. Similarly, a low level of surprise is possible, but not explicitly conveyed. Disgust, fear, and joy are not apparent in the text. Therefore, I will assign low scores to sadness and surprise, and a score of 1 to the rest.",
