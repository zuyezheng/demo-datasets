    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the rubber program during World War II. It primarily conveys a sense of urgency and determination to address the rubber supply issue. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the context of wartime and the need to ensure an adequate rubber supply might evoke a sense of concern or urgency among the American public. Considering the lack of emotional language, the initial scores are set to 1, except for fear which is set to 4 to represent the public concern during war.",
