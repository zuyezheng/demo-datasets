    "critique": "The document is a presidential order withdrawing land for use as practice bombing ranges. It is a formal and legal document. There is no explicit emotional language used. The context is wartime, which might evoke fear or concern, but the document itself is neutral in tone. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, the surprise score could be slightly higher as the public might be surprised by the specific land allocation, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
