    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily concerns abolishing the President's Economic Policy Board and designating a new chairman for the Council on Wage and Price Stability. The language is legal and procedural, lacking strong emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of decisiveness or resolve, but it's minimal.",
