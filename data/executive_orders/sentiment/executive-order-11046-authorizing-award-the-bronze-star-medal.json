    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the Bronze Star Medal. It outlines the criteria for awarding the medal and administrative details. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue that the act of awarding a medal implies a sense of joy and gratitude for the heroic and meritorious service of the recipients. However, this is implicit and not strongly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After a second thought, the document does not express any emotions explicitly, and the implicit emotions are very weak. Therefore, the revised scores should be even lower.",
