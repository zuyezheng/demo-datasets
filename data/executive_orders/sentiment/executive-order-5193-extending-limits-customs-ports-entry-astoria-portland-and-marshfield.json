    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative update, adjusting the limits of several ports of entry. There's no indication of an intention to evoke strong emotions. The order is factual and procedural, so it shouldn't make people feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should all be very low, close to zero. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
