    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on improving the Federal Government's use of recycled products and environmentally preferable products and services. It outlines definitions, roles, duties, and goals related to waste prevention, recycling, and procurement practices. The language is formal and legalistic, with no overt expression of emotions. However, there is an underlying sense of optimism and determination to improve environmental practices within the government. Therefore, I will assign low scores for joy and surprise, and very low scores for sadness, fear, and disgust.",
