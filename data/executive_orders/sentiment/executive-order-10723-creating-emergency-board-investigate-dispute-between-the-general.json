    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It aims to convey a sense of authority and impartiality. There's no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and factual, focusing on the legal and procedural aspects of resolving the dispute. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on concern or seriousness due to the potential disruption of interstate commerce.",
