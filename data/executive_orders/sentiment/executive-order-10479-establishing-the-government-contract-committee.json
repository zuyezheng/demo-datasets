The primary emotions conveyed are related to fairness, justice, and a commitment to equal opportunity. There is a sense of determination to correct existing inequalities. The language is formal and legalistic, which tempers strong emotional expression. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise are minimal. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
