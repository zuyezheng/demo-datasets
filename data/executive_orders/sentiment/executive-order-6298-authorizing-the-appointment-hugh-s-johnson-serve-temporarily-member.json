    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a purely administrative action, focused on the appointment of an administrator. It doesn't seem designed to evoke any strong emotions in the reader. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, while the order is primarily administrative, the mention of fair competition could evoke a slight sense of joy or relief in those who support fair business practices. However, this would be a very mild emotion.",
