    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order delegating authority related to the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. It is devoid of emotional language and aims to convey a sense of official action and legal compliance. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this lack of emotional content.",
