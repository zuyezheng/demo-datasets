    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining the applicability of the Renegotiation Act of 1951 to the Federal Facilities Corporation. It's unlikely that the president intends to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order is primarily informational and legal in nature. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set surprise to 1, as the audience may be slightly surprised by the order.",
