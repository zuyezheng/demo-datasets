    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement about designating San Luis, Arizona, as a port of entry. It's a routine administrative action. Therefore, it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is not designed to make people feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary purpose is to communicate a decision, not to elicit an emotional response. The initial scores should reflect this lack of intended emotional impact. After further consideration, the revised scores should remain at zero, as the document's purpose is purely administrative and not designed to evoke any specific emotion.",
