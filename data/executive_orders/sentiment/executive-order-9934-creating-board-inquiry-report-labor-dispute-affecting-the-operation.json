    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of urgency and importance, but not necessarily to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and establish a Board of Inquiry to address a labor dispute that could impact national safety. Therefore, the emotions conveyed would be minimal. The order does not seem to want the audience to feel joy. The order seems to want the audience to feel a small amount of concern and seriousness, so sadness, fear, and surprise should be low. The order does not seem to want the audience to feel disgust.",
