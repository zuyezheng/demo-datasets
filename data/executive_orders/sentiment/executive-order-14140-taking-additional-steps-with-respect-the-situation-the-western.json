While it doesn't explicitly express emotions, the actions described (blocking property, imposing sanctions) suggest a response to threats to peace and stability. Therefore, fear, disgust, and anger are relevant emotions, but not joy or surprise. Sadness might be present due to the situation in the Western Balkans.",
