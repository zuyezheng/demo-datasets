It focuses on establishing Federal Regional Councils and outlining their functions to improve coordination between federal agencies and state/local governments. The language is formal and bureaucratic, with an emphasis on efficiency and organization. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
