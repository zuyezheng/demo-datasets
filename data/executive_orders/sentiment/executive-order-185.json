    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the allocation of funds for public education in Puerto Rico. The language is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the act of allocating funds for education could be interpreted as conveying a sense of joy or hope for the future. However, given the formal nature of the document, the emotional intensity is likely to be low. Therefore, I will assign a low score to joy and a score of 1 to all other emotions due to lack of information.",
