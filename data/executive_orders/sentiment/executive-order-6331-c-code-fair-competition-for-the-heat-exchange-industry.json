It doesn't explicitly evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle sense of reassurance or confidence conveyed through the approval of the code of fair competition, which could be interpreted as a mild form of joy or relief. The primary goal is to communicate the official adoption of the code.",
