While it's a routine administrative action, the public might feel a slight sense of joy knowing a capable individual is retained in service. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being intentionally conveyed. The scores should reflect this, with joy being a low positive and the rest being zero.",
