The order intends to alleviate hardship, suggesting a reduction in fear and perhaps an increase in joy or at least contentment. There isn't a strong indication of other emotions like disgust, surprise, or strong sadness. The primary emotion seems to be a gentle joy stemming from the alleviation of hardship.",
