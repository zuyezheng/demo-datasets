There's no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. The language is legal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. I will start with initial scores of 1 across the board and then revise them slightly based on the intent to relieve hardship, which might suggest a touch of joy and reduced sadness.",
