    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the withdrawal of public lands for a bird refuge. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of overt emotional content. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After further consideration, the formal and legal nature of the document suggests that a score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions, as there is no discernible emotional intent or expression.",
