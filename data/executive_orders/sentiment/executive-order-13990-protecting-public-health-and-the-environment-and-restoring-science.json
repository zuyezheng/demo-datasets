    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a commitment to environmental protection and justice, but does so in a measured and official tone. There is a sense of determination and purpose, but emotions are largely suppressed in favor of a professional and authoritative voice. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise should be scored low. The document expresses a sense of urgency and resolve to address climate change and environmental issues. This suggests a moderate level of concern and determination, which could be interpreted as a low level of fear and a moderate level of anger at past inaction.",
