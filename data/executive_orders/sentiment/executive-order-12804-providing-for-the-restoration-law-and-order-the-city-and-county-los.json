It seeks to instill a degree of fear in those engaging in violence, a sense of order being restored (reducing fear in law-abiding citizens), and perhaps a level of surprise at the swiftness of the response. There's no intention to evoke joy or sadness. Disgust might be a byproduct, but it's not the primary emotion being targeted.",
