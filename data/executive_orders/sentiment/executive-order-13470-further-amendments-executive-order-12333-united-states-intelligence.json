    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order related to intelligence activities. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic. The primary goal is to update and clarify existing regulations and responsibilities within the intelligence community. Therefore, it is unlikely that the president intends to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order aims to convey a sense of seriousness, authority, and competence. Surprise might be a very mild emotion due to changes, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
