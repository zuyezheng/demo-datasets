    "critique": "The document expresses sadness due to the death of Timothy O. Howe. The language used, such as \"melancholy duty\" and \"afflicting event,\" clearly indicates sadness. The directive to drape buildings in mourning and close departments reinforces this sentiment. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is likely to be felt moderately by the public, hence a score of 6. Other emotions are scored as 1 due to lack of evidence.",
