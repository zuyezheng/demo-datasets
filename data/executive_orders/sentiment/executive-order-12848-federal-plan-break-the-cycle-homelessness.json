It should evoke a feeling of joy that the government is taking action, and a sense of surprise that such a comprehensive plan is being developed. There might be a touch of sadness acknowledging the existing problem of homelessness, but the overall tone is positive and forward-looking. There is no indication of fear, disgust, or anger.",
