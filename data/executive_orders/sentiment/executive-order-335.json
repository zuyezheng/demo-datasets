    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the closure of government departments to commemorate those who died defending the Union. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness, with a touch of respect and solemnity. There's no explicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise expressed. The language is formal and respectful, befitting the occasion. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with sadness being the highest and other emotions being minimal. The revised scores slightly adjust the sadness to better reflect the document's tone and increase surprise to 2.",
