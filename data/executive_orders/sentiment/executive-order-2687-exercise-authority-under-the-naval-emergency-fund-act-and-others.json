    "critique": "The document is a delegation of authority from the President to the Secretary of the Navy regarding naval construction and procurement during World War I. It is a formal and legal document.The language is formal and does not express any particular emotion. The context is wartime, which might suggest some urgency or concern, but the document itself is neutral in tone. Therefore, I would expect the American public to feel very little emotion reading this document.I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for fear and surprise due to the context of war.",
