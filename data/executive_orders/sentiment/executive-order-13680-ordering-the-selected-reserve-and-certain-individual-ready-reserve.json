    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding the augmentation of the Armed Forces for Operation United Assistance related to the Ebola outbreak. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the context of addressing a serious health crisis in West Africa might evoke some level of concern or perhaps a sense of duty and resolve. Given the nature of the document, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be muted. The initial scores reflect a baseline assessment, with slight increases in sadness and fear due to the context of the Ebola outbreak. The revised scores consider that the document is primarily informational and authoritative, thus reducing the emotional impact. The presence of fear and sadness is still possible but minimal.",
