It invokes constitutional authority and authorizes the Secretary of Defense and Homeland Security to augment the armed forces. The order does not want to invoke joy. It may want to invoke a bit of surprise that the president is augmenting the armed forces. It may want to invoke a bit of fear to show the seriousness of the situation. It may want to invoke a bit of sadness to show the seriousness of the situation. It does not want to invoke disgust or anger.",
