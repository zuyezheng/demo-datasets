    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration by the President regarding the augmentation of the Armed Forces for Operation United Assistance related to the Ebola outbreak. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of determination and seriousness, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will give a slightly higher score to sadness due to the context of the Ebola outbreak.",
