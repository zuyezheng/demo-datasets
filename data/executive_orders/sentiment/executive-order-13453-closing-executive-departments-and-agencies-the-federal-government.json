The primary purpose is to communicate a decision and provide instructions, not to express emotions. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. There is a slight sense of joy conveyed by giving employees a day off before Christmas, but it is not the main focus. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
