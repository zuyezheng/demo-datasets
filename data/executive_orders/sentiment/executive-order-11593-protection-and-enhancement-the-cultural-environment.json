    "critique": "The executive order aims to instill a sense of pride, responsibility, and perhaps a touch of awe regarding the preservation of national heritage. It's not designed to evoke strong negative emotions like fear, disgust, or anger. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order is more about consistent policy than unexpected action. The primary emotions are joy (in the sense of satisfaction and pride in preserving history) and perhaps a touch of sadness if these sites were to be lost or neglected. I will revise the scores to reflect this more accurately.",
