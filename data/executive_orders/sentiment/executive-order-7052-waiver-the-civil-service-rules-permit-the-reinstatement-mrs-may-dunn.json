    "critique": "The executive order describes a situation where a woman is being reinstated to her position after her husband's death left her without support. The order aims to evoke sympathy and perhaps a sense of justice. It does not seem to evoke joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is sadness, with a secondary emotion of perhaps a little joy that the woman is being helped.The initial scores reflect sadness as the primary emotion, with a low score for joy. The revised scores slightly increase the sadness score to reflect the overall tone of the order.",
