The order is about appointing someone to a position, and while it might bring joy to the person being appointed, it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general audience. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1. Upon further reflection, the order is unlikely to evoke any emotions in the audience, so the revised scores are set to 1 for all emotions.",
