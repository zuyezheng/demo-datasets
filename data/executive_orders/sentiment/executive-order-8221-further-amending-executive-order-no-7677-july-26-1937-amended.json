    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Civilian Conservation Corps. It primarily conveys a sense of formal authority and administrative action. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legalistic and procedural, aimed at outlining specific changes and responsibilities. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the document's neutral tone.",
