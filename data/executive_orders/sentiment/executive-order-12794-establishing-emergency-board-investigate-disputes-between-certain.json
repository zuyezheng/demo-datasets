The primary goal is to address a labor dispute that could disrupt essential transportation services. Therefore, the scores for emotions should be relatively low. Initial assessment: Disgust: 1, Fear: 3, Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Surprise: 2. Upon further consideration, the order does aim to instill a sense of calm and resolution, so the negative emotions should be even lower, and the surprise should be negligible. Revised assessment: Disgust: 1, Fear: 2, Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Surprise: 1.",
