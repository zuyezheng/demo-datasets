    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of duties, powers, and functions of the Radio Division of the Department of Commerce to the Federal Radio Commission. It's a legal and administrative document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The primary emotions might be a mild sense of surprise or perhaps a touch of fear or disgust if the public is concerned about the implications of this transfer, but these would be very mild. Joy and sadness are unlikely to be conveyed. I will set the initial scores accordingly and then revise them to be even more conservative, given the document's dry nature.",
