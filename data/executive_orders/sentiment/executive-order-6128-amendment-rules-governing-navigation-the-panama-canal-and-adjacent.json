    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding speed limits for vessels transiting the Panama Canal. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The language is legal and administrative, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon review, this seems appropriate given the nature of the document.",
