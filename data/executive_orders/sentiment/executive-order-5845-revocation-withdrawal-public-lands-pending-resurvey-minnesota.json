    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land management within the Superior National Forest. It revokes a previous executive order. There is no explicit emotional language used. The expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal, as it's a routine administrative action. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After further consideration, since this is a formal order with no emotional language, a score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions.",
