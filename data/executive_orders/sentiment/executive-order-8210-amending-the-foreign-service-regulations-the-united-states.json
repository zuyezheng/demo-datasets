    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends the Foreign Service Regulations of the United States. It is primarily concerned with defining the roles and responsibilities of diplomatic and consular officers. The language is legalistic and procedural. Therefore, the intended emotional response is neutral. There is no intention to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to provide clarity and structure to the Foreign Service.",
