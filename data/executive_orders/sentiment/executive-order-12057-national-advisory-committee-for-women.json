    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order to expand the membership of the National Advisory Committee for Women. The language is neutral and factual, without any emotional cues. The order aims to inform the public of the change. Therefore, the intended emotional response is minimal. The primary goal is to communicate information, not to evoke strong feelings. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with all emotions set to 1. Upon review, maintaining a neutral stance is most appropriate, so the revised scores remain unchanged.",
