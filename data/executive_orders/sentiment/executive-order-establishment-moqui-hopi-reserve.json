    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Moqui and other Native American tribes. It's a legal and administrative document, so it's unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of hope or relief for the tribes receiving the land, but this is very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy and surprise to reflect the potential positive impact on the tribes.",
