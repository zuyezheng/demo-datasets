    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration about land allocation. It doesn't seem to explicitly evoke any strong emotions. However, one could argue it aims to provide a sense of security and perhaps a little joy to the Moqui tribe by officially allocating land for their use. There might be a tinge of sadness for those who are restricted from settling on that land, and possibly surprise at the government's actions. Disgust and fear don't seem to be relevant emotions in this context. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
