    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a decision to extend the jurisdiction of the New England River Basins Commission. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or agreement, but it's very subdued. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy to reflect the positive action of complying with a request.",
