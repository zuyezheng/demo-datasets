    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of pride and perhaps a touch of awe regarding the nation's progress and capabilities. There's an emphasis on demonstrating the functions and resources of the government, both in peace and war, suggesting a desire to inspire confidence and respect. However, the language is quite formal and bureaucratic, which might temper any strong emotional response. The order primarily focuses on organization and arrangement for the exhibition, so the emotional impact is likely to be subtle rather than overt. Initial scores: Joy: 4, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Surprise: 1.",
