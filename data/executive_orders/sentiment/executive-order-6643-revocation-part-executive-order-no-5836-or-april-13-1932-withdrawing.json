    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of resolution and perhaps a controlled optimism, especially for ex-service men. There's no strong indication of negative emotions like disgust, fear, or sadness. Surprise is also unlikely. Joy might be present due to the opportunity for homesteading, but it's not overtly emphasized. Therefore, I'll adjust the joy score slightly upwards and keep the other scores low.",
