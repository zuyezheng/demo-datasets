    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order regarding aircraft entering the Canal Zone. It's a legal and administrative document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The language is formal and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default score of 1 due to the lack of emotional content.",
