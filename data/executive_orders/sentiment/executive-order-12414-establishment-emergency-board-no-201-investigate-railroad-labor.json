The order itself doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. However, implicit emotions could be present. The order may aim to convey a sense of calm and resolution (low joy), but also a sense of concern that the dispute needs to be resolved (low sadness and fear). There is no indication of disgust or surprise.",
