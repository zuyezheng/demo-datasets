    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate a labor dispute. It uses formal and legalistic language. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of seriousness and urgency might be inferred. The most relevant emotions would be low levels of concern (fear/sadness) and perhaps a touch of surprise that the situation requires presidential intervention. However, the overall emotional intensity is low.",
