The language is neutral and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After further consideration, the formal and unemotional nature of the document suggests that the initial assessment is accurate, and no revisions are necessary.",
