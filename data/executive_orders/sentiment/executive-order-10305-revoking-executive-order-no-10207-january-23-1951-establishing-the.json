    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It revokes a previous order and directs the Department of Treasury to liquidate the affairs of a commission. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the act of revoking an order could imply a negative sentiment towards the commission's purpose or actions, or a desire to move in a different direction. Given the lack of explicit emotional cues, the scores should be low, but not 1, for sadness and disgust, as these are the most likely emotions to be conveyed. The other emotions should be scored as 1.",
