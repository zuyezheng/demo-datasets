    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, procedural document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order outlines a process for the Personnel Classification Board to review and change position allocations, with a provision for departmental heads to protest changes to the President. There is a slight possibility of surprise at the level of detail, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
