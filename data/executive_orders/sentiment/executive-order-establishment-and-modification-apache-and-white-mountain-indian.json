    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for Native American reservations. It primarily uses neutral and legal language. There is a slight sense of decisiveness and authority, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for decisiveness which might be interpreted as a low level of joy or surprise that the order is being given.",
