    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for Native American reservations. It primarily uses neutral and legal language. There is no explicit or implicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Since the document reallocates land, it is possible that it evokes a bit of sadness. The tone of the document is neutral, so the revised scores should reflect that.",
