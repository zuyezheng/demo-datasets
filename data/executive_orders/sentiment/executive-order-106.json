    "critique": "The document is a formal order excusing certain employees from duty to attend a statue unveiling. The primary emotion conveyed is respect for veterans and the late General John A. Logan. There is a slight sense of joy and pride in honoring these individuals, but overall, the tone is formal and respectful. Therefore, joy is scored low, and other emotions are scored even lower as they are not relevant to the document's purpose.",
