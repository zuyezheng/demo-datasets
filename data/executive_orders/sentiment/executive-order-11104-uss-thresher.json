    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order to lower the flag to half-staff in remembrance of the lives lost on the U.S.S. THRESHER. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the tragic event. There might be a touch of respect and solemnity, but sadness is the most prominent emotion. There is no explicit expression of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign low scores to these emotions.",
