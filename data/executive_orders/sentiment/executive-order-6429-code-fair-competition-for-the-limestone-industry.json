    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of a code of fair competition. It uses formal and legalistic language. The president is conveying a sense of duty and approval, but not necessarily strong emotions. The primary emotion conveyed might be a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the process has been completed and a code has been approved. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this: Joy might be a 3, and all other emotions a 1.",
