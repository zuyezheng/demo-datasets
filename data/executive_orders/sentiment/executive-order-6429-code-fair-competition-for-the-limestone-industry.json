    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of a code of fair competition. It uses formal language and aims to convey a sense of order and compliance. There is no strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is a mild sense of satisfaction or approval, but it's very subdued. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on joy to reflect the positive nature of the approval.",
