It aims to protect wildlife and natural resources, which might evoke a sense of joy in some, but also a sense of fear if these resources were not protected. There might be a slight sense of disgust at the thought of the actions that necessitate this order (e.g., setting fires, disturbing wildlife). There is no element of surprise or sadness.",
