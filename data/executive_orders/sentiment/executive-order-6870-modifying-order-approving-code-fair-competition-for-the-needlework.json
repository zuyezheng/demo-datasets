It addresses a disagreement and modifies a previous order to ensure representation and progress in the Needlework Industry in Puerto Rico. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed should be joy (resolution of conflict) and perhaps a touch of surprise (due to the modification). There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
