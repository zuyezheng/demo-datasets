There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is neutral in tone, focusing on the legal and procedural aspects of the decision. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content.",
