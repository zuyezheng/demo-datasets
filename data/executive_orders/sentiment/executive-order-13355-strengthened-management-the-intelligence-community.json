    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on strengthening intelligence activities and national security. The language is legalistic and procedural, lacking emotional expression. The primary goal is to convey authority and a sense of security through enhanced intelligence operations. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal, with slight feelings of reassurance or perhaps concern depending on their views on government power. Given the nature of the document, I would expect low scores across all emotions. I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
