    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order issued by President Clinton. It addresses a dispute between railroads and labor organizations and establishes an emergency board to investigate the matter. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no overt expression of emotion. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal. However, the public might feel a slight sense of relief (low joy) that the President is taking action to prevent disruption of essential transportation services. There might also be a very slight sense of surprise that the President is involved in this issue.",
