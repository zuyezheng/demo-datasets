    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute in the railroad industry. The language is legalistic and aims to establish an emergency board to investigate and resolve the dispute. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the implicit emotions are: A sense of urgency and concern (fear) about the potential disruption to interstate commerce, a desire to resolve the dispute (joy), and a sense of responsibility (sadness). The order aims to prevent negative consequences, so there is a low level of disgust. There is no surprise.",
