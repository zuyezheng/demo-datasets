    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining regulations for interagency motor-vehicle pools. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to establish efficient and economical transportation, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a slight sense of reassurance (low joy) for those who value efficient government operations and perhaps a touch of surprise at the level of detail.",
