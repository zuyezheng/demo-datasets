    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document that modifies previous executive orders to permit the leasing of certain lands for use as a public airport. The language is formal and factual, and the purpose is to make a legal change. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of joy for those who would benefit from the creation of a public airport, and perhaps a very mild surprise that such an order was issued. The order does not seem designed to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
