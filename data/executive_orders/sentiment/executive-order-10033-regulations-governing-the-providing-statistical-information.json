    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, efficiency, and national responsibility. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to establish a clear process for providing statistical information to international organizations. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a very mild sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage international obligations efficiently. This could translate to a slight feeling of joy or perhaps surprise that such a detailed process is in place. However, these emotions would be very subtle.",
