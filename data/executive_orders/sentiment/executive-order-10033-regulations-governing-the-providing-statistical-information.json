    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It lays out procedures for providing statistical information to international organizations. The language is very formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. A baseline of 1 is appropriate for all emotions, with slight increases if the text suggests otherwise. There's a very slight sense of satisfaction or perhaps even joy in establishing a systematic procedure, but it's very muted. There's no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
