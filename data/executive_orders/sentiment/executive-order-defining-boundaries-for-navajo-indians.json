    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Navajo Indians. It's a factual statement with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a base score of 1 for all emotions initially, as the document itself doesn't convey any specific sentiment. After further consideration, the document is purely informational and unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. The initial scores accurately reflect this lack of emotional content.",
