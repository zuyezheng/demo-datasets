    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Navajo Indians. It's a legal document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary purpose is to define boundaries and withdraw land from sale and settlement. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, likely a 1, as there's not enough information to suggest any significant emotional conveyance.",
