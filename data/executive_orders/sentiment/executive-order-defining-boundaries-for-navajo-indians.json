    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual statement about land allocation. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue that it might bring a sense of relief or satisfaction (a mild form of joy) to the Navajo Indians, and perhaps a bit of disappointment (a mild form of sadness) to those who were hoping to settle on that land. Surprise, fear, disgust, and strong joy or sadness seem unlikely.",
