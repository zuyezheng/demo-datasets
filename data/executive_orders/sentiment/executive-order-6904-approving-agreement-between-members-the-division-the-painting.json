    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of an agreement within the construction industry, signed by President Roosevelt. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, there might be a subtle sense of joy that the agreement was reached and approved, contributing to the recovery effort. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
