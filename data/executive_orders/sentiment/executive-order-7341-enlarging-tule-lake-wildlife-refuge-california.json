    "critique": "The document is a presidential order regarding land allocation for wildlife refuge. It's a formal, legal document. There's no explicit emotional language used. The primary emotion conveyed might be a sense of duty or responsibility, but it's very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions initially. Then, I'll revise it slightly upwards for 'joy' as the creation of a wildlife refuge could be seen as a positive action.",
