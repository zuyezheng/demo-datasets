    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of determination and commitment to equity and equal opportunity. There's a hint of sadness acknowledging past failures and disparities, but the overall tone is forward-looking and resolute. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is relatively low as it's more of a recognition of past issues rather than dwelling on them. The joy score is moderate, reflecting the positive vision of a more equitable future. The surprise score is low, as the order is a planned policy implementation.",
