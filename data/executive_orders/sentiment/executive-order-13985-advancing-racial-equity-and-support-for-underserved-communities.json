    "critique": "The executive order aims to address inequities and promote equal opportunity. It acknowledges past disparities and seeks to create a fairer system. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are hope and a sense of justice. There might also be a subtle element of sadness related to the acknowledgement of past failures. Surprise and disgust are not primary emotions the order tries to convey. Fear is also not a primary emotion, although the order acknowledges the existence of crises.",
