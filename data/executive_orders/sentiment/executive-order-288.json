    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement of the death of ex-President Ulysses S. Grant and a directive to close government offices. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death of a respected figure. There might be a touch of respect and solemnity, but joy, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the most prominent emotion.",
