The language is neutral and objective, with the primary goal of conveying information about the committee's members, purpose, and function. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After a second thought, I still believe the emotions are very low, and I will keep the initial scores.",
