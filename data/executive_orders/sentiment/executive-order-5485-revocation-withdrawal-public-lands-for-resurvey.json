    "critique": "The executive order is a simple revocation of a previous order regarding land withdrawal in New Mexico. It's a very dry, administrative document. There's no inherent emotional content in such an order. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low. After further consideration, there is no reason to revise the initial scores, as the document remains devoid of significant emotional cues.",
