    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of official action and conservation. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and declarative, focusing on establishing a wildlife refuge. Therefore, most emotions would be rated low. I will give a slightly higher score to joy as the creation of a wildlife refuge could evoke a sense of joy.",
