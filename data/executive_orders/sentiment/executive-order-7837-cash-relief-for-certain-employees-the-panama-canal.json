    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of assurance and trust in the government's handling of relief for Panama Canal employees. It doesn't seem to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Instead, it focuses on establishing clear procedures and guidelines for the distribution of cash relief. The primary goal appears to be to convey a sense of order and fairness in the administration of the program.",
