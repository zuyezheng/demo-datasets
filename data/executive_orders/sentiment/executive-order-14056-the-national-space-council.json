    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that establishes the National Space Council and outlines its responsibilities. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order, authority, and competence. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are not strong, but should lean towards inspiring confidence and perhaps a mild sense of anticipation for progress in space policy. There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild element, but not a primary one.",
