    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to inspire hope and confidence in the government's ability to address the economic challenges in Puerto Rico. It establishes an administration to provide relief, create jobs, and stimulate the economy. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with a secondary emotion of surprise at the scale and scope of the intervention. There might be a slight reduction of fear and sadness due to the relief efforts.",
