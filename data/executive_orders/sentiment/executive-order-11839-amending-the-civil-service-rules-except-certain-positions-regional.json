    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a sense of authority and determination to implement a policy change. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the act of issuing an order and amending civil service rules suggests a degree of determination and perhaps a subtle sense of importance or urgency. Given the formal nature, the intensity of any implied emotion is likely to be low.",
