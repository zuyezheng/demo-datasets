    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability, control, and coordination. It doesn't explicitly evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a subtle sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage arms control might be intended. The initial scores reflect this low-intensity emotional intent. Upon further reflection, the order's primary goal is to establish a framework for policy coordination, which should inspire confidence and reduce uncertainty. Therefore, I will adjust the 'joy' and 'surprise' scores to reflect a slightly more positive outlook, while keeping the other scores low.",
