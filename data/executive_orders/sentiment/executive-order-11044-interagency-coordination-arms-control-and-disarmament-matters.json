It establishes procedures for coordination and resolution of differences of opinion between the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and other government agencies. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. A score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions except perhaps a very mild sense of importance or seriousness which could be interpreted as a very low level of concern, but even that is a stretch.",
