    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation. It revokes the establishment of the Tulerosa Valley as an Indian reservation and restores the land to the public domain. The language is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the act of revoking a reservation could implicitly convey sadness or anger to those negatively affected, and perhaps joy or satisfaction to others. Given the formal nature and lack of explicit emotional cues, the scores should be low, with a slight lean towards sadness due to the revocation of the reservation. Surprise, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context.",
