    "critique": "The executive order regarding Guantanamo Bay Naval Defensive Sea Area seems to aim for a sense of security and national defense rather than eliciting strong emotions. While it might instill a sense of security (a form of joy) in some, it could also cause a bit of fear in others due to the restrictions imposed. Surprise, disgust, and sadness are unlikely to be primary emotions conveyed.",
