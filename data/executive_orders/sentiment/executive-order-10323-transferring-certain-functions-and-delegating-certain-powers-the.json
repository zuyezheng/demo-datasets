    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order and efficiency in supporting small businesses, particularly in the context of defense. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is administrative, focusing on transferring functions and responsibilities to the Small Defense Plants Administration. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy to 2, sadness to 1, anger to 1, fear to 1, disgust to 1, and surprise to 2.",
