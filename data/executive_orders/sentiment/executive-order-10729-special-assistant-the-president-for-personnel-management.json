    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It establishes a new position in the White House and outlines the responsibilities of that position. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed in the document. The most prominent emotion might be a mild sense of purpose or determination to improve personnel management, but this is very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy, reflecting the positive intent of improving personnel management.",
