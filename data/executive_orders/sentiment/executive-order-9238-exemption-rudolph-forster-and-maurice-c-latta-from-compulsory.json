    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President regarding exemptions from compulsory retirement for two White House employees. It uses formal and legalistic language. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue there is a slight sense of joy that these two employees are allowed to continue their service, but it is very subtle. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
