    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration outlining the authority and direction for economic cooperation. It does not seem to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is primarily administrative and legal in nature, focusing on the allocation of funds and the determination of certain legal exemptions to further the purposes of specific titles within the Foreign Assistance Act. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
