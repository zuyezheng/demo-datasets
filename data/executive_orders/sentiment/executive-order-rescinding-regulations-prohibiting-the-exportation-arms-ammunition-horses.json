    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement rescinding previous executive orders related to the exportation of arms, ammunition, horses, mules, and livestock. The language is formal and factual, without any explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a low score of 1 for each emotion to reflect this neutrality.Revised Scores: Given the lack of emotional content, the initial scores accurately reflect the expected public sentiment. Therefore, no revision is necessary.",
