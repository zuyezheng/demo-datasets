    "critique": "The document expresses a formal declaration of national emergency and outlines specific sanctions against South Africa due to its apartheid policies. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of disapproval and concern regarding the situation in South Africa. There's a strong undercurrent of moral opposition to apartheid, which could be interpreted as a form of disgust. The declaration of a national emergency also suggests a level of fear or concern about the potential impact of South Africa's policies on the United States. However, the document maintains a formal and diplomatic tone, so the intensity of these emotions is moderate. There is little to no joy or surprise present in the document. The sadness score reflects the situation in South Africa.",
