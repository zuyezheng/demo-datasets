    "critique": "The document expresses a strong stance against apartheid in South Africa. The president uses formal and assertive language to declare a national emergency and impose sanctions. The emotions conveyed are primarily related to disapproval and a sense of urgency. There's an element of disgust towards the apartheid policies and a degree of fear regarding the threat to US foreign policy and economy. However, there's also a sense of hope that these measures will promote peaceful change. The intensity of these emotions would likely be perceived differently by various segments of the American public, but overall, the document aims to project a serious and determined response.",
