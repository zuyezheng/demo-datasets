    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding intelligence activities. It is primarily concerned with establishing guidelines, responsibilities, and oversight mechanisms for the Intelligence Community. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, focusing on clarity and precision rather than emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal, with perhaps a slight sense of reassurance that intelligence activities are being regulated. Given the nature of the document, I would expect very low scores across all emotions.",
