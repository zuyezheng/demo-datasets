    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining procedures for water resource management. It aims to ensure coordinated planning and independent review of federal water resource projects. The intended emotional response is likely to be a sense of confidence and assurance that water resources are being managed responsibly and efficiently. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy that the government is taking steps to protect resources. There may also be a slight sense of surprise that the government is taking these steps.",
