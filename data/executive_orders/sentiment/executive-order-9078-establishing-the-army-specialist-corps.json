    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Army Specialist Corps during World War II. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, with no overt emotional expression. The purpose is to create a structure for employing civilian specialists in the War Department. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal. Most emotions should be scored low, with a slight consideration for surprise due to the establishment of a new corps.",
