    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order and structure, potentially instilling a sense of calm and trust. There might be a hint of surprise at the level of detail, but overall, the goal is to project competence and control rather than strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the feeling of trust and reduce the surprise, as the order is more about establishing a system than shocking the audience.",
