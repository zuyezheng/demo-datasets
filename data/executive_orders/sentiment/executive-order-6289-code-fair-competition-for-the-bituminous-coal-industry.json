    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Bituminous Coal Industry. The language is legal and administrative, with no overt emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of authority and decisiveness, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed might be a subdued sense of optimism or hope that this code will improve the industry, but it's very subtle.I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive nature of the announcement.",
