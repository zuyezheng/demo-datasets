    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, modifying a previous order to allow a railway company to build a right of way. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is factual and procedural, so it shouldn't make people feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be very low for all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
