It primarily conveys sadness and respect for the fallen soldiers. There might be a hint of surprise that the government is taking such action. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, or disgust.The initial scores reflect this assessment, with sadness being the highest, followed by surprise, and the other emotions being minimal.
