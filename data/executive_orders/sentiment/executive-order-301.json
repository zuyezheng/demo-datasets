The primary emotion the president wants to convey is sadness, a respectful mourning for the fallen soldiers. There might also be a subtle element of joy in remembering and honoring their sacrifice, but sadness is the more dominant emotion. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
