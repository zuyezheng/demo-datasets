    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding the reestablishment of the Toiyabe National Forest. It's a legal and administrative document, so strong emotions are unlikely. Joy might be present due to the positive impact of reestablishing a national forest, but it would be subdued. Sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be present. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with a slight emphasis on joy. The revised scores are even more subdued, reflecting the formal nature of the document.",
