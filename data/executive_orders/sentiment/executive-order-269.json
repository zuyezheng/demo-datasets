    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of joy and surprise at the international collaboration and celebration. There might be a slight sense of joy in celebrating the city's anniversary and surprise at the participation of foreign soldiers. However, the overall tone is formal and procedural, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for joy and surprise and zero for other emotions. Upon reflection, the surprise might be a bit higher than initially assessed, as the invitation and acceptance of foreign soldiers could be seen as somewhat unexpected. Therefore, the revised surprise score is slightly increased.",
