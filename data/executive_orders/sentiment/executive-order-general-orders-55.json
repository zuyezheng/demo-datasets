It primarily conveys information about changes in military districts and regulations regarding commerce in the newly acquired territory of Alaska. There is a sense of resolution and order being established after the Civil War, but emotions are largely absent. The joy score is low because it is a formal document. The sadness score is low because it is a formal document. The fear score is low because it is a formal document. The disgust score is low because it is a formal document. The surprise score is low because it is a formal document.",
