It emphasizes the importance of humanitarian values, transparency, and efficiency. Therefore, the primary emotions to convey are joy (related to hope and generosity) and surprise (related to innovation and improvements). There might be a slight element of sadness related to past delays and inefficiencies, but it's not a dominant emotion. There is no intention to convey anger, fear, or disgust.",
