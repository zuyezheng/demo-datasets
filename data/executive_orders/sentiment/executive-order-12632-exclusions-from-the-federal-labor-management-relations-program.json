    "critique": "The document is an executive order. Executive orders typically do not convey emotions. The language is formal and legalistic. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further reflection, the document aims to reassure the public of national security, so a slight emphasis on confidence and control might be present, but not joy. The order addresses a legal challenge, so there might be a hint of frustration, but it's minimal.",
