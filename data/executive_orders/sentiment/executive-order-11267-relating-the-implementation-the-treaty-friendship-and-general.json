    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the Attorney General as the competent national authority. It invokes the authority of the President and references a treaty with Spain. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a slight sense of duty and purpose. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy, sadness, surprise, disgust, and fear to reflect the formal and serious nature of the document.",
