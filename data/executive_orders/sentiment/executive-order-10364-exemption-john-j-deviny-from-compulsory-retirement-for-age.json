    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the retirement of a public official. It primarily conveys a sense of official procedure and legal compliance. There is a slight hint of positive sentiment in recognizing the value of John J. Deviny's continued service, but this is very subdued. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be scored low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
