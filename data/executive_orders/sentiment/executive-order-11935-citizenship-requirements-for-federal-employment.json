    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to Civil Service Rule VII regarding citizenship requirements for competitive examinations and appointments. The language is legal and procedural. There is no explicit emotional expression. However, the amendment could be interpreted as conveying a sense of nationalistic pride (joy) and perhaps a hint of fear or concern regarding non-citizens holding positions in the competitive service. Given the formal nature, these emotions are likely very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and fear, and a score of 1 to the other emotions.",
