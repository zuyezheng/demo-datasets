    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of national pride and security by restricting government jobs to citizens. This could evoke joy in some, and perhaps fear or disgust in others who feel it's discriminatory. Surprise is unlikely, and sadness isn't a primary goal. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the joy and decrease the negative emotions after further consideration.",
