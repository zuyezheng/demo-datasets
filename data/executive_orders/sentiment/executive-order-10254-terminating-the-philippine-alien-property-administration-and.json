    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the termination of the Philippine Alien Property Administration and the transfer of its functions and assets to the Attorney General. Given the formal and legal nature of the document, the emotional tone is expected to be neutral. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of strong emotional conveyance.",
