    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It expresses a sense of urgency and authority, but does not convey strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on concern or seriousness which might translate to a touch of sadness or fear regarding the potential disruption of interstate commerce. The revised scores will reflect this assessment.",
