    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that withdraws land from settlement for flood control purposes. The primary emotion conveyed should be a sense of security and perhaps slight surprise that the order is so old. The order is intended to reassure the public that measures are being taken to protect them from floods. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The surprise is due to the age of the document.",
