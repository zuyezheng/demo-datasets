    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the reporting procedures for the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands. It outlines the legal basis for the change and designates the War Department as the recipient of these reports. Given the formal and administrative nature of the document, the emotional intensity is expected to be low across all emotions. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion.",
