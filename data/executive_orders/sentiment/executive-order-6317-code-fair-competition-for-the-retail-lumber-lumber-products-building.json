    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability rather than strong emotions. While it's not explicitly joyful, the order's purpose is to instill a sense of progress and resolution, which could be interpreted as a mild sense of joy. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as executive orders are generally expected announcements. Therefore, I'll score joy as a 3 and the other emotions as 1 initially. Upon further consideration, the primary goal is to inspire confidence and stability, downplaying strong emotions. Therefore, I will reduce the joy score to 2 and keep the rest at 1.",
