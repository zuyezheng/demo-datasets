    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and assurance regarding the management and preservation of natural resources, specifically the Seney Migratory Waterfowl Refuge. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal appears to be administrative and legal clarity. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board.",
