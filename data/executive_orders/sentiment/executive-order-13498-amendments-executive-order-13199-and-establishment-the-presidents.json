    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to strengthen the ability of faith-based and other neighborhood organizations to deliver services. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of purpose and determination, but emotions are largely suppressed in favor of a professional tone. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be scored low, with slightly higher scores for joy and surprise due to the positive nature of the initiative and the potential for unexpected outcomes.",
