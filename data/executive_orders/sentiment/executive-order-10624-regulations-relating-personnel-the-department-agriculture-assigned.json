    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual, and legal document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about assigning personnel of the Department of Agriculture to service abroad and coordinating their activities with foreign policy objectives. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order does not strongly convey any particular emotion. The revised scores remain the same.",
