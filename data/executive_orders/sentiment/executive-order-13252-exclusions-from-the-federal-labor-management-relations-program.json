    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily deals with legal and administrative matters, specifically exempting certain subdivisions of the Department of Justice from the Federal Labor-Management Relations Program due to national security considerations. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and objective, focusing on legal and procedural aspects. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal presence of these emotions.",
