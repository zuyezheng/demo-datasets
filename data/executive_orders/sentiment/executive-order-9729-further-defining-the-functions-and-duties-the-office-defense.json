    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and determination to manage resources during a period of national defense. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is very formal and legalistic, so the emotional content is minimal. Therefore, the initial scores are set to reflect this.",
