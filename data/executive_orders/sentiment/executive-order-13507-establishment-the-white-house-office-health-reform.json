    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding health care reform. It expresses a sense of determination and commitment to improving the health care system. There is a clear intent to address problems and implement solutions. The emotions conveyed are primarily positive, with a focus on hope and improvement, but also acknowledging the existing problems. Therefore, I will score it for joy, hope, and a little bit of concern about the current state of affairs. There isn't much anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document, so I will give those low scores.",
