    "critique": "The executive order primarily focuses on the design and specifications of the Vice President's Coat of Arms, Seal, Color, and Flag. It is a formal and descriptive document with the purpose of establishing and standardizing these symbols. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to provide clarity and uniformity in the representation of the Vice President. Therefore, the emotion scores should be very low.",
