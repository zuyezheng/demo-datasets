    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a presidential commission. It outlines the commission's purpose, functions, administration, and general provisions. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional tone. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, reflecting the document's neutral and official nature. There might be a slight sense of joy if the public perceives this as a positive step towards international relations, but it would be very mild. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
