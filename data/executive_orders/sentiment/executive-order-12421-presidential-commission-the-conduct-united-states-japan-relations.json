    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to develop recommendations for US-Japan relations. The language is formal and objective. There is a sense of optimism and anticipation for improved relations, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise due to the positive outlook and the establishment of a new commission.",
