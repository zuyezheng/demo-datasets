    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to civil service rules. It primarily focuses on the structure and function of civil service examination boards. There's no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. The language is formal and procedural, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After further consideration, the document seems to convey a sense of importance and authority, so I will slightly increase the joy score.",
