It specifies the order of succession in the event of the absence, sickness, resignation, or death of both the Secretary and Under Secretary of Agriculture. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be surprise, if someone was curious about the line of succession. However, the intensity would be very low.",
