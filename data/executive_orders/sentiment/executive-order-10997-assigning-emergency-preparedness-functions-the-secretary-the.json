    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order outlining emergency preparedness responsibilities for the Secretary of the Interior. It focuses on resource management and coordination in the event of a national emergency. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the underlying context of preparing for a potential attack or national emergency implies a sense of concern and urgency, which could be interpreted as a low level of fear and perhaps a touch of determination (joy). Given the formal nature, the scores should be low.",
