    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order to extend the deadline for a report and allow for public hearings. The primary emotions conveyed are intended to be neutral, focusing on the procedural aspects of governance. There is a slight element of reassurance that the government is addressing the issue of hostage compensation, but it is not strong. Therefore, I will score joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all as 1 initially. After further consideration, I will keep all scores at 1, as the document is intended to be neutral and factual.",
