    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped. It outlines the committee's composition, functions, and administrative matters. The language is formal and legalistic, with a focus on establishing structure and authority. There is a sense of purpose and determination to address the issue of employment for the handicapped, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on joy due to the positive nature of the initiative.",
