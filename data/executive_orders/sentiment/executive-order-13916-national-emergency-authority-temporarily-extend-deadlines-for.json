    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration of emergency authority related to COVID-19. It invokes the National Emergencies Act and provides the Secretary of the Treasury with additional authority to respond to the emergency. The language is legal and procedural. There is a sense of seriousness and urgency, but emotions are largely absent. Therefore, the initial scores are set to low values, with slight emphasis on fear and sadness due to the context of a national emergency.",
