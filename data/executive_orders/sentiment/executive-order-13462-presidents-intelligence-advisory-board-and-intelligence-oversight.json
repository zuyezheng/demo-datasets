    "critique": "The executive order aims to establish advisory boards for intelligence oversight. The primary emotion it seeks to convey is trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage intelligence activities effectively. It also conveys a sense of seriousness and importance regarding national security. There is no intention to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not the primary goal, but the establishment of new boards might generate a mild sense of it.",
