    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the employment of Miss Mary Edwina Coons. It mentions her satisfactory service and qualification in a civil service examination, but also notes the restriction on her permanent appointment. The language is neutral and factual, without any explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions.The initial scores reflect the lack of emotional content in the document. The revised scores remain the same as the initial scores, as the critique confirms the absence of significant emotional conveyance.",
