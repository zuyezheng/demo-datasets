    "critique": "The document expresses strong disapproval and concern regarding the actions of the previous administration. It conveys a sense of injustice and a need for accountability. The language used, such as 'weaponization,' 'political pain,' and 'inconsistent with the Constitution,' evokes feelings of anger, disgust, and fear. The president aims to reassure the public that steps are being taken to address these issues, potentially instilling a sense of hope or relief, but the primary emotions conveyed are negative due to the nature of the described events. Therefore, I will score it accordingly.",
