    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining delegations of authority and waivers for participation in the New York World's Fair. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such a detailed order is necessary for a World's Fair. There might also be a slight sense of joy related to the idea of the United States participating in the fair.",
