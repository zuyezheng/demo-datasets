The primary goal appears to be to stagger the terms of Indian-leader members to provide continuity. There's no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. The language is formal and bureaucratic. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions. Since there is not enough information, I will assign a score of 1.",
