It should instill a sense of confidence and security, but also a degree of concern regarding potential disruptions to the war effort. The order seeks to minimize fear and disgust, while emphasizing the importance of unity and purpose. The initial scores reflect a moderate level of fear and surprise due to the nature of the order, with a focus on conveying joy and minimizing negative emotions.
