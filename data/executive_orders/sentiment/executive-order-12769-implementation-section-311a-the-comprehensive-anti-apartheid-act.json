    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the termination of sanctions against South Africa. It primarily conveys a sense of resolution and official action. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legal and procedural, not emotional. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on resolution or perhaps a muted sense of relief.",
