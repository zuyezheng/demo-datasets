    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the termination of sanctions against South Africa. It primarily conveys a sense of resolution and finality concerning the implementation of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legal and procedural, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions are scored low, with a slightly higher score for resolution.",
