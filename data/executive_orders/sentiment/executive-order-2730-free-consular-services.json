    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the White House regarding consular fees for military personnel during wartime. It's a directive, so it's unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of relief or gratitude for the military personnel who benefit from the fee waiver, but it's very subtle. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on joy.",
