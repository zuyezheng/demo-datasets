    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about land withdrawal for military use. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is factual and procedural, so it shouldn't make people feel particularly joyful, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, or surprised. The initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
