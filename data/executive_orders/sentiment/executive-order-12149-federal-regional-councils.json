    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing Federal Regional Councils. It focuses on interagency and intergovernmental cooperation. The language is formal and procedural. There is no strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to establish a structure and process, not to evoke emotions. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on neutral or slightly positive aspects due to the intention of cooperation and improvement.",
