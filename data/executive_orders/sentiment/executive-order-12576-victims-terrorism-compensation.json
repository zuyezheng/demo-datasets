    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding compensation for hostages. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The language is legal and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon review, this seems appropriate as the document is purely administrative.",
