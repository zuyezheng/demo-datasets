    "critique": "The document is a proclamation regarding a national emergency and the suspension of certain labor laws for workers employed by the Atomic Energy Commission. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of urgency and seriousness due to the national emergency. There might be a hint of fear or concern underlying the need to strengthen national defense. However, the language is formal and legalistic, which tempers strong emotional expression. Therefore, I will assign moderate scores to fear and surprise, and low scores to the other emotions. After further consideration, the document is formal and factual, so I will reduce the initial scores and keep them very low.",
