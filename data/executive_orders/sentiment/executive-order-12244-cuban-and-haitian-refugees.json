    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding an exemption for Fort Allen. The language is legal and procedural. There is no explicit emotional appeal. However, the context of relocating and temporarily housing Haitian and Cuban nationals might evoke some emotions. Given the nature of the document, the expected emotional response from the public is likely to be minimal across all emotions. Most people will likely not have a strong reaction to this document. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
