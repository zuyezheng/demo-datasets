    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the use of supplies and equipment during wartime. It invokes legal authority and outlines specific actions to be taken by government agencies. The language is formal and bureaucratic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, around 1, as the document is primarily informational and directive, not designed to evoke strong feelings. There might be a slight sense of surprise (2) due to the sudden change. Revised scores are provided below.",
