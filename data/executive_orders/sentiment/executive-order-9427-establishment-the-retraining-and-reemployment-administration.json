    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Retraining and Reemployment Administration. The primary emotions conveyed, if any, would likely be related to a sense of hope or relief that the government is addressing the needs of returning service members and war workers. However, the language is very formal and bureaucratic, so the emotional impact is likely to be muted. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy and surprise, as the public might feel some relief and optimism.",
