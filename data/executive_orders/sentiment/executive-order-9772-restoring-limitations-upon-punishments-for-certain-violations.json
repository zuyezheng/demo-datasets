    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding punishments for violations of Articles of War. It primarily concerns legal and administrative matters, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. The document expresses a sense of resolution and finality in terminating the suspensions of limitations upon punishments. There is a slight indication of relief or satisfaction that the previous measures are no longer necessary. Therefore, I will assign low scores for joy and sadness, and a minimal score for surprise. There is no indication of fear, disgust, or anger.",
