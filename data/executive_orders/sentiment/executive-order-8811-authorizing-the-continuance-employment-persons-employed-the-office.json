    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining employment regulations and extensions within the Office of Government Reports. It doesn't appear to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate policy and procedure in a clear and official manner. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be very low. Upon further reflection, the order might generate a slight sense of relief or security for those whose employment is extended or protected, so I will adjust the joy score slightly upward. There is no element of surprise, fear, disgust, or sadness.",
