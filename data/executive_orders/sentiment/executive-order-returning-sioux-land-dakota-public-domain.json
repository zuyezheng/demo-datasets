    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation. It primarily uses factual and legal language. Therefore, the emotions conveyed are minimal. Considering it is a formal document, I will use the language of formal documents as a baseline. I will score each document for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. For each emotion, I will score the relative intensity on a scale of 1-10 that is being conveyed. I will not consider text that are not part of the document and use a score of 1 if not enough information is provided.",
