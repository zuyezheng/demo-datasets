    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to improve coordination, efficiency, and effectiveness of US Government-sponsored international exchanges and training programs. The language is formal and objective. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, there might be a subtle sense of joy due to the potential positive impact of the program, and a sense of hope for mutual understanding and cooperation. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores are set accordingly. After a second thought, I realized that the document is purely formal and objective. Therefore, all the scores should be set to 1.",
