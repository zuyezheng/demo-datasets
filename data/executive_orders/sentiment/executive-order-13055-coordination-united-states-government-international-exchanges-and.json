    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to improve the coordination, efficiency, and effectiveness of US Government-sponsored international exchanges and training programs. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and direct government agencies. A slight sense of joy might be intended, stemming from the idea of improved coordination and mutual understanding. There might be a very mild sense of surprise at the establishment of a new working group, but this is minimal. There is no intention to evoke sadness, fear, or disgust.",
