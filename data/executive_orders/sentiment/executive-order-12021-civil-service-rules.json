    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to the Civil Service Rules. It primarily deals with the reclassification of certain positions within government agencies. Given the nature of the document, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is purely administrative and legal in tone. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a very low level of emotional expression.",
