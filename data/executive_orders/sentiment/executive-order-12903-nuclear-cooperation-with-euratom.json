    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document with the purpose of extending peaceful nuclear cooperation. It does not seem to explicitly evoke any particular emotion. However, one could argue that it subtly aims to inspire a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to manage nuclear non-proliferation and safeguard national security. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
