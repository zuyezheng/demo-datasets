    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. It expresses concern about the physical fitness of American citizens and aims to promote sports participation. The language is formal and bureaucratic. It does not express strong emotions, but there is a mild sense of concern and a desire for improvement. Therefore, I will assign low scores for sadness, fear, and disgust. There is a moderate level of joy associated with the idea of improved well-being and health. Surprise is minimal. The document aims to address deficiencies and promote positive change, so I will assign a slightly higher score for joy than the other negative emotions.",
