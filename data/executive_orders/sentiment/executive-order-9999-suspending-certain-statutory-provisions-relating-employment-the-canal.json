The order includes suspending compliance with certain acts due to a housing shortage, and it seems to be a purely administrative action. Therefore, the emotions conveyed should be minimal. I will set joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, the order might cause a slight amount of surprise as it is unexpected. Therefore, I will increase surprise to 2.",
