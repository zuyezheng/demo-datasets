    "critique": "The president is conveying a sense of urgency and necessity due to a national emergency and housing shortage. This could be interpreted as a mix of concern and determination. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, but the situation warrants a degree of concern and perhaps a hint of determination to address the issues. The scores should reflect this subtle undertone, with slightly elevated scores for concern (leaning towards sadness and fear) and a moderate score for determination (leaning towards joy).",
