    "critique": "The document discusses the authorization to employ people for the Council of National Defense during a crisis (war). The tone is formal and serious, reflecting the gravity of the situation. There is a sense of urgency and importance, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low across all emotions. After a second thought, I realized that the context of war and crisis implies some level of fear and concern, so I will adjust the fear score slightly upwards. There's also a hint of surprise that such measures are needed, so I'll adjust that slightly as well.",
