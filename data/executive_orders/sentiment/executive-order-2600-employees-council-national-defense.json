    "critique": "The document discusses the authorization to employ people for the Council of National Defense during the war, without the usual civil service requirements. The Civil Service Commission recommends the order. The language is formal and bureaucratic.The primary emotion conveyed might be a sense of seriousness and urgency due to the war, but it's not strongly emphasized. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the context of war, a slight sense of fear or concern might be present, but it's not overt. The scores are low because the document is primarily informational and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotions.Revised scores reflect a more nuanced assessment, acknowledging a slight undercurrent of concern or seriousness related to the war context, but still maintaining low scores for most emotions due to the document's formal and informational nature.",
