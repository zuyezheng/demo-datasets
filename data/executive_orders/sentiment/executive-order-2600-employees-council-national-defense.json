    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of urgency and importance, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is about authorizing the Council of National Defense to employ people without civil service restrictions due to the war. It's more about efficiency and national security. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further reflection, perhaps a slight sense of urgency or importance could be interpreted as a mild surprise or concern, but the other emotions remain irrelevant.",
