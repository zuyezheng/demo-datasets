    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish a council for global development. The language is formal and policy-oriented. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the emphasis on 'security, prosperity, respect for universal values, and a just and sustainable international order' could be interpreted as conveying a sense of optimism and determination. Considering the document's purpose and tone, the primary emotions conveyed are likely to be joy (related to the positive outcomes envisioned) and perhaps a slight sense of surprise (due to the innovative approaches mentioned). Other emotions like sadness, fear, and disgust are not directly relevant. The intensity of joy is moderate, as it's more about a hopeful outlook than exuberant happiness. Surprise is low, as the document focuses on established policies and structures.",
