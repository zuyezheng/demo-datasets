    "critique": "The executive order is a formal declaration. It identifies the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization as a public international organization. The order itself doesn't contain language that evokes strong emotions. The primary goal is to enact a designation, not to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. There might be a very slight sense of joy if someone is in favor of the designation, and a very slight sense of surprise that the designation is happening. However, these would be very mild.",
