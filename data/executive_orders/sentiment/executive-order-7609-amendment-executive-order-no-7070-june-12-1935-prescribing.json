    "critique": "The executive order is a technical document that amends a previous order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The order is about appointments and reappointments of employees paid from emergency funds, and it specifies that these appointments cannot extend beyond the expiration date of the emergency appropriation. The likely emotions are low across the board. The order might evoke a slight sense of surprise if the reader was not expecting such an amendment, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
