    "critique": "The executive order aims to evoke a sense of hope and relief, primarily targeting sadness and fear related to the plight of war refugees. While joy isn't the primary emotion, a sense of hopefulness and positive action should be conveyed. Surprise isn't a major factor, and disgust is not directly targeted, though the situation causing the need for the order might be disgusting. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the emphasis on joy to represent the hope for a better future.",
