    "critique": "The document is a formal order abolishing Sioux City, Iowa, as a customs port of entry. The language is formal and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a neutral emotional tone. After further consideration, the formal and administrative nature of the document suggests that a neutral emotional tone is appropriate. Therefore, the revised scores remain unchanged.",
