    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Chippewa Indians. It primarily uses neutral and legal language, focusing on geographical descriptions and treaty references. There is no explicit emotional expression in the text. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a low score of 1 for all emotions to reflect this neutrality.Revised scores:Disgust: 1Fear: 1Joy: 1Sadness: 1Surprise: 1",
