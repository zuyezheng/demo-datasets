    "critique": "The executive order is a dry, factual statement about abolishing export duties on tobacco in Cuba. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most likely emotion might be a mild surprise that such a specific order is being issued, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
