    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of joy and surprise. The order is intended to protect American industry, which should bring joy to those who support American businesses. The order is also somewhat surprising, as it is a rather strict measure. However, the order may also convey some sadness to those who are affected by it, such as those who are employed by foreign entities. The order may also convey some fear to those who are concerned about the potential consequences of the order. The order is unlikely to convey any disgust or anger.",
