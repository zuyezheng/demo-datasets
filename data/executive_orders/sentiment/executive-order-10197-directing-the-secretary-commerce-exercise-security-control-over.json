    "critique": "The executive order seems formal and procedural. It invokes legal authority and directs the Secretary of Commerce to take actions related to national security. The language is very measured and legalistic, so it does not seem to want to evoke strong emotions. The strongest emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such an order was issued, but even that is unlikely to be strong. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board. After further consideration, I think the initial scores are appropriate.",
