    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical amendment to civil service rules. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order pertains to positions within the Federal Bureau of Investigation and their classification under civil service rules during a specific period. It's a very specific and formal document, so it would not likely evoke strong emotions. The initial scores are all 1, indicating a neutral emotional response. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores remain the same.",
