    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and compliance with the law. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for all emotions. Upon further reflection, the document's purpose is to inspire confidence in the government's actions during the Great Depression. Therefore, a slight increase in 'joy' and a decrease in 'fear' might be appropriate to reflect a sense of stability and progress.",
