    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of formal approval and legal compliance rather than emotional conveyance. The language is very technical and procedural. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The order is intended to convey a sense of order and progress, but not necessarily joy. There might be a very slight sense of relief or optimism, but it's minimal. There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not intended, as the order follows due process.",
