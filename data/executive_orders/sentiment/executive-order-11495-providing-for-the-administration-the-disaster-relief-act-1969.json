    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that outlines the delegation of authority during a disaster. The primary emotion it aims to convey is reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to respond effectively. There might be a slight sense of relief or hope, but strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise are not intended. The order is more about establishing procedures and assigning responsibilities.",
