    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action related to land allocation for lighthouse purposes. There's no indication of an intention to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order is factual and procedural, so the scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal level of each emotion. Upon review, these scores seem appropriate as the document is purely informational and unlikely to evoke any strong emotional response.",
