    "critique": "The executive order is a revocation of a previous order regarding Potash Reserve No. 2. It's a very specific and dry legal matter. There's no inherent emotional content in such an order. The order itself doesn't aim to evoke any particular emotion in the audience. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, the revocation of an order might bring a slight sense of surprise, but it's still minimal. The final scores should reflect this.",
