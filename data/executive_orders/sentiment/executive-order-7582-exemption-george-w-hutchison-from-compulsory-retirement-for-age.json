    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of official action and adherence to legal procedures. There's a slight hint of positive sentiment in recognizing George W. Hutchison's service, but it's very subdued. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all minimal. The primary emotion might be a very mild sense of approval or agreement, but it's not strong enough to register as a distinct emotion. Given the lack of emotional content, I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially.",
