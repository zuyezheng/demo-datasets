    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order regarding the President's Commission on Migratory Labor. The language is very formal and factual. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the nature of the document, the intensity of each emotion is likely to be very low. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion to reflect the lack of emotional expression.",
