    "critique": "The executive order regarding Libya seems to aim to convey a sense of seriousness and resolve in addressing a national security threat. It's unlikely to evoke joy. Sadness might be a very mild component, considering the situation prompting the order. Anger could be present as a response to the actions of Libya. Fear is a likely emotion, given the mention of national security. Disgust could be associated with the actions that led to the order. Surprise is less likely, as such orders are often anticipated.",
