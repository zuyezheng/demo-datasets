It highlights existing disputes, potential disruptions to essential services, and the need for investigation and resolution. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke joy. However, it does aim to reduce fear and sadness by addressing the disputes. It may cause surprise that the president is involved. Disgust and anger are not relevant emotions.",
