    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement about the establishment of campaign medals. It aims to inform and recognize service members. The primary emotion it seeks to convey is joy and perhaps a touch of pride. There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of joy is moderate, as it's a formal recognition rather than a celebration.",
