    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of responsibility and efficiency. It focuses on taxpayer money and government resources. It might evoke a sense of reassurance in some, and perhaps concern or anger in others (specifically those in labor unions). The primary emotions I think the order is trying to convey are a sense of joy (that taxpayer money is being used efficiently) and perhaps a little bit of fear (that resources are being misused).",
