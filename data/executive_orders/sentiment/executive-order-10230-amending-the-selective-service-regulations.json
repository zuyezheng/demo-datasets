    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of national security and order. It's about amending regulations for the Selective Service, focusing on who is considered essential for national health, safety, and interest. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to establish clear guidelines and procedures. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily procedural, the underlying context of the Selective Service and national security might induce a very mild sense of concern or seriousness. Therefore, I will adjust the fear score slightly upwards.",
