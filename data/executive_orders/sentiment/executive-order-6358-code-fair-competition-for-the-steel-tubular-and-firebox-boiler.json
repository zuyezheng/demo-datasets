    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability rather than strong emotions. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire to convey order and control. Therefore, I would expect low scores for all emotions. My initial scores are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. After further consideration, the order might evoke a slight sense of relief or hope (akin to joy) that the government is taking action to stabilize the economy during a time of crisis. Therefore, I will increase the joy score slightly.",
