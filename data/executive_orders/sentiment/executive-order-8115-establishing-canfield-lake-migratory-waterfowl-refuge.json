    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration establishing a wildlife refuge. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Considering that the document aims to protect wildlife, there might be a slight sense of joy and surprise, but it's minimal. After a second thought, the emotional intensity is very low, so I will keep the initial scores close to 1.",
