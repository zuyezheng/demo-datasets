    "critique": "The executive order discusses sanctions against Burma due to the government's repression of democratic opposition. The order aims to evoke a sense of seriousness and concern regarding the situation in Burma. It's unlikely to evoke joy or surprise. It might evoke sadness and disgust at the Burmese government's actions, and perhaps a touch of fear regarding the implications of the situation. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
