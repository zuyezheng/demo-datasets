    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order imposing sanctions on Burma. The language is legal and technical, with the primary goal of conveying authority and outlining specific actions. There is no explicit attempt to evoke emotions. However, the context suggests a response to human rights issues in Burma, which might indirectly evoke sadness or anger in some readers. Given the formal nature and focus on legal details, the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Most people will not have enough information to feel any particular emotion. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions.",
