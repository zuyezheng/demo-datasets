    "critique": "The document is a formal communication between the Civil Service Commission and the President. It proposes an amendment to a departmental rule, specifically adding exceptions from examination for certain positions in the Departments of Justice and Agriculture. The language is formal and bureaucratic, lacking any overt emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions.I will give a score of 1 for each emotion.",
