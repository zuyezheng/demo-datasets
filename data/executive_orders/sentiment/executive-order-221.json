    "critique": "The document is a formal communication between the Civil Service Commission and the President. It requests an amendment to a departmental rule, adding exceptions for assistant attorneys in the Department of Justice and a private secretary in the Department of Agriculture. The language is formal and respectful. There is no strong emotion conveyed in this document. The presence of joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise are minimal. Therefore, I will assign a low score to each of these emotions.",
