    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the withholding of city income or employment taxes from the compensation of Federal employees. It is primarily a legal and administrative document. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal. Most people would likely not have a strong emotional reaction to this document. The primary emotions that might be conveyed are neutrality or perhaps mild interest for those directly affected. Therefore, all scores should be low.",
