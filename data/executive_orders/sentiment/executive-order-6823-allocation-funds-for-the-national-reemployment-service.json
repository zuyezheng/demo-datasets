    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a purely administrative document. The president wants to convey a sense of confidence and decisiveness in addressing the economic challenges of the time. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to inform the public about the allocation of funds for unemployment relief and public works programs. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low, reflecting the neutral and formal tone of the order.",
