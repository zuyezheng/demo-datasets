    "critique": "The document is a formal allocation of funds. It expresses no explicit emotion. The context is the Great Depression, so there might be an implicit sense of relief or hope, but the language is purely administrative. Therefore, all initial scores should be low. Upon further reflection, while the document itself is unemotional, the act of allocating funds during the Great Depression could be interpreted as a sign of hope and a proactive approach to addressing the crisis. Therefore, a slight increase in the 'joy' score is warranted to reflect this underlying sentiment.",
