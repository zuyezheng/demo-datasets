There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document focuses on fulfilling legal obligations and establishing fair competition within the industry. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional expression in the text.",
