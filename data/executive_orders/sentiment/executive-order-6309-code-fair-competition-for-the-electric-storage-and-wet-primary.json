    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a code of fair competition for the Electric Storage and Wet Primary Battery Industry. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and compliance with the National Industrial Recovery Act. Therefore, the expected emotions from the American public would be minimal. I will assign low scores across all emotions initially. Then upon further thought, I will revise the scores to reflect a slightly higher sense of Joy and Surprise, as the public might feel relieved and hopeful about the new code promoting fair competition.",
