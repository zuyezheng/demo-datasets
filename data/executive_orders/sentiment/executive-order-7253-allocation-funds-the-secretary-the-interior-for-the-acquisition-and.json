It expresses a sense of national pride and historical significance, but avoids strong emotional displays. The initial scores reflect a baseline assessment of the emotions conveyed, with slight emphasis on joy and surprise due to the positive nature of the declaration. The revised scores adjust the initial assessment to better reflect the document's formal and measured tone, reducing the intensity of all emotions.",
