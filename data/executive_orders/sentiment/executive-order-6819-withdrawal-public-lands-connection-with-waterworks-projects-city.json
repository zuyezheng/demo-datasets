    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal for waterworks projects. It uses legal and administrative language. There is no explicit emotional expression. The primary emotions that could be inferred are related to the potential impact of the order, but these are not directly conveyed in the text. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions initially. Then upon further thought, I realized that there is no emotion conveyed so I should assign a score of 1 across all emotions.",
