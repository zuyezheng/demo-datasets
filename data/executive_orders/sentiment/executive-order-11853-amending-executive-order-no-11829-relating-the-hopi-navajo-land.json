    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order. It primarily concerns legal and administrative matters related to land rights of Hopi and Navajo Tribes. The language is formal and legalistic, devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially, as the document does not convey any specific emotion. After further consideration, the formal and legal nature of the document suggests a neutral tone, reinforcing the initial scores.",
