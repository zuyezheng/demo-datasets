    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It withdraws certain islands, rocks, and pinnacles off the coast of California from settlement, location, sale, or entry for classification and in aid of legislation. There is no explicit language or indication that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. The order is factual and procedural in nature. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
