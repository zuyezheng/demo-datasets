    "critique": "The document describes the appointment of Jacob Oblock to a position as elevator operator due to injuries sustained while working as a laborer. The president is conveying a sense of compassion and support for Mr. Oblock. There is a hint of sadness due to the injuries sustained, but overall the tone is supportive and helpful. Therefore, I will score sadness as 4, joy as 6, and the rest as 1.",
