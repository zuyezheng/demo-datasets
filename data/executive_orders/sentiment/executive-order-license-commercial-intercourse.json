    "critique": "The document is a formal proclamation regarding commercial intercourse between states in insurrection and loyal states. The language is legal and formal, lacking strong emotional cues. The primary sentiment conveyed might be a sense of cautious optimism or relief, but it's very subdued. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After reflection, the initial scores seem appropriate given the formal and unemotional nature of the document.",
