    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding Haiti. It is a formal and legal document. The primary emotion conveyed would likely be concern or perhaps a sense of resolve. There isn't strong language evoking joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to address a specific political situation, so a neutral tone is expected. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for concern or resolve.",
