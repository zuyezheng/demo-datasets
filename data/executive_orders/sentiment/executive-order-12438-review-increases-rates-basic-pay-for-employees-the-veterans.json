    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding pay increases for Veterans' Administration employees. It is primarily concerned with establishing procedures and ensuring that pay increases are justified and in the best interest of the Federal government. There is no strong emotional content conveyed in this document. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Considering this is a formal document, I will give a score of 1 to all the emotions.",
