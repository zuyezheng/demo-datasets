    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It withdraws land for lookout-station purposes. There's no indication of an intent to evoke strong emotions. The most likely emotion might be a mild sense of reassurance (joy) that the government is taking steps for forest protection, but it's very mild. Therefore, I will set joy to 1 and all other emotions to 0.",
