    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's actions during the Great Depression. While not explicitly evoking strong emotions, it subtly intends to inspire a sense of joy (hope) and reduce fear (uncertainty) by showcasing decisive action. There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, with slight emphasis on joy and minimal fear reduction. The revised scores fine-tune these intensities based on the document's overall tone.",
