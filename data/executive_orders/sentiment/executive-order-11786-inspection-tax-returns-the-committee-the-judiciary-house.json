    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal and legal document. The order itself doesn't seem to directly evoke any specific emotions. It's a procedural action related to an investigation. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The initial scores are all set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon review, this seems appropriate as the document is primarily factual and procedural, not designed to elicit strong emotional responses.",
