It is a legal document, and as such, it is expected to be neutral in tone and devoid of overt emotional expression. The language is precise and procedural, focusing on outlining the steps and requirements for selection and enlistment. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise within the text. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
