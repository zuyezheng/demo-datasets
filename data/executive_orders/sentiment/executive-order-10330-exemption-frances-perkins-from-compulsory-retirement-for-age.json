    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that exempts Frances Perkins from compulsory retirement. The primary emotion conveyed should be one of neutrality or perhaps slight surprise that such an order is necessary. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The order is a procedural action, so the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with a slight emphasis on surprise due to the nature of the exemption.",
