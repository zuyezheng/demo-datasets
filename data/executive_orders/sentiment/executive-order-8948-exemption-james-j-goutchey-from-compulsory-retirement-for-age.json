    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to exempt James J. Goutehey from compulsory retirement. It is a legal document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the President is able to use their authority to help someone, but this is very subtle. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
