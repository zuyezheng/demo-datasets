    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement to close government offices for Memorial Day. The primary emotion the president wants to convey is respect and solemn remembrance for the soldiers who died in the Civil War. This would evoke sadness and respect. There might be a touch of joy in remembering their sacrifice for the country, but it is not the primary emotion. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
