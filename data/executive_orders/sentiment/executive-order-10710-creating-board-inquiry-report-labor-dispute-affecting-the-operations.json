    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding a labor dispute and the creation of a Board of Inquiry. The language is legal and official, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the context of a strike that could imperil national safety suggests a sense of concern and urgency, which might translate to a low level of fear or concern among the public. There's no indication of joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores would be low across the board, with a slightly higher score for fear.",
