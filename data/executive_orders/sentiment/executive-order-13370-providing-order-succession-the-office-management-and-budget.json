    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding succession within the Office of Management and Budget. It is primarily concerned with establishing a clear line of succession in the event that the Director and Deputy Director are unable to perform their duties. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no indication of strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Considering the formal nature of the document, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions in the absence of specific indicators.",
