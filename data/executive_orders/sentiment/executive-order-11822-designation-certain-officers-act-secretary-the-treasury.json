    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that establishes a line of succession for the Secretary of the Treasury. It revokes a previous executive order on the same topic. The order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion would be surprise, as the audience may be surprised by the level of detail, but it would be very mild. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, and disgust should all be scored as 1, and surprise should be scored as 2.",
