    "critique": "The document describes the appointment of Mrs. Josephine Jackley as a clerk in the Treasury Department. The context is that her husband, Dano M. Jackley, was a prohibition agent who was killed in the line of duty. The President is likely trying to convey a sense of sympathy and support for the widow of a fallen agent. This would evoke sadness and perhaps some surprise at the circumstances of the agent's death. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, or disgust.The initial scores reflect these considerations, with sadness and surprise being the most prominent emotions. The revised scores refine these based on a more careful reading, slightly increasing the sadness score to reflect the somber nature of the announcement.",
