    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Lemhi Valley Indian Reservation. It primarily uses legal and geographical language to define the boundaries of the reservation. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the act of setting aside land for the exclusive use of Native American tribes could be interpreted as a positive action, potentially conveying a sense of goodwill or justice, but this is not explicitly stated. Given the formal nature of the document and the lack of emotional language, the initial scores for all emotions should be low.",
