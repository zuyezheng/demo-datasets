    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a reservation for Native American tribes. It uses formal, legalistic language and focuses on geographical boundaries. There is no explicit expression of emotion. The context suggests a sense of duty or policy implementation rather than any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default of 1 due to the lack of emotional content.",
