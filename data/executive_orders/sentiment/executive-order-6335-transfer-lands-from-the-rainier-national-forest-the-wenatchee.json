    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, transferring land between national forests. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of reassurance (low joy) due to the clarification that the order doesn't change the national-forest status of any lands. There might also be a very slight surprise that this transfer is happening.",
