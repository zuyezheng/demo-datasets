    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that primarily aims to inform the public about a decision regarding the publication of the Code of Federal Regulations. It does not obviously try to evoke strong emotions. However, a sense of relief and perhaps slight joy could be associated with the efficient functioning of the government and the availability of codified regulations. A tiny amount of surprise might be associated with the level of detail. Disgust, fear, and sadness are not intended to be conveyed.",
