    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal for a ranger station. It's a legal and administrative document, so it doesn't express strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of importance or formality, but overall, the emotional intensity is low. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions initially. Then upon review, I will keep the scores as they are since the document is purely informational and formal.",
