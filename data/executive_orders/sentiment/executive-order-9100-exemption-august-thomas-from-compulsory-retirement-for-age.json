    "critique": "The document is a formal exemption from compulsory retirement for age. It mentions the name of the person being exempted, the position they hold, and the legal basis for the exemption. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Given the formal nature, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for most emotions, with a slightly higher score for surprise due to the nature of an exemption.",
