The language is formal and factual, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. After further consideration, the initial assessment remains accurate. The document's purpose is administrative, not emotional, justifying the low scores across all emotions.",
