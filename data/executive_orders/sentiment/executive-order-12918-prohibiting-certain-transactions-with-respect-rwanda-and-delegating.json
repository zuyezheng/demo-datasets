    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and resolve in addressing a specific international issue. It's unlikely to evoke joy or surprise. There might be a subtle element of fear or disgust related to the situation in Rwanda that the order addresses, and a sense of sadness about the circumstances that necessitate the order.
