    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to the Secretary of War regarding the transfer of executive authority in the Philippines from the Military Governor to the Civil Governor. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no strong expression of any particular emotion. A baseline level of formality is present, so I will assign a score of 1 for emotions that are not explicitly present. There might be a slight sense of joy that the transition to civil government is occurring, but it is very subdued. There is no explicit sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
