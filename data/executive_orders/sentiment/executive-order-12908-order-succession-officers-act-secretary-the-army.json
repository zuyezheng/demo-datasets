    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the succession of authority in the event of the Secretary of the Army's death, disability, resignation, or absence. It is a legal and administrative document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a sense of seriousness or concern for the continuity of leadership, but this is very mild. Therefore, the initial scores are set to reflect the formal and unemotional nature of the document. Revised scores reflect a more accurate assessment of the document's emotional content.",
