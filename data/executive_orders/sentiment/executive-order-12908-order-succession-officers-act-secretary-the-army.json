    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the succession of authority in the event of the Secretary of the Army's death, disability, resignation, or absence. It is a legal and administrative document, and therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The primary emotions, if any, might be a mild sense of surprise or perhaps a touch of fear related to potential instability, but these would be very low. Most people would likely not feel any strong emotion. Therefore, the initial scores are set to reflect this, with most emotions scored at 1, except for surprise which is set to 2 to acknowledge the slight possibility of that emotion being felt. After further consideration, the initial scores seem appropriate as the document is purely procedural and unlikely to evoke strong emotions.",
