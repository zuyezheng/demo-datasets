    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to exempt an employee from mandatory retirement. The language is very formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue there is a slight sense of joy that the President is allowing this person to continue working. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign a low score to joy and a score of 1 to the other emotions.",
