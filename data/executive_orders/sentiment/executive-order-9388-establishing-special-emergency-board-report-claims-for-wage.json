    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of authority and resolution, but not to evoke strong emotions. It's mostly informational and directive. The order is to establish a board to reconsider wage adjustments. There might be a slight sense of relief or hope for the employees involved, but it's very subtle. Therefore, I'll score joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise very low initially, and then revise the scores to reflect the subtle emotions.",
