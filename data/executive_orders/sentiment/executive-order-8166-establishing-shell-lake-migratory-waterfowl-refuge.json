    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of official action and conservation. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and declarative, focusing on establishing a wildlife refuge. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be relatively low.Let's start with initial scores of 1 across the board, indicating a minimal emotional presence. Upon review, the document's purpose is conservation, which might evoke a slight sense of joy or relief in some readers. However, this is not explicitly stated, so I will keep the joy score at 2 and the rest at 1.",
