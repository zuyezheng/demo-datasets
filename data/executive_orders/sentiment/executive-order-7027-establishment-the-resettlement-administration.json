    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Resettlement Administration. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of determination and purpose in addressing the economic and environmental challenges of the time. There is a hint of hope for a better future, but overall, the tone is very formal and administrative. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise are minimal. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
