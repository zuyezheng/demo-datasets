The primary goal is to convey a sense of seriousness, responsibility, and commitment to efficient use of taxpayer dollars. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are primarily joy (in the sense of satisfaction with good governance) and perhaps a touch of surprise at the commitment to transparency. There is no intention to evoke sadness, fear, disgust, or anger.",
