    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Men's Clothing Industry. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the context of the National Industrial Recovery Act suggests an underlying sense of hope and optimism for economic recovery during the Great Depression. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise, and very low scores to the other emotions.",
