    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, compliance, and governmental process rather than strong emotional responses. The primary goal is to communicate the approval of a code of fair competition. Therefore, the emotions conveyed would likely be minimal. However, there might be a slight sense of joy that the code of fair competition is approved. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a very mild surprise that the code was approved.",
