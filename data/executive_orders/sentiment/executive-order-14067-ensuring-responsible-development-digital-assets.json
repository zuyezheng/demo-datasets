    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding digital assets. It aims to establish a policy framework and coordinate efforts across various government agencies. The language is formal and technical, focusing on policy objectives, risks, and regulatory considerations. There is a sense of urgency and importance conveyed, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. The document is primarily informative and directive, rather than emotional. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
