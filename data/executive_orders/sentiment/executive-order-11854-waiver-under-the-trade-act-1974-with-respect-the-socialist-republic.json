    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that waives certain trade restrictions with Romania. The language is legal and procedural, and the likely intended effect is neutral. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further reflection, there may be a slight element of Joy that the president wants to convey. This is because the order promotes trade relations, which could be seen as a positive development. However, this joy is not strong, so it should be a low score.",
