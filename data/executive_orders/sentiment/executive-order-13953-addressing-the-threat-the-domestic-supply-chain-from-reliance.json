It invokes a national emergency and outlines steps to increase domestic mining and processing capacity. The primary emotion conveyed is fear regarding national security and economic vulnerability. There's also a hint of disgust towards the 'aggressive economic practices' of foreign producers. There is no explicit joy, sadness, or surprise conveyed in the document.
