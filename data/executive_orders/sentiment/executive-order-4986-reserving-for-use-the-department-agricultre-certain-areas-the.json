    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual declaration. It withdraws and sets aside land for the Department of Agriculture. There's no obvious attempt to evoke emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on the specific details of the land being transferred. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
