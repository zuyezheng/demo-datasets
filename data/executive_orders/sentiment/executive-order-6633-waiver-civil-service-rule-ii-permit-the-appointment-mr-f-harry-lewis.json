    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the appointment of Mr. F. Harry Lewis. It describes his qualifications and the benefits of his appointment to the Customs Service. The language is formal and bureaucratic, with no strong emotional cues. The primary purpose seems to be to justify the appointment based on Mr. Lewis's unique skills and experience. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across all emotions. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, but there might be a slight sense of approval or satisfaction due to the efficient use of resources and recognition of expertise. Therefore, I will slightly increase the joy score.",
