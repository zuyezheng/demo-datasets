    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending the composition of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that the President is focusing on physical fitness and sports, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
