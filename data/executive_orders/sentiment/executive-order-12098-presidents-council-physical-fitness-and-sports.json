    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order regarding the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. It primarily focuses on the composition of the council, specifically the number of members. Given the formal and administrative nature of the document, the emotional intensity is expected to be low across all emotions. There is no language or context suggesting strong feelings of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores are set to 1 for all emotions.",
