    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of fairness, transparency, and adherence to the rule of law. It seeks to reassure the public that regulations are duly enacted and that their obligations are clear. The order also intends to convey a sense of order and control over the regulatory process. It does not seem to want to convey strong emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, it may want to convey a mild sense of reassurance (joy) and a mild sense of concern being addressed (relief from fear).",
