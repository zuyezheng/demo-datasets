    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential waiver related to trade with Romania. It invokes legal and constitutional authority, referencing specific sections of the Trade Act of 1974. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the emotion scores should be minimal, reflecting the absence of overt emotional content. Considering it is a formal document, I will give a score of 1 for all emotions.",
