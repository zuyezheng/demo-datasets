    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land allocation for the Navajo Indian Reservation. It primarily uses formal and neutral language. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to establish a legal boundary and protect existing rights. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal, with low scores for all emotions. Since there is not enough information provided, I will use a score of 1.",
