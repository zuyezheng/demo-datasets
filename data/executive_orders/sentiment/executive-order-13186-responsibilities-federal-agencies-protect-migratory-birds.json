    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of joy and perhaps a little surprise at the dedication to conservation. There's no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust. The joy comes from the appreciation of migratory birds and the commitment to their conservation. The surprise might stem from the comprehensive nature of the order and the international cooperation involved. However, the overall tone is quite formal and policy-oriented, so the emotional impact is likely to be mild.",
