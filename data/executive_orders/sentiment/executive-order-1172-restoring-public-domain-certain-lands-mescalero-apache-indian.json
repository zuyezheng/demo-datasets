    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land within the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation. It's a legal document, so the primary emotions conveyed are neutral. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the formal and unemotional nature of the document. A score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion due to the lack of emotional content.",
