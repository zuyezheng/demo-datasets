    "critique": "The document is a formal request to the President to designate land for a reservation for the Apache Indians. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is a mild sense of concern for the well-being of the Apache Indians, but this is primarily a logistical and administrative document. Therefore, joy, surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness are minimal. There's a slight undercurrent of sadness due to the displacement of the Apaches, but it's not explicitly stated. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is a mild concern, which could be interpreted as a low level of sadness.",
