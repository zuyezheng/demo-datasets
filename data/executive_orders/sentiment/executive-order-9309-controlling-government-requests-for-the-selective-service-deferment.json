    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding selective service deferments during wartime. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of urgency and determination to efficiently manage manpower for the war effort. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on rules, procedures, and responsibilities. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on the seriousness of the situation.",
