    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of urgency and concern regarding labor disputes and their potential impact on national health and safety. It invokes legal authority and establishes a Board of Inquiry to address the issues. The emotions the president wants to evoke are primarily fear (regarding the potential consequences of the disputes) and perhaps a touch of surprise (at the extent of the problem). There might also be a hint of sadness about the situation, but it's less prominent. There is no indication of joy or disgust.",
