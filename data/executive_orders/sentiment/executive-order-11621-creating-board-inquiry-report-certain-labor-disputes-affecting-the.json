However, the context suggests a sense of concern due to the potential impact of the strikes on the national health and safety. Therefore, a low level of fear and concern might be perceived by the public. There's no indication of joy, disgust, or surprise. Sadness might be a very mild emotion due to the negative impact of the strikes.",
