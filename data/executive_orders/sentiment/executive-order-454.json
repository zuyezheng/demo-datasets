    "critique": "The document is a military order from the Secretary of War to Major-General McClellan. It outlines the President's directions regarding a plan of operations. The tone is formal and authoritative. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, a sense of urgency and determination to pursue the enemy can be inferred. Given the formal nature of the document, the emotion scores should be relatively low, with a slight emphasis on determination and a lack of fear or sadness.",
