The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the situation implies a potential negative impact on interstate commerce and essential transportation services. Therefore, a low level of concern or perhaps surprise might be inferred. The scores are based on the assumption that the public might feel a slight sense of unease or surprise due to the potential disruption.",
