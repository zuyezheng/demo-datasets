    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily aims to establish standards and ensure consistency in the allocation of field positions within governmental agencies. The language is formal and procedural, lacking overt emotional expression. Therefore, the scores for emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be low, reflecting the document's objective and unemotional nature. Considering the formal tone and the purpose of the document, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for most emotions, as there's no explicit or implicit conveyance of these feelings.",
