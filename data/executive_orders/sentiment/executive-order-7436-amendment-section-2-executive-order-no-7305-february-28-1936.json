    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order regarding emergency crop loans. The language is legal and administrative. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the act of providing relief suggests a degree of concern for the farmers' situation, which could be interpreted as a low level of sadness that the farmers are in need and a low level of joy that the government is providing help. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
