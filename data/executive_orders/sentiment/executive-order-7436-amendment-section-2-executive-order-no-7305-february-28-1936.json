    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an executive order regarding emergency crop loans. It specifies loan amounts and conditions. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional expression. However, one could argue there is a subtle element of joy in providing relief to farmers, but it's very understated. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
