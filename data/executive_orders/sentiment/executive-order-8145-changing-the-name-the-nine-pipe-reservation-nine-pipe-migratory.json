    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Nine-Pipe Migratory Waterfowl Refuge. It's a formal, legal document.  There's no inherent emotion being conveyed. The president is simply enacting a policy. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. After reflection, I still believe the scores should be very low, as the document is purely administrative.",
