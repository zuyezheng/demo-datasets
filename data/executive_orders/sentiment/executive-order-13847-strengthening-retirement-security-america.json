    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on expanding access to workplace retirement plans. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of optimism and determination to improve retirement security for American workers. There's a subtle undercurrent of concern regarding the current state of retirement plan access and the burdens on small businesses. However, the overall tone is positive and proactive. Therefore, I will score it accordingly.",
