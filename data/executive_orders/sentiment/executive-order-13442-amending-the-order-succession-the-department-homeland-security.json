    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends the order of succession within the Department of Homeland Security. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to ensure a clear line of succession, which might inspire a sense of security (low joy) and perhaps a very mild surprise that such an order is being updated. There's no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or anger being intentionally conveyed.",
