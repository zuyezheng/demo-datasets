    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Asbestos Industry by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The language is formal and legalistic, indicating an official action. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary purpose is to communicate the approval and its legal basis. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a score of 1 indicating a lack of discernible emotion.",
