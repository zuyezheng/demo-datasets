    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that establishes a committee and a commission to study and make recommendations on food and fiber policies. The language is very formal and bureaucratic. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke any strong emotions. However, a subtle sense of hope or optimism might be intended, suggesting that the actions taken will lead to positive outcomes for the public interest. There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as such orders are usually anticipated.",
