It is a formal document detailing the approval of an agreement, so it should not evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy that the agreement has been approved and things are progressing as they should. There might also be a very mild sense of surprise that the agreement has been approved. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
