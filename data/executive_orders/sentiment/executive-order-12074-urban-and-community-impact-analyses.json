    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, procedural document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is intended to make the audience feel secure and confident in the government's ability to manage policies effectively. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, but at a low level. There might be a very slight element of surprise that such a detailed procedure is being put in place, but it's minimal. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
