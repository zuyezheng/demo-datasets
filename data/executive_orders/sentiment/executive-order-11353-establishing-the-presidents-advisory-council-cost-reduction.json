    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Advisory Council on Cost Reduction. The language is formal and objective. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, a sense of responsibility and determination to improve government efficiency can be inferred. Considering the formal nature, the emotional scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on positive emotions like joy that reflects the positive impact of cost reduction.",
