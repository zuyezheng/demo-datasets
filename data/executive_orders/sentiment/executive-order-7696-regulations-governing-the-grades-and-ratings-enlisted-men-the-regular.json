    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about army grades and ratings. It doesn't seem to evoke strong emotions. It's more about conveying information in a structured manner. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The initial scores are all 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores remain the same.",
