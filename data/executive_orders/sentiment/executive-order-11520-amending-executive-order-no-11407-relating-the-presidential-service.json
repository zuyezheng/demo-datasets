    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily establishes and amends regulations regarding the Presidential Service Certificate and Badge. The language is formal and procedural. There is no strong emotional content. The emotions that could be inferred are joy for those receiving the award and respect for the office of the President. However, these are very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
