    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily focuses on amending a previous order related to service certificates and badges for military personnel assigned to the White House. The language is formal and procedural, lacking emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a low score of 1 for all emotions.",
