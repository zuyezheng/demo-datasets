    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a dry, procedural document. It outlines how passports of American citizens should be handled upon returning to the country. There is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. The order seems purely administrative. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, the order could induce a very mild sense of surprise due to the unexpected nature of passport regulations, but the effect would be minimal.",
