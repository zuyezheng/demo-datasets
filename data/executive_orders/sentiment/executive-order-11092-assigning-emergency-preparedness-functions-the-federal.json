    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding emergency preparedness for communication services. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of reassurance (or perhaps fear in some) that the government is planning for emergencies. However, the language is very technical and legalistic, which would further dampen any emotional response. Therefore, all scores should be relatively low.",
