    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding federal government procurement and immigration laws. It aims to promote economy and efficiency by ensuring contractors comply with immigration laws and use electronic employment verification systems. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, there's an implicit sense of determination to enforce immigration laws and improve government efficiency. Given the formal nature, the emotional scores should be low, reflecting the absence of overt emotional expression.",
