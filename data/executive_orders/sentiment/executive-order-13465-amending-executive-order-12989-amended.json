    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding federal government procurement and immigration laws. It aims to promote economy and efficiency by ensuring contractors comply with immigration laws and use electronic employment verification systems. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on policy and enforcement. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the order implies a concern for stability, dependability, and the enforcement of laws, which could be interpreted as a response to potential instability or inefficiency. Given the nature of the document, the expected emotional response from the public is likely to be minimal. The order is unlikely to evoke strong feelings of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low across all emotions.",
