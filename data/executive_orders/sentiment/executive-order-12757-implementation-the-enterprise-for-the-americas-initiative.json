It primarily focuses on delegating authority and outlining responsibilities related to the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no indication of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
