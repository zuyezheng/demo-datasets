    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement about a holiday closure for federal employees. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight joy or relief for those affected, but it's not a major emotional event. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy. The revised scores are even lower, acknowledging the minimal emotional impact.",
