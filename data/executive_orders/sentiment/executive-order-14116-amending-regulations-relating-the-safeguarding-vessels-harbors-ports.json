    "critique": "The executive order is primarily concerned with national security and cybersecurity. The main emotions the president likely wants to convey are fear (of cyberattacks) and a sense of security (that the government is taking action). There might be a touch of surprise at the sophistication of the cyber threats, but it's less prominent. Disgust, joy, and sadness are not relevant in this context.",
