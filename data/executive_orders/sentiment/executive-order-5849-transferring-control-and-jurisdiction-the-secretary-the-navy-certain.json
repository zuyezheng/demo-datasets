    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual declaration. There's no obvious attempt to evoke emotions. However, one could argue that establishing a naval reservation might instill a sense of security (joy) or, conversely, unease (fear) in some. Given the historical context (1932), perhaps a slight sense of reassurance is intended. I will score it accordingly.",
