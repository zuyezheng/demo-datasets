    "critique": "The document primarily concerns the revocation of a withdrawal order and land descriptions related to water supply. It's a legal/administrative document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be surprise if the revocation is unexpected, but even that is unlikely to be intense. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
