    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a reservation for several Indian tribes. The language is legal and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, with no explicit emotional expression. However, there might be a subtle undercurrent of positive emotion (joy) associated with providing land for the tribes, and a reduction of negative emotion (sadness, fear, disgust) by addressing their needs. Surprise is unlikely in such a formal document. I will assign initial scores based on this analysis, then revise them after further consideration.",
