    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It withdraws land for the use of the War Department. There's no indication of an intention to evoke strong emotions. The most likely emotion might be a mild surprise that such orders are still being issued, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, I will score all emotions as very low initially. After reflection, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
