    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. The language is formal and bureaucratic. The purpose is to enhance national security through improved intelligence. There is no explicit emotional language. However, a subtext of fear could be inferred due to the emphasis on intelligence and security, and a subtext of joy could be inferred due to the enhancement of security. The scores are based on this interpretation.",
