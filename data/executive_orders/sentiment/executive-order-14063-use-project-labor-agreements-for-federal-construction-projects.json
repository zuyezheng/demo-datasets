    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the use of project labor agreements for federal construction projects. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of promoting efficiency and preventing disruptions could be interpreted as a mild form of joy or satisfaction. There's no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
