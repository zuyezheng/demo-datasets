It seeks to reassure stakeholders that large-scale construction projects will be managed effectively, minimizing disruptions and promoting cooperation. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, stemming from the anticipation of positive outcomes. There might be a slight element of surprise at the scope and detail of the order, but this is secondary. There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
