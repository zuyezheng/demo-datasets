    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It aims to establish a board to investigate and resolve the dispute to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the implicit emotions conveyed might be concern (to prevent disruption), determination (to resolve the issue), and perhaps a hint of urgency. Considering the context, the public might feel a sense of relief that the government is taking action to prevent transportation disruptions, but also potentially some anxiety about the underlying labor issues. Therefore, I will assign low scores to fear, sadness, and disgust, and slightly higher scores to surprise and joy, with joy representing relief.",
