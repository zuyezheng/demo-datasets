    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Jicarilla Apache Indians. It primarily uses legal and geographical language. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue there is a hint of positive sentiment (joy) due to the action of setting aside land for the Jicarilla Apache Indians, but this is very subtle. The other emotions are not present. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
