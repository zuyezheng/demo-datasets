    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending regulations regarding aerial flights by enlisted men in the military. It is a formal and legal document. The primary emotions conveyed would likely be neutral, as it is simply a procedural update. There may be a slight sense of duty or seriousness associated with it, but no strong emotions are expected to be felt by the American public. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions initially. After further consideration, the document could instill a sense of fear in those who are not qualified aircraft pilots or observers, as they may be required to participate in aerial flights. Therefore, I will revise the fear score to reflect this possibility.",
