    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to revive the National Space Council and outline its functions and responsibilities. The intended audience is likely government officials, policymakers, and those involved in the space industry. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are a sense of confidence, competence, and perhaps a bit of excitement about the future of space policy. There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild element, but it's not a primary goal.",
