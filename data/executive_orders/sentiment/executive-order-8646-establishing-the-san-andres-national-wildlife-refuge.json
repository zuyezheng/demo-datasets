    "critique": "The document is a legal order establishing the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and purpose related to conservation. There's a hint of joy in preserving wildlife, but it's not overt. There's no strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this, with joy being slightly higher than the others, but all relatively low.",
