    "critique": "The document is a formal order establishing the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and purpose in protecting wildlife resources. There is a hint of joy in the conservation effort, but it's not overt. There's no strong indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic.",
