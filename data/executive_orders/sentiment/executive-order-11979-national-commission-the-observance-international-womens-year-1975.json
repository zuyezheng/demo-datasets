    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about increasing the number of members on the Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, surprise, and sadness to 1, and fear and disgust to 1.",
