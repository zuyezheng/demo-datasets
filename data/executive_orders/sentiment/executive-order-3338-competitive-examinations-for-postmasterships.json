    "critique": "The executive order is a dry, technical document about filling postmaster positions. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order seems intended to convey a sense of order and process, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
