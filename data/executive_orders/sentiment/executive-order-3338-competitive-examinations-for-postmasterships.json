There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the formal and procedural nature of the document, the emotional intensity is minimal. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a very low level of emotional expression.",
