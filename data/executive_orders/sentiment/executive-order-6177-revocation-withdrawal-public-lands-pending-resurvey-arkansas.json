    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry legal document. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, the order does open up land for homesteading by ex-service men, which might evoke a little joy. The order also prevents people from settling the land before it is officially opened, which might evoke a little disgust. Overall, the emotional impact is likely to be minimal.",
