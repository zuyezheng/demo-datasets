The president aims to inform the public about these changes and their implications. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise in the document. The language is formal and neutral, focusing on the facts of the matter. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default score of 1 due to the lack of emotional content.",
