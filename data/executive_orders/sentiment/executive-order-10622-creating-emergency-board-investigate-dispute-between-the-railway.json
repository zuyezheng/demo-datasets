    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the existence of a labor dispute and the establishment of a board to investigate it. It invokes legal authority and sets a timeline for the investigation. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a subtle sense of reassurance or relief might be intended, suggesting that the government is taking action to prevent disruption of essential transportation services. The order does not want the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The order wants the audience to feel a low level of surprise that the president is involved.",
