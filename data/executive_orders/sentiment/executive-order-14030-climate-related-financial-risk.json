    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of urgency and determination to address climate change and its financial risks. While it doesn't explicitly express emotions like joy or sadness, the underlying tone suggests concern about the potential negative impacts of climate change and a commitment to mitigating those risks. Therefore, I will score fear, and surprise higher than other emotions. The language is formal and policy-oriented, so the emotional impact is likely to be moderate rather than extreme.",
