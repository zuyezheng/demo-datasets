    "critique": "The executive order discusses violence in Syria and imposes sanctions. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are sadness about the violence and perhaps a sense of surprise or anger at the actions of the Syrian government. There might also be an element of fear conveyed, regarding the potential consequences of the situation. However, the order is written in a formal, legalistic tone, which tends to suppress strong emotional expression. Therefore, the scores should be relatively moderate.",
