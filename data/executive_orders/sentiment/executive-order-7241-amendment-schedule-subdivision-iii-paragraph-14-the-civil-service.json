    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to civil service rules. It discusses positions like informers, posse men, and special employees in the Bureau of Narcotics. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After reflection, these scores seem appropriate given the document's nature.",
