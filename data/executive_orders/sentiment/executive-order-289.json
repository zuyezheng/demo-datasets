    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement regarding the closure of government departments for the purpose of decorating the graves of soldiers who died during the rebellion. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness, reflecting the solemn occasion of remembering fallen soldiers. There might also be a hint of joy in celebrating their lives and service, and potentially surprise at the order itself. Disgust, fear, and anger are not emotions that the order is trying to convey.",
