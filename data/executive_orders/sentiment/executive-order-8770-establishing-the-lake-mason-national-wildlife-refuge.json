    "critique": "The document is a presidential order establishing a wildlife refuge. It's a formal, legal document. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of importance and authority, but not necessarily any strong sentiment. The order aims to protect wildlife, which could evoke a sense of joy or appreciation, but the document itself is neutral. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions initially, and then revise based on the context of wildlife protection.",
