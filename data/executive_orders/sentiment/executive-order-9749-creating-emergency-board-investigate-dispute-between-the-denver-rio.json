    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It doesn't express explicit emotions. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming to convey a sense of authority and impartiality. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After further consideration, the document expresses a mild sense of concern (fear) about the disruption of interstate commerce, so I will adjust the fear score slightly upwards. All other scores remain at 1.",
