    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a standard administrative document. It expresses a determination regarding the support of scouting activities overseas and directs the Secretary of Defense to issue regulations. The language is formal and objective, without any apparent intention to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values.After further consideration, it seems unlikely that this executive order is intended to evoke any strong emotions. The purpose is purely administrative. Therefore, the revised scores remain very low across all emotions.",
