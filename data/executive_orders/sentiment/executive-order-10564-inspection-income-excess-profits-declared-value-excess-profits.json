It cites legal authority and provides specific details about the scope and purpose of the inspection. The language is formal and legalistic, with no indication of strong emotions. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not explicitly conveyed. The document is primarily informational and procedural.",
