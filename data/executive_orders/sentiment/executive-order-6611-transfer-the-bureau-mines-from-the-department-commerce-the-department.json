    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document about transferring the Bureau of Mines from the Department of Commerce to the Department of the Interior. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. Maybe a tiny bit of surprise that such a transfer is happening, but overall, it's quite neutral. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with a slight surprise element. The revised scores are even more neutral, as I think even the surprise is minimal.",
