The primary goal is to communicate a legal and administrative decision. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Initial assessment: Disgust: 1, Fear: 1, Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the order is unlikely to evoke any emotions. The revised scores should remain the same.",
