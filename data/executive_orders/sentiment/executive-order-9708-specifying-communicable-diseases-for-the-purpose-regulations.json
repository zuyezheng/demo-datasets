    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document listing communicable diseases. It aims to inform and declare rather than evoke specific emotions. However, the mention of diseases like Anthrax, Cholera, and Smallpox might induce a sense of fear and concern in the reader. The order itself doesn't explicitly aim to inspire joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise, but the context of public health and disease control could implicitly generate these feelings to a minimal degree. Therefore, I will assign low scores to fear and surprise and zero to the rest.",
