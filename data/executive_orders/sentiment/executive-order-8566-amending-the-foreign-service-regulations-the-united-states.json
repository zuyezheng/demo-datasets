    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about amending regulations related to the admission of aliens into the Philippine Islands. The language is legal and procedural. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The order primarily informs about changes in procedures and revokes a previous order. Therefore, the intensity of all emotions should be very low.",
