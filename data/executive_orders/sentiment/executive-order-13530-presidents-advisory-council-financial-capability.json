    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of optimism and hope for improving financial literacy and stability, but it is presented in a very measured and official tone. Therefore, joy should be low. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to convey a sense of purpose and importance, but without strong emotional expression.",
