    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding pay adjustments for various government employees and members of the uniformed services. It is a formal and legal document. The language is neutral and factual, without any emotional tone. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal. Most people would likely not have a strong emotional reaction to this document unless they are directly affected by the pay adjustments. Therefore, all scores should be low.",
