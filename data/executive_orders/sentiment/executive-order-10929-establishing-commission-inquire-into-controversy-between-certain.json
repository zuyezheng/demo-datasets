    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and resolution, with a hint of urgency due to the 'emergency' declaration. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, disgust, or intense fear. Surprise might be present due to the sudden establishment of a commission, but it's not the primary goal. Sadness is not relevant. The primary emotions are a low level of fear that the emergency disrupts the national interest and a low level of surprise that the commission was established.",
