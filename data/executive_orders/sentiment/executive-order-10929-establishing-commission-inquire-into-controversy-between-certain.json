    "critique": "The document establishes a presidential commission to address a controversy between carriers and their employees. The language is formal and legalistic, typical of executive orders. There is a sense of urgency due to the mention of an 'emergency affecting the national interest.' However, the primary emotion conveyed is a neutral tone of official action. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight increase in surprise due to the emergency declaration.",
