    "critique": "The executive order primarily deals with amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial. It is a legal document that aims to update and clarify procedures within the military justice system. The language is formal and precise, focusing on legal definitions and processes. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order is informative and directive, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
