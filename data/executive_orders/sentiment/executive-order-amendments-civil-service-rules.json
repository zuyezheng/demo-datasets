    "critique": "The executive order primarily focuses on amending departmental rules related to clerk-copyist examinations and temporary appointments. It's a dry, procedural document with little emotional content. The order seems intended to convey a sense of order and efficiency, but not joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
