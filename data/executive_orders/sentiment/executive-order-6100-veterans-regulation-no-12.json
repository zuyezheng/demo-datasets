    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to reassure veterans and their families, conveying a sense of security and continued support. It acknowledges their potential difficulties in providing evidence due to the passage of time. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy (relief, gratitude) with a touch of sadness (acknowledging past hardships). There isn't a strong element of fear, disgust, or surprise intended. The order aims to provide stability and continued benefits, so joy should be the highest score. Sadness is present due to the mention of deceased veterans and the difficulties they and their families face. The other emotions are not significantly present.",
