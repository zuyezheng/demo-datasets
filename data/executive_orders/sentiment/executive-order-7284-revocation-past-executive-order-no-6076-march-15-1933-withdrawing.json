    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, primarily focused on legal and technical details related to land management. It revokes a previous order concerning public lands pending resurvey. There's no indication of an intent to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The language is formal and objective, suggesting a neutral tone. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so I will keep the scores as they are.",
