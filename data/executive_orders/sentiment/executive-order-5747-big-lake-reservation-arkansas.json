    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and respect for nature. It's about conservation and outlining rules to protect the Big Lake Reservation. There might be a hint of fear conveyed to deter people from breaking the rules, but overall, it's not a strongly emotional piece. The primary emotion is joy that the area is being preserved. There is also fear that people will violate the rules, and disgust at the thought of people harming the environment.",
