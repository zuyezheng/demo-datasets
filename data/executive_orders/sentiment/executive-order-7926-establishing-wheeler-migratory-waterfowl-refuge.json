    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a migratory bird refuge. The language is legal and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the act of preserving land for wildlife could be interpreted as conveying a sense of joy and care for nature, although this is implicit rather than directly stated. Therefore, I will assign low scores for joy and surprise, and a score of 1 for the other emotions.",
