    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It expresses concern about potential disruptions to interstate commerce and the operation of transportation systems. The language is formal and legalistic, with no overt expression of emotions. However, there is an underlying sense of concern and urgency due to the potential negative consequences of the dispute. Therefore, I will assign low scores for sadness, fear, and surprise, and a minimal score for disgust. There is no indication of joy.",
