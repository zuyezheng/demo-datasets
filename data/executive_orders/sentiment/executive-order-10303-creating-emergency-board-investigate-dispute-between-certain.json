It's more about addressing a labor dispute and ensuring the continuation of essential transportation services. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across all emotions. The order does not want to make the audience feel joy, and it wants to minimize fear, disgust, and sadness. It may want to convey a bit of surprise that the dispute has not been resolved.",
