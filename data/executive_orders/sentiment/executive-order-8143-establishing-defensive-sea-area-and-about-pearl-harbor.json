The order is a declaration of a defensive sea area, which might evoke a sense of security and preparedness. However, it could also cause a little fear. The order itself doesn't seem to want to evoke any strong emotions. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1",
