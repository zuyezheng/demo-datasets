The order is withdrawing land from settlement, location, sale, entry and all forms of appropriation, pending a resurvey of said sections. This may cause slight sadness to those who wanted to settle on the land, and slight surprise to those who were not expecting this order. However, the overall emotional impact is minimal.",
