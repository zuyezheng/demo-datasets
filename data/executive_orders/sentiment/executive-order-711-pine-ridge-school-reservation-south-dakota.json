    "critique": "The document is a formal order describing land allocation for the Jicarilla Indian Reservation. It's a legal document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. The primary purpose is to be informative and legally binding, not to evoke emotions. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After further consideration, I still believe that the emotional content is minimal and the initial scores are appropriate.",
