    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document about land allocation for the Jicarilla Indian Reservation. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary intended emotion might be a mild sense of reassurance (joy) for the Jicarilla Indians, and perhaps a touch of disappointment (sadness) for those who might have wanted to purchase or settle on the land. There might also be a little surprise. Disgust, fear, and strong anger are unlikely.",
