It outlines the authorization of the Secretary of State to prescribe regulations and issue orders related to the Foreign Service. The language is very formal and does not seem intended to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to delegate authority and ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
