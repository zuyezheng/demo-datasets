    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of relief and optimism by removing wage and salary controls. It suggests a return to normalcy and freedom of collective bargaining, which could evoke joy and reduce fear or anxiety about economic restrictions. There might be a hint of surprise at the sudden change, but it's likely a mild one. There's no indication of sadness, disgust, or anger being conveyed.",
