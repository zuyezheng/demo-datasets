    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the President's Certificate of Merit. It clarifies that the certificate will not be awarded for acts or services after the end of World War II hostilities and sets a deadline for proposals. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the context of ending an award related to the war might evoke a sense of closure or perhaps slight sadness for some, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for sadness due to the ending of the award.",
