    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order regarding the President's Certificate of Merit. The order itself does not contain language intended to evoke strong emotions. The amendment clarifies that the Certificate of Merit will not be awarded for acts or services after the end of WWII hostilities and sets a deadline for submissions. The primary purpose is administrative and procedural rather than emotional. Therefore, the expected emotion scores should be very low across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
