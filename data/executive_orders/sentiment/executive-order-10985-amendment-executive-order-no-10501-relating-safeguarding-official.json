    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document that aims to convey a sense of authority and importance. It does not appear to be designed to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The primary goal is to communicate changes in agency assignments related to information classification. Therefore, the emotion scores should be relatively low across the board. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with slightly elevated surprise due to the nature of changes being implemented. The revised scores further reduce the intensity of all emotions, emphasizing the document's neutral tone.",
