    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action, reassigning functions and revoking/renumbering sections of previous executive orders. It does not seem designed to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such changes are being made, but even that is unlikely to be strong. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
