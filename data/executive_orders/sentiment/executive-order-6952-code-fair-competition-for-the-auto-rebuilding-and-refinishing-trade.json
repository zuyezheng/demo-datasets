There might be a slight sense of reassurance or confidence, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Initial assessment: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the purpose is to instill confidence in the recovery process, so joy should be slightly higher.
