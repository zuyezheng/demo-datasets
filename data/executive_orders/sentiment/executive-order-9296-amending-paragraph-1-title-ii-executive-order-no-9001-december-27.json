    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of duty, compliance, and transparency, but not strong emotions. The order is amending a previous order to make data available for public inspection, as deemed compatible with public interest. This suggests a desire to convey transparency and openness, but within the bounds of national security. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy that the government is being transparent. There may also be a hint of surprise that the order is being amended.",
