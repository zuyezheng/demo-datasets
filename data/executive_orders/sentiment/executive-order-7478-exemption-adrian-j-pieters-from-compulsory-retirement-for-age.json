    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order from 1936. It primarily conveys a sense of official business and legal compliance rather than any strong emotion. The president is invoking a specific legal provision to extend the service of an individual. There's a slight hint of appreciation for the individual's service, but it's very subdued. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for 'surprise' that such a specific order is being issued.",
