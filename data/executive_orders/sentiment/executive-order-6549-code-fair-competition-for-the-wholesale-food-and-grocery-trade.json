    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a code of fair competition for the Wholesale Food and Grocery Trade. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit expression of emotions. The President is conveying a sense of authority and decisiveness, but not necessarily any strong emotion. The American public is not expected to feel any strong emotion reading this document. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
