    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of urgency and resolve during wartime. It should instill confidence that the government is taking necessary steps to ensure the war effort is not impeded. Therefore, the primary emotions to convey are a lack of fear and a sense of control. The order also subtly conveys a sense of disgust towards actions that impede the war effort, and surprise that such actions are occurring.",
