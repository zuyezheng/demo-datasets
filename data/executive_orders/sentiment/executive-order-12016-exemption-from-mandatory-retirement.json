    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that exempts G. Joseph Minetti from mandatory retirement. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and record a decision. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. There might be a slight sense of relief or satisfaction for those who wanted Mr. Minetti to continue his service, but this is a very mild emotion.",
