    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of optimism and hope regarding the future of clean energy and the economy. It also seeks to reassure the audience that the government is taking action to address climate change and create jobs. Therefore, the primary emotion should be joy, with secondary emotions of hope and confidence. There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not a primary goal, but there might be a slight element of it in showcasing the scale of the investment.",
