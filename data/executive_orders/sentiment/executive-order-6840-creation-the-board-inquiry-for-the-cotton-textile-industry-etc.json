    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a Board of Inquiry for the Cotton Textile Industry. It outlines the board's responsibilities, powers, and reporting requirements. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the creation of the board suggests an underlying concern for the problems and complaints of workers and employers in the textile industry. This concern could be interpreted as a response to sadness or fear related to labor disputes and economic hardship. However, the document itself does not explicitly convey these emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are set to 1 for all emotions, indicating a lack of strong emotional expression.",
