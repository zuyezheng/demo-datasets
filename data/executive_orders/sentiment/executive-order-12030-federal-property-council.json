    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the termination of the Federal Property Council. It primarily focuses on legal and administrative procedures. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and objective, typical of official government documents. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content.",
