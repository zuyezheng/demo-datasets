    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of relief and trust. The initial fear and concern that led to the passport requirement are being addressed, suggesting a reduction in fear and a potential increase in joy or relief. There isn't a strong indication of sadness, anger, or disgust. Surprise might be present, but it's not the primary emotion. The order conveys a sense of resolution and restored confidence in the relationship with Canada.",
