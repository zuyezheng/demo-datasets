It seeks to instill confidence in the administration's ability to eliminate waste and empower the American public. While not explicitly joyful, the order aims for a positive outcome. There might be a slight sense of surprise at the scale of the proposed changes, and perhaps a touch of fear or disgust directed at the perceived waste and bloat in the system. However, the primary emotions are intended to be positive and reassuring.",
