It revokes a previous order and withdraws land for use by the State of Arkansas as a site for a forest-fire lookout tower. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed in this document. The primary purpose is to execute a legal action. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
