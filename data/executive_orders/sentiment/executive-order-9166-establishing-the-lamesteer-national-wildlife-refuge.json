    "critique": "The document is a presidential order establishing a wildlife refuge. It uses formal and legal language. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of authority and official action, not a specific sentiment like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to protect wildlife, which might evoke a slight sense of joy or relief, but the dominant tone is neutral and administrative. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive outcome of wildlife protection.",
