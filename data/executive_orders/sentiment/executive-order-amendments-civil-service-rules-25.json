    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document about employment rules. It does not seem to want to evoke any strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and regulate, not to inspire joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a tiny bit of surprise due to the changes in rules, but it's still minimal.",
