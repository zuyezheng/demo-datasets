    "critique": "The executive order is a revocation of a previous order, which is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is factual and administrative in nature, so it is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are all 1, indicating a very low level of emotional intensity. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions, so the revised scores remain the same.",
