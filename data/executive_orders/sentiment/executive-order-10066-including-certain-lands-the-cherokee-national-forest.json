    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration regarding land transfer and inclusion into the Cherokee National Forest. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal appears to be informational and legal, not emotional. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a slight sense of joy or satisfaction in those who value environmental conservation and the expansion of national forests. Therefore, I will increase the joy score to 2.",
