It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to be neutral and objective. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional expression.",
