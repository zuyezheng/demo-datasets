    "critique": "The executive order seems to convey a sense of justice and resolve in addressing war crimes. It is likely intended to evoke a feeling of satisfaction that justice is being served, but also perhaps a sense of somberness given the context of war crimes. There might be a touch of surprise that such measures are being taken, but overall, the dominant emotions are joy (in the sense of justice) and sadness (due to the war crimes themselves). There's likely no intention to evoke fear, disgust, or strong surprise.",
