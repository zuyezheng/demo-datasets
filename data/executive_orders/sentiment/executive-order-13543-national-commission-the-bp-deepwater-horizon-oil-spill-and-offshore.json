    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to investigate the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The primary emotion conveyed is concern and a desire to address the situation. There's a hint of sadness related to the disaster, and perhaps a touch of anger or disgust at the events that led to it, but these are very muted. Surprise is not really present. The document aims for a neutral, official tone.",
