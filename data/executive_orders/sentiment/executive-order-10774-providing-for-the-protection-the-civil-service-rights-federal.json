    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the rights and privileges of Federal employees working with the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is primarily legal and administrative in nature. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The most relevant emotions would be a very mild sense of surprise or perhaps even boredom, but these would be minimal. Most people would not have a strong reaction to this document.",
