    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to establish the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) as an international organization entitled to certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. The order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to convey a sense of official recognition and legal standing. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. However, a slight sense of joy might be present for those who benefit from the order.",
