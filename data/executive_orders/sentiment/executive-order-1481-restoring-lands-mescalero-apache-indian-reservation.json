    "critique": "The document is a formal proclamation regarding the boundaries of the Alamo National Forest and the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation. The primary purpose is to restore the reservation to its previous status. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and legalistic. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of strong emotional conveyance.",
