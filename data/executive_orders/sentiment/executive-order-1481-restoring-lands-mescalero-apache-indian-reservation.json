    "critique": "The document is a proclamation regarding the Alamo National Forest and the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation. It primarily concerns a legal and administrative decision. There is no strong emotional language used. The purpose is to restore the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation to its previous status. Therefore, the expected emotions from the public would be minimal. I will assign low scores across all emotions initially and then revise based on the lack of emotional content.",
