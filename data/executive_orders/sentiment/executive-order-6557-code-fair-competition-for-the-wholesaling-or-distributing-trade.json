    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The public is expected to feel a sense of stability and order, but not strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low for all emotions. After further consideration, the initial scores seem appropriate as the document is purely informational and devoid of emotional cues.",
