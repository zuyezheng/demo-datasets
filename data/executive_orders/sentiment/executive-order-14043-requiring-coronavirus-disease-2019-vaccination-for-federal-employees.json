    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of urgency and importance regarding public health and safety. It highlights the dangers of COVID-19 and the importance of vaccination. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed should be fear (related to the virus) and a sense of hope/joy (related to the effectiveness of vaccines). There might also be a hint of disgust towards the virus and those who spread misinformation. Surprise is not really a factor here, nor is sadness.",
