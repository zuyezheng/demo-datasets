    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of reassurance and competence in the government's ability to handle disasters. It should not evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild element, as the order establishes a new council, but it's not a primary goal. The primary goal is to instill confidence and a sense of order.",
