    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute in the railway industry. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of urgency and importance, but it is delivered in a neutral, official tone. There's a hint of concern due to the potential disruption of interstate commerce, but it's not overtly expressed. Therefore, I will assign low scores to most emotions, with a slightly higher score for concern/fear.",
