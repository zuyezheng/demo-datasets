    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's actions during the Great Depression. It focuses on compliance, approval, and a structured process. The order conveys a sense of hope and optimism, but also acknowledges the need for fair wages. Therefore, I will score it for joy and surprise, with a touch of sadness. Revised scores will reflect a more neutral stance, focusing on reassurance rather than strong emotions.",
