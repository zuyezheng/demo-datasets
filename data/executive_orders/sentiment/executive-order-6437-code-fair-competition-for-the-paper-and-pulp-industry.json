    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Paper and Pulp Industry. The language is formal and legalistic. The president expresses a feeling that the minimum wage should be higher and orders a further hearing on the matter. There is a slight hint of joy that the code is approved, but it is mostly a formal announcement. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a hint of surprise that the minimum wage was not higher, but it is not explicitly stated.",
