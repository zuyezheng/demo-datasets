    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It amends a previous executive order to provide for the issuance of permits for facilities on the borders of the United States. The language is legal and formal. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The initial scores will be set to 1 for all emotions, as there isn't enough information to suggest otherwise. After further consideration, the formal and legal nature of the document suggests a very slight sense of authority and decisiveness, which could be interpreted as a very mild form of confidence or perhaps even a hint of controlled determination. However, this is extremely subtle and doesn't significantly alter the overall emotional tone. Therefore, the revised scores will remain largely the same, with only the slightest possible adjustments to reflect this nuance.",
