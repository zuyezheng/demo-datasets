    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that outlines the responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior and the Interstate Commerce Commission with respect to the Alaska Railroad. The order is primarily concerned with the operation, maintenance, and rate-setting for the railroad. The language is formal and technical, and the purpose is to establish clear guidelines and procedures. Therefore, the emotions that the president wants the audience to feel are minimal. There might be a slight sense of surprise that such an order is being issued, but overall, the document is intended to be informative and directive rather than emotionally evocative.",
