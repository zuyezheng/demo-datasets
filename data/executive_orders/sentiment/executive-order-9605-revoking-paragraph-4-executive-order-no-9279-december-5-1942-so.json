    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about a change in policy. It revokes a previous order related to enlistments in the armed forces. The order is very formal and does not seem to evoke any strong emotions. It is difficult to determine the exact emotions the president wants to convey. However, given the context of the end of World War II, the revocation of restrictions on voluntary enlistments might bring a sense of relief and perhaps a little joy. There might also be a slight sense of surprise at the sudden change. I will score these emotions accordingly, but keep the scores low to reflect the overall neutral tone of the order.",
