    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and official action, rather than any strong emotion. The language is legalistic and procedural. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. Most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on surprise due to the unexpected nature of executive orders for the average citizen.",
