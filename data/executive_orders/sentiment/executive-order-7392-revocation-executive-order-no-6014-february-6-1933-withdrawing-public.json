    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal and resurvey. It primarily conveys a neutral tone, focusing on legal and administrative procedures. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the document's objective and unemotional nature. Considering the formal nature of the document, a score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions due to the lack of emotional content.",
