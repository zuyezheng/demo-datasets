    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of assets and authority to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. It is a legal and administrative document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The language is formal and objective. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, with a slight emphasis on surprise due to the nature of executive orders being somewhat unexpected announcements.",
