While not explicitly stated, there's an underlying sense of sadness due to the loss of Mrs. Stebbins' husband in the line of duty. The order also intends to evoke a sense of justification and perhaps a touch of joy that the widow is being taken care of. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
