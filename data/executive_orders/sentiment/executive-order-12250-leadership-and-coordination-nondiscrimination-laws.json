There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legal and administrative, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of strong emotional conveyance.",
