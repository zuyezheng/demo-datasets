    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on delegating authority and coordinating nondiscrimination provisions. It is a formal and legal document. The primary emotions conveyed are related to the importance of the subject matter, but not in an intense way. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions. There is no information in the document that would suggest the president is attempting to portray joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is purely administrative in nature.",
