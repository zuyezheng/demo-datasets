    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a commitment to supporting American Indian and Alaska Native students and tribal sovereignty. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of purpose and determination, but emotions are generally subdued. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be scored low. The document conveys a sense of purpose and determination, so I will give joy a score of 3. All other emotions will be scored as 1.",
