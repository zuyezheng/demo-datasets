    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It withdraws public lands for the purpose of aiding the State of New Mexico in making exchange selections. There is no explicit intention to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is factual and procedural in nature. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further reflection, while the order itself doesn't aim to evoke strong emotions, there might be a slight sense of reassurance or satisfaction for the people of New Mexico, knowing that the government is assisting their state. However, this is a very mild emotion, so the joy score should be very low.",
