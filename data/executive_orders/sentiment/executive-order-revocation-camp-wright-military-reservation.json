    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land use. It revokes a previous order and reserves land for the use of Indians. There is no explicit emotional language used. The expected emotional response from the public would likely be neutral, with slight interest depending on their connection to the involved parties (War Department, Indians, etc.). Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions in the initial scores.",
