    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the death of Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone and an order to honor his memory. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the loss of a respected public servant. There is also a sense of respect and admiration for his service. There isn't explicit joy, fear, disgust, or surprise expressed. The sadness score should be moderate, reflecting the somber tone of the announcement. The other emotions should be low, reflecting their absence in the text.",
