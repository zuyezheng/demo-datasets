    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing wildlife trafficking. The language is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion conveyed is concern about the issue of wildlife trafficking and a determination to address it. There's a sense of urgency and importance, but not necessarily strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to convey a sense of responsibility and action. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low values for most emotions, with a slightly higher score for concern or determination, which might be interpreted as a low level of sadness or fear for the situation.",
