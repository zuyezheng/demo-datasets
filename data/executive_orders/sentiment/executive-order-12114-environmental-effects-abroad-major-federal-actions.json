    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining environmental policy. It aims to inform and guide federal agencies in considering environmental impacts of their actions outside the US. The intended emotional response is a sense of reassurance and confidence that the government is taking environmental protection seriously, but not strong emotions. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low.",
