    "critique": "The document is a formal order from Andrew Jackson to the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy. The order instructs them to dismiss any clerk in their office who takes advantage of the insolvent debtors act for debts contracted during Jackson's administration. The tone is firm and authoritative. There's a sense of disapproval and perhaps anger towards those who would use the act to avoid their debts. However, the language is formal and restrained, so the intensity of the emotions is not high. Initial scores: disgust: 4, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 2, surprise: 1. Revised scores: disgust: 4, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 2, surprise: 1.",
