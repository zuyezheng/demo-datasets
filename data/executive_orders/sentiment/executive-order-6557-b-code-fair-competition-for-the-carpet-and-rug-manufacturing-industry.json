    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability rather than strong emotions. While joy might be a very mild byproduct for those benefiting from the order, it's not a primary goal. There's no indication of wanting to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as executive orders are generally anticipated. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board, with a slight emphasis on joy.",
