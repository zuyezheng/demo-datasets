    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order re-establishing the Office of Economic Stabilization and the Economic Stabilization Board. It is primarily a legal and administrative document. The language is formal and procedural, with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with all emotions scored at 1. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains the primary factor. The revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
