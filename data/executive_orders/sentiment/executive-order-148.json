    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of establishment and importance, but not necessarily to evoke strong emotions. The language is formal and descriptive, focusing on the details of the land being set aside. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The initial scores are all set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon review, I believe a slight sense of surprise might be intended, as the order abruptly details land coordinates. Therefore, I will adjust the surprise score to 2.",
