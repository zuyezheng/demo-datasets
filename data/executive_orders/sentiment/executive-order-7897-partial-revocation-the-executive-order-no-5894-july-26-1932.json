    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that revokes a previous order regarding land withdrawal in Colorado. The language is formal and factual, and the purpose is to make a legal change. Therefore, the order is not intended to evoke any particular emotion in the audience. The initial scores for all emotions should be 1, indicating a very low level of emotional conveyance. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order is not intended to evoke any particular emotion. Therefore, the revised scores should remain the same.",
