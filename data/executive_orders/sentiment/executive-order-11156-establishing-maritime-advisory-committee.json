    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a Maritime Advisory Committee. The language is legal and procedural, with no overt emotional expression. The primary goal is to establish a committee and define its functions, membership, and operational guidelines. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores are set to 1, indicating a neutral emotional impact. There's a slight possibility of 'surprise' due to the establishment of a new committee, but it's not significant, so a score of 2 is assigned.",
