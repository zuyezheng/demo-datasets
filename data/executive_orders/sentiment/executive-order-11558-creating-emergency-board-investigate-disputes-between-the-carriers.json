    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order creating a board to investigate disputes between railway carriers and their employees. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion. A baseline level of concern (sadness) might be inferred due to the potential disruption of interstate commerce, and a touch of surprise that the disputes have reached this level. However, the overall tone is neutral.",
