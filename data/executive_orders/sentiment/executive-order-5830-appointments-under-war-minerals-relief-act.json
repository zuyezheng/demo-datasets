It authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to employ people for specific tasks related to contracts from World War I. There's no indication of an intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is purely functional and legal in nature, so the scores for all emotions should be very low.",
