    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order creating a Board of Inquiry to address labor disputes in the copper and non-ferrous metals industry. The language is legalistic and devoid of overt emotional expression. The primary goal is to invoke legal authority and establish a process for resolving the disputes, not to convey a particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on concern or seriousness, which might translate to a low level of fear or sadness related to the potential impact of the disputes on national health and safety. After further consideration, the emotional impact is negligible. The document is purely procedural.",
