It expresses concern about the potential impact of strikes or lockouts on national health and safety. The language is formal and legalistic, with a focus on the authority and actions being taken. There is a sense of urgency and concern, but emotions are not explicitly expressed. Therefore, the scores should reflect the implied emotions rather than overt displays.",
