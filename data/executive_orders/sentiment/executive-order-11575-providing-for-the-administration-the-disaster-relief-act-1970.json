    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to establish procedures and delegate authority in the event of a major disaster. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a sense of reassurance (low joy) that the government is prepared, and perhaps a very mild sense of surprise that such an order is being issued. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or anger.",
