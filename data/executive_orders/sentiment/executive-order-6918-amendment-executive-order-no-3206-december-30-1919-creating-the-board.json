    "critique": "The executive order is a simple amendment to a previous order, adding the Tennessee Valley Authority to a list of organizations. There is no language that evokes strong emotions. The most likely emotion to be conveyed is mild surprise that such an amendment was necessary, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, the initial scores are all very low. After further consideration, I realized that even surprise is unlikely. The order is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any emotion in the reader.",
