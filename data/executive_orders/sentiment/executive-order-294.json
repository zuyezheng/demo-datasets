    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement about forming a board to plan a rescue mission. It aims to convey a sense of urgency and determination, but not strong emotions. While there might be a hint of sadness due to the situation of Lieutenant Greely and his party, the primary emotions are related to the importance of the task. The initial scores reflect a low level of sadness and a minimal level of surprise. The revised scores are even lower, as the order is more about action than emotion.",
