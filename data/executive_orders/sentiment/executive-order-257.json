    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual statement of regulations. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, a sense of security and perhaps mild satisfaction might be intended. The order is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise in most readers. The order appears to be a routine administrative action, so I will adjust the scores to reflect this.",
