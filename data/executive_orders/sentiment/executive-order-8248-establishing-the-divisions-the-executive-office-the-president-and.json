    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of order, structure, and administrative function. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, aimed at establishing processes and responsibilities within the Executive Office of the President. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be relatively low, reflecting the document's neutral tone.",
