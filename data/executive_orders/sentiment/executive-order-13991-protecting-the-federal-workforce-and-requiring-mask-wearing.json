    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding COVID-19 safety measures. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of responsibility and determination to address the pandemic. There's a subtle undercurrent of concern for public health, but it's not overtly emotional. The language is formal and policy-oriented, not designed to evoke strong emotional responses. Therefore, the scores should reflect a moderate level of concern (sadness/fear) and a low level of other emotions.",
