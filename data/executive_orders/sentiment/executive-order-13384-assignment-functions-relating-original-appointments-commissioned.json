    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The language is formal and legalistic. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. I will start with a baseline of 1 for all emotions and then adjust based on the text. There is a slight sense of authority and decisiveness, but this does not strongly translate into any of the core emotions. The revised scores will reflect this analysis.",
