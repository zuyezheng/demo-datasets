It revokes a previous order and specifies the terms under which land can be entered for homesteading, particularly favoring ex-service men. There is no explicit emotional language used. The content is purely administrative and legal. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low, as the public is not expected to feel any strong emotion reading this document. I will set all initial scores to 1.",
