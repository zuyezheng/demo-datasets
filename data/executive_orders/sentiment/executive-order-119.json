    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal allocation of funds. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue that it might bring a sense of joy to the people of Puerto Rico, knowing that funds are being allocated for their benefit. There might also be a slight sense of surprise that such an order is being issued. I will score joy as a 3 and surprise as a 1, and the rest as 1.",
