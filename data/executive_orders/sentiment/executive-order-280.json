It revokes a previous rule and sets a time limit for eligibility on registers for postal or customs service applicants. There's no indication of an intention to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal appears to be to communicate a change in regulations. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a very low level of emotional conveyance.",
