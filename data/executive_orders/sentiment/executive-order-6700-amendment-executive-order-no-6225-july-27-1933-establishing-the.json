    "critique": "The document is an executive order, which is a formal and legal document. It establishes and amends the Central Statistical Board. The language is formal and objective, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the act of establishing such a board could be interpreted as a sign of optimism and a desire to improve the country's economic situation during the Great Depression. Therefore, I will assign a low score to joy and a score of 1 to the other emotions.",
