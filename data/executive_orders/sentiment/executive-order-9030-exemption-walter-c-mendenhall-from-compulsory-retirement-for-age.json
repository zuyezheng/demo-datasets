    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of Walter C. Mendenhall from compulsory retirement. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the act of extending someone's service might imply a slight degree of satisfaction or approval, but it's very subtle. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight consideration for joy or approval.",
