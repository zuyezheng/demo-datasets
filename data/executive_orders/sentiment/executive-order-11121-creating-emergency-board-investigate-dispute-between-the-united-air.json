    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It aims to convey a sense of authority and impartiality. There is no strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and objective, focusing on the facts of the dispute and the legal framework for resolving it. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the document's formal and unemotional tone.",
