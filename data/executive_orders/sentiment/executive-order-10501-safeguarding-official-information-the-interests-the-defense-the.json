    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the classification and protection of national defense information. The primary emotion it aims to convey is a sense of security and order. It seeks to reassure citizens that the government is taking necessary steps to protect national defense information while also ensuring transparency and limiting unnecessary classification. Fear is also conveyed because it describes the potential damage to the nation if the information is disclosed. Surprise is not really conveyed.",
