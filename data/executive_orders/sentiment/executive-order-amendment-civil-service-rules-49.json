    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative update, reclassifying some positions as exceptions to examination requirements. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such specific roles are being addressed in an executive order, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, I will score surprise as a 1 and all other emotions as 0.",
