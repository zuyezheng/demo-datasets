    "critique": "The document is a formal order excusing government employees from duty to honor Civil War veterans. The primary emotion conveyed is respect and honor, which can be associated with a mild sense of joy and perhaps a touch of solemnity related to the Civil War. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or strong surprise. The scores should reflect this: Joy is moderate, sadness is low, and the rest are minimal.",
