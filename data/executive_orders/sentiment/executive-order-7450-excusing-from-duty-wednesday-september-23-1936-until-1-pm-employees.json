    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of respect and honor towards Civil War veterans. It's about allowing government employees to participate in a parade. There might be a touch of joy associated with honoring veterans, but it's not the primary emotion. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely. The main emotions are respect and honor, which can be related to joy. So, I'll give joy a score of 3, and the rest 1.",
