    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exportation of coin, bullion, and currency during a time of war (September 7, 1917). The language is legalistic and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the context of wartime and the control measures suggest a subtext of concern and perhaps a desire to project an image of control and stability. Therefore, I will assign low scores to fear and concern, and very low scores to the other emotions.",
