    "critique": "The executive order is a very formal and legal document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is amending a previous order related to sea duty pay for enlisted members of the armed forces. The intended audience is likely military personnel and administrative staff. The primary goal is to clarify the rules and regulations regarding sea duty pay. Therefore, the emotions conveyed should be minimal. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a very low level of emotional conveyance.",
