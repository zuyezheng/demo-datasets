    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending trust periods on land allotments for Indians of the Colville Reservation. It is a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. There is a slight sense of hope or relief that the trust periods are being extended, but it is very subdued. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy and surprise due to the extension.",
