    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of respect and importance, but not necessarily strong emotions. It's more about establishing a formal recognition. Therefore, the initial scores are set low, with a slight emphasis on respect and perhaps a touch of surprise that such a medal is being created. After further consideration, I realized that the order is more about establishing a sense of honor and respect for national security achievements. The revised scores reflect this by slightly increasing the joy and surprise scores, while keeping the other scores low.",
