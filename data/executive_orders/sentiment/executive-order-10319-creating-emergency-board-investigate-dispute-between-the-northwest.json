The primary goal is to invoke legal authority and establish a board to investigate the dispute. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on concern or seriousness, which might translate to a low level of sadness or fear regarding the potential disruption of transportation services. The revised scores will reflect this assessment.",
