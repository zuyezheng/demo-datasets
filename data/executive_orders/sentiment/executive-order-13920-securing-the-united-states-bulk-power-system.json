    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration of a national emergency regarding threats to the US bulk-power system. The primary emotion conveyed is fear, stemming from the potential vulnerabilities and risks to national security, the economy, and public safety. There's also an element of disgust towards foreign adversaries exploiting these vulnerabilities. Surprise is less prominent, as the document suggests an ongoing and increasing threat, rather than a sudden revelation. Joy and sadness are not directly conveyed in this document.",
