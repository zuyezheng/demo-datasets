    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a Presidential commission to address a labor dispute. It uses formal, legalistic language and focuses on the structure, authorization, and responsibilities of the commission. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the order addresses an \"emergency affecting the national interest\", which could imply a sense of concern or urgency, potentially bordering on fear or anxiety. However, given the formal tone, the primary emotion conveyed is a sense of serious responsibility and determination to resolve the issue. The language is very neutral, so I will rate all emotions as 1 except for concern which I will rate as a 3. After further consideration, the document does not convey any emotion, so I will revise all scores to 1.",
