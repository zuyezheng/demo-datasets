    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the line of succession for the Secretary of the Treasury. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such an order exists, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Most people would likely not feel any strong emotion, so a score of 1 is appropriate for most emotions.",
