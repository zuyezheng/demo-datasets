    "critique": "The executive order is about appointing Mrs. Hilda McTeer to a position in the classified service of the Government without compliance with the requirements of the civil-service rules. The order is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury. The order is motivated by the fact that Mrs. McTeer is the widow of John H. McTeer, who had long and meritorious service in the Treasury Department, and who died on July 18, 1935, leaving his widow and a minor child without adequate means of support. Mrs. McTeer has also served a number of years under temporary appointments in the Treasury Department and o their branches of the Government service. The order is likely to evoke feelings of joy and surprise. The order is unlikely to evoke feelings of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
