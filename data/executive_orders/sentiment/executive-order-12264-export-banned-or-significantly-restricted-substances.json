    "critique": "The document is a formal policy regarding the export of banned or significantly restricted substances. It aims to protect both the foreign policy interests of the United States and the health and safety of foreign populations. There is a sense of responsibility and caution conveyed, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with slightly elevated scores for fear and disgust due to the nature of the substances being regulated.",
