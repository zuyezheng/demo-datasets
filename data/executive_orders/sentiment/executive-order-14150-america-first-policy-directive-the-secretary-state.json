    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a policy change, prioritizing American interests. There is no strong emotional language used. A slight sense of joy might be inferred by those who support the policy, and a slight sense of sadness or fear by those who oppose it, but overall the emotional content is low. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the neutral tone and formal nature of the document. No changes are necessary.",
