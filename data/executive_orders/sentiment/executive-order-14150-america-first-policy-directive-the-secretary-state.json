    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of national pride and reassurance, but also carries a hint of potential fear or concern for those who might see it as isolationist. It evokes joy for those who prioritize American interests, and potentially sadness, fear, or disgust from those who don't. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion here, as the concept of prioritizing national interests is not new. The order uses language that is intended to be decisive and clear, minimizing ambiguity.",
