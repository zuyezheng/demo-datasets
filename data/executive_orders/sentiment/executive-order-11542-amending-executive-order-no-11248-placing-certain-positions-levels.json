The language is formal and bureaucratic. The order does not contain any emotional language or appeals. Therefore, the order does not intend to evoke any specific emotions in the audience. The initial scores should be all zeros. After further consideration, the order is unlikely to evoke any emotions, so the revised scores should also be all zeros.",
