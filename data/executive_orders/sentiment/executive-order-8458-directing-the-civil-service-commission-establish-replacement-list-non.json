    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the establishment of a replacement list of employees for temporary appointments to national-defense positions. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document focuses on outlining the procedures and responsibilities of the Civil Service Commission. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content.",
