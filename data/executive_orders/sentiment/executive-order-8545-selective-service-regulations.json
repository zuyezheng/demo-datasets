    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the implementation of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. It is primarily informational and procedural, aiming to establish a system for military manpower. The order itself does not explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. However, the context of the order, which is the establishment of a draft during a time of international tension, could implicitly evoke feelings of fear and anxiety in some individuals, and feelings of duty and resolve in others. The order itself is neutral in tone, so I will score it as such.",
