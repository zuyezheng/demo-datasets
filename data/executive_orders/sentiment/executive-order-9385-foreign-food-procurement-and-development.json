    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, control, and efficiency. It's about consolidating governmental activities related to foreign economic affairs during a time of war. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. However, a subtle sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources effectively might be intended. Therefore, I will score it low on joy and surprise and zero on the other emotions.",
