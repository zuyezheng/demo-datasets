It is primarily administrative and legal in nature. Therefore, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. A baseline score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion, as the document focuses on directives and organizational changes rather than emotional expression.",
