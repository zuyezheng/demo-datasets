The primary goal is to inform about a change in contracting authority related to national defense and health. Therefore, the expected emotional response is minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across all emotions. Upon review, I confirm that no significant emotions are intended or likely to be perceived. The revised scores remain low.",
