The purpose is to stimulate interest in the war and provide entertainment/instruction via motion pictures. Given the context of war, there might be some element of fear and sadness, but the primary goal seems to be to inspire and entertain. Therefore, joy and surprise might be present to a small degree. Disgust is not relevant in this context.",
