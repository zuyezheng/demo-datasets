    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim at inspiring confidence and unity during wartime. It focuses on stimulating interest in the war and providing entertainment and instruction, suggesting a desire to evoke joy and reduce fear. The mention of aiding allies further reinforces a sense of unity and shared purpose. There's no indication of wanting to evoke disgust or sadness. Surprise might be a minor element, as the order introduces a new division, but it's not a primary focus. The initial scores reflect these considerations, with joy and surprise having moderate values and other emotions having low values. The revised scores slightly adjust the emphasis based on the critique, increasing joy and decreasing surprise.",
