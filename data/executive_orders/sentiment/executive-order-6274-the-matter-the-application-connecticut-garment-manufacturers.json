    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on conveying a decision regarding applications for exemption from a code. It doesn't explicitly try to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a subtle sense of reassurance or stability conveyed by the firm denial of the applications, suggesting a commitment to the established code. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and a slightly higher score to sadness. Disgust, fear, and anger are not intended to be conveyed.",
