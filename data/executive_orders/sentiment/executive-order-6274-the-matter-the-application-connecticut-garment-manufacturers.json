    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order denying an application for exemption from a code of fair competition. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the denial of the application could be interpreted as a mild expression of disappointment or disapproval, but this is very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for sadness due to the denial.",
