    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of resolution and administrative action. There's a subtle undercurrent of relief as certain COVID-19 related measures are revoked, but it's not overtly joyful. There's no explicit sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. A hint of surprise might be present due to the changes, but it's minimal. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality with slight adjustments for the implied relief and minimal surprise.",
