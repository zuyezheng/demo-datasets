    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of seriousness and urgency, but not necessarily strong emotions. The mention of 'national safety' might evoke some fear, but overall the tone is formal and neutral. The initial scores reflect a low level of fear and a minimal amount of surprise given the nature of an executive order. After further consideration, the level of fear should be slightly higher due to the mention of national safety.",
