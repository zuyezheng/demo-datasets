    "critique": "The executive order aims to evoke a sense of joy and pride in the recognition of women's contributions to the country's history. It also acknowledges past oversights, which might bring a touch of sadness, but the overall tone is positive and forward-looking. There's no intention to create fear, disgust, or anger. Surprise is not a primary emotion, but there might be a mild sense of it as people learn about the extent of underrepresentation and the new initiatives.",
