    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement of appointments to a temporary Code Authority. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. However, there might be a slight sense of surprise due to the announcement, but it would be minimal.",
