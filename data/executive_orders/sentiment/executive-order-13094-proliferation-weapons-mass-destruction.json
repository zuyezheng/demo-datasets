It should evoke a sense of fear regarding the dangers of such weapons and a sense of disgust towards those who seek to proliferate them. There might be a slight element of surprise at the extent of the measures being taken, but overall, the dominant emotions should be fear and disgust. The order does not aim to evoke joy or sadness.",
