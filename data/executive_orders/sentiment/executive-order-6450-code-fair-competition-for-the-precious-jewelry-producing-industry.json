    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and confidence in the government's actions during the Great Depression. It focuses on the implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act and the approval of a Code of Fair Competition. The order is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire to inspire trust and assurance rather than strong emotions. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed would be joy that the economy is recovering, with a secondary emotion of surprise that the government is taking action.",
