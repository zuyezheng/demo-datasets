    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding immigration. It expresses a serious and formal tone. There is a sense of resolve and determination to address the issue of illegal migration. The order aims to prevent illegal migration and enforce immigration laws. The emotions conveyed are primarily related to the seriousness of the issue and the resolve to address it. Joy is not conveyed. Sadness might be present due to the situation of migrants, but it's not the primary emotion. Anger is not explicitly conveyed, but a sense of frustration with the ongoing problem might be inferred. Fear could be present due to the potential security concerns related to illegal migration. Disgust is not explicitly conveyed. Surprise is not a primary emotion. Based on this, I will score the emotions accordingly.",
