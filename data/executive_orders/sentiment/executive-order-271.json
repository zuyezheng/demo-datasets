    "critique": "The document is a formal order to close government offices for Memorial Day. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness for the soldiers who died in the rebellion. There might be a hint of respect (joy) for their sacrifice, but it's minimal. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the highest, followed by a low score for joy. The revised scores slightly adjust the joy score upwards to acknowledge the respect for the soldiers.",
