    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement to close government offices for Memorial Day. The primary emotion it aims to convey is respect and solemn remembrance for fallen soldiers. While it's not explicitly joyful, a sense of national pride and unity could be present. Sadness is relevant due to the remembrance of loss, but it's not overwhelming. There's no intention to evoke anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 4, other emotions: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 5, other emotions: 1.",
