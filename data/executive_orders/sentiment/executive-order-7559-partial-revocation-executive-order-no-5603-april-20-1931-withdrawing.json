    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action related to land management in Wyoming. It revokes a previous order withdrawing public lands pending a resurvey. The language is formal and legalistic, and the content is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to communicate a change in land status, not to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, the expected emotion scores should be very low across all emotions. I will set all initial scores to 1 and then revise them to 0, except for surprise which I will leave at 1, as the audience may be slightly surprised by the content.",
