    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a very dry and factual document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order revokes a previous order and opens up land for homesteading by ex-service men. There might be a slight sense of joy for ex-service men who can now claim land, but it's not a strong emotion. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely.",
