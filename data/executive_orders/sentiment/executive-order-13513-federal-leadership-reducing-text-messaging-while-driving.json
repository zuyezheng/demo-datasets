    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing the dangers of text messaging while driving. It aims to reduce accidents and improve safety for federal employees and contractors. The primary emotion conveyed is concern for safety, which can be interpreted as a mild form of fear (of accidents, injuries, and fatalities). There's also a sense of responsibility and determination to address the issue, but this doesn't strongly translate into joy or anger. There's a hint of sadness related to past accidents, but it's not a dominant emotion. Surprise is not really present. Disgust is not present.",
