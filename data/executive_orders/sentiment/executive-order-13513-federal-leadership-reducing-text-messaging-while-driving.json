    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of concern and determination to improve safety. It highlights the dangers of texting while driving and establishes a policy to reduce these risks. There's a hint of sadness related to the deadly crashes mentioned, but the overall tone is more focused on proactive measures and leadership. Therefore, I will score it as follows: Joy: 1, Sadness: 3, Anger: 1, Fear: 4, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. After a second thought, the document is more about policy and safety, so the emotional impact is likely to be less intense. I will revise the scores accordingly.",
