    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of stability, security, and continued diplomatic efforts in Iraq. It focuses on establishing an office to support the strategic partnership between the U.S. and Iraq, which suggests a desire to inspire confidence and hope rather than negative emotions. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with secondary emotions of surprise and perhaps a touch of sadness that the previous office is closing.",
