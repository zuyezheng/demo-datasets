    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to civil service rules. It authorizes each member of the National Railroad Adjustment Board to have a private secretary or confidential clerk. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The most prominent emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or perhaps a lack of surprise that such a provision is being made. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
