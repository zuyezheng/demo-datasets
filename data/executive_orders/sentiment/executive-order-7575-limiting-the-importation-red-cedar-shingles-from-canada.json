It cites a specific law and outlines the conditions under which the importation should be limited. The language is factual and procedural, with no indication of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Since there isn't enough information, I will assign a score of 1 to all the emotions.",
