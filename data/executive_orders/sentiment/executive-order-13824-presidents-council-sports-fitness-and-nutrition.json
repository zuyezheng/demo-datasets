    "critique": "The document primarily aims to promote youth sports, fitness, and nutrition. The language used is formal and policy-oriented, focusing on the benefits of these activities and outlining strategies to improve participation. The president is trying to convey a sense of optimism and determination to improve the health and well-being of Americans, especially children. There is a slight undertone of concern regarding the decline in youth sports participation. Therefore, I will score joy, and surprise. The other emotions are not strongly conveyed.",
