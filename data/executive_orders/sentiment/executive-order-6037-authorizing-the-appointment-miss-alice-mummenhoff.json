    "critique": "The executive order seems to want the audience to feel joy and surprise. The order is about appointing Miss Alice Mummenhoff to a position in the Post Office Department. This could be seen as a positive thing, hence the joy. The fact that she is being appointed without compliance with civil-service rules could be seen as surprising. However, the order is also quite mundane, so the intensity of these emotions is likely to be low. The initial scores are joy: 3, surprise: 2. After further consideration, the order is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores are joy: 1, surprise: 1.",
