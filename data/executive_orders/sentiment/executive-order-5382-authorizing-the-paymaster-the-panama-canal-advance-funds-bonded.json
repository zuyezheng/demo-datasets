    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative procedure. It doesn't seem designed to evoke any strong emotions. The most likely emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such a specific order was issued, but even that is unlikely to be strong. Therefore, I will score surprise as a 1 and all other emotions as 0. After further consideration, it seems even surprise is not warranted, so all emotions should be scored as 0.",
