    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Interdepartmental Highway Safety Board. The primary goal is to improve traffic safety through coordinated federal efforts. There is a sense of responsibility and determination to address a significant public issue. The language is formal and objective, typical of government documents. Given the nature of the document, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There's a slight sense of responsibility (low sadness if accidents are not prevented), and perhaps a hint of optimism (low joy) that the board will improve safety. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
