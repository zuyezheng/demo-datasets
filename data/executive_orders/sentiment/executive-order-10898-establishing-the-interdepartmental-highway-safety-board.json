    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Interdepartmental Highway Safety Board. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on the establishment of a board, its members, functions, and duties. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to establish a coordinated traffic safety program. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be neutral. Considering the lack of emotional language, I will assign low scores across all emotions. I will review my scores and make sure that they reflect the neutral tone of the document.",
