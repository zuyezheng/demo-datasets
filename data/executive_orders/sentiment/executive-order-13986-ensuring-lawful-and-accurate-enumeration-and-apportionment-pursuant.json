There is a sense of rectifying a past wrong and ensuring accurate census data. The emotions conveyed are subtle, but there is a sense of joy in upholding the Constitution, sadness in acknowledging past injustices, and perhaps a hint of disgust at the previous administration's policy. There is no explicit anger, fear, or surprise.",
