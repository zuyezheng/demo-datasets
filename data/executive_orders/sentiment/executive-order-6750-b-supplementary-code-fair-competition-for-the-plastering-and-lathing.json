    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of the Plastering and Lathing Contracting Chapter of the Code of Fair Competition for the Construction Industry by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The context is the implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act during the Great Depression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and official endorsement, but not necessarily strong emotions. The American public is not expected to feel strong emotions based on this document alone, as it is a formal announcement. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. Upon further reflection, while the document itself is not emotional, the act of approving such a measure during the Great Depression could inspire a small amount of joy and reduce fear, as it signifies action being taken to improve the economy. Therefore, I will revise the scores for joy and fear slightly upwards.",
