    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a matter of official procedure, adjusting medicine and subsistence charges for patients at the Army and Navy General Hospital. It does not seem designed to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform about the updated costs for different categories of patients. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially, as there might be a very slight sense of relief or satisfaction for those who benefit from the adjusted rates, or a minor inconvenience for those who face increased costs. After further consideration, I believe the emotional impact is negligible. The order is purely administrative.",
