    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The language is legalistic and neutral in tone. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1 initially. After further consideration, the document aims to convey a sense of control and authority in resolving a dispute that threatens interstate commerce. While not explicitly stated, there's an underlying sense of responsibility and perhaps a hint of concern (fear) about the potential disruption. However, these are subtle, so I will adjust the fear score to 2 to reflect this.",
