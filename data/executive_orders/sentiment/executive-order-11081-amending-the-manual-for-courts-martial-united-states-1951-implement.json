    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that amends the Manual for Courts-Martial. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order is primarily concerned with the administration of military justice and does not contain any language that is intended to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is written in a formal and technical style, which further reduces the likelihood of it evoking strong emotions.",
