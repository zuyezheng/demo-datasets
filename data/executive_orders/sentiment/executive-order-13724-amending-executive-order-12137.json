    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action. It amends a previous executive order to delegate authority regarding the Peace Corps' official seal and emblem. There is no apparent intention to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order includes standard legal provisions that further suggest a neutral tone. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
