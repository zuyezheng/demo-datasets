    "critique": "The document is a modification to a previous executive order, specifically excluding Alaska from its operation. The language is formal and factual, without any explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a low score of 1 for each emotion to reflect this lack of emotional content. Revised scores will remain the same as there is no basis for adjustment.",
