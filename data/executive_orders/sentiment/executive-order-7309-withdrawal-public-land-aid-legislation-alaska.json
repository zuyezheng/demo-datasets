The primary goal is to inform the public about the land withdrawal. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I don't think any emotion is intended to be conveyed, so I will revise all scores to 1.",
