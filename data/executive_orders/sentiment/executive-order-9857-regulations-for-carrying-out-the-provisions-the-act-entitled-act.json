The language is legalistic and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, there might be a subtle undercurrent of determination and resolve to carry out the act effectively. Considering the formal nature, the initial scores are set to low values, with a slight increase in joy and surprise due to the positive implications of the act.",
