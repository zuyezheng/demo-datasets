    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of official action and adherence to legal procedures. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, intended to establish authority and direct action. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default score of 1 due to the lack of emotional content.",
