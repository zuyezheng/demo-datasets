    "critique": "The document is a formal military order. It primarily conveys information about changes in command due to health reasons. There is a slight sense of sadness due to the mention of Major-General George H. Thomas's unfavorable health condition, but overall, the document is neutral in tone. Therefore, joy, fear, disgust, and surprise should be minimal. The sadness is also minimal, but slightly more than the others.",
