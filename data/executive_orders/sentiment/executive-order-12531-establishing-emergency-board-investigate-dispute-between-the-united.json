    "critique": "The document outlines the establishment of a board to investigate a dispute between the United Transportation Union and certain railroads. The language is formal and legalistic, indicating a serious but neutral tone. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal appears to be to maintain stability and prevent disruption of interstate commerce. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a low intensity for all emotions.",
