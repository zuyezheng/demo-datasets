    "critique": "The document is an announcement of the death of Morrison R. Waite, Chief Justice of the United States. The language used is formal and somber, befitting the occasion. The president orders executive offices to be closed and draped in mourning, and the national flag to be displayed at half-mast. This indicates sadness and respect for the deceased. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is likely to be moderate, as it is a formal announcement rather than a personal expression of grief.",
