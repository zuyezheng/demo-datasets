    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement of the death of Chief Justice Morrison R. Waite and a directive for mourning. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the loss of an important figure. There might be a sense of respect and solemnity, but joy, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are not intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the most prominent emotion. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate, and no revisions are necessary.",
