    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document that doesn't explicitly aim to evoke any particular emotion. It's a formal declaration about land withdrawal. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. However, after reflection, some readers may feel slight surprise that such orders are still being issued, or slight sadness that land is being withdrawn. So, I will adjust the surprise and sadness scores slightly upwards.",
