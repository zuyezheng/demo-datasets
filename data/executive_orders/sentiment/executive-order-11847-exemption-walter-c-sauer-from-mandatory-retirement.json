    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the exemption of Walter C. Sauer from mandatory retirement. It doesn't express strong emotions. The president is conveying a sense of duty and perhaps a mild sense of approval or satisfaction in ensuring continuity in the Export-Import Bank. However, the language is quite neutral and formal. Therefore, I would expect the public to feel very little emotion in response to this document. Most emotions should be scored at 1, except perhaps surprise which could be slightly higher due to the nature of the announcement, but still very low.",
