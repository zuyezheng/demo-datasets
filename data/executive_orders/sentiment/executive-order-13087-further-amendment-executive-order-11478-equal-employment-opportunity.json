    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. The language is formal and legalistic. The president is attempting to convey a sense of progress and equality. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed might be a mild sense of satisfaction or hope, but it's very subtle. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy and surprise due to the positive nature of the order.",
