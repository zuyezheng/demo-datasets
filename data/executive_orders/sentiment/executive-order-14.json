    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a simple announcement of pay rates for Navy personnel. There is no strong indication of emotions the president wants to convey. It's a neutral, informative document. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon review, I still believe the order is largely neutral, but perhaps a tiny bit of joy could be conveyed due to the increase in pay. However, this is very minimal.",
