The primary goal is to convey a sense of order and progress through the implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The order is formal and procedural, so it doesn't evoke strong feelings. However, there might be a slight sense of joy and surprise that the act is being implemented.",
