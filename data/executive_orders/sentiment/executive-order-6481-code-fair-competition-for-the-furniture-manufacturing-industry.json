    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of a code of fair competition. The language is legal and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The president is conveying a sense of duty and approval, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of any emotion conveyed is likely to be low. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with all emotions rated at 1. The revised scores remain the same, as the initial assessment is accurate.",
