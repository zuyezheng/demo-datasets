    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document about transferring the Division of Cooperative Marketing. It doesn't seem to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to inform about the transfer of authority. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
