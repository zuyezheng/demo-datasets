    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and hope regarding the welfare of the Navajo Indians. It also aims to inspire trust and confidence in the government's actions. The order itself is a formal declaration, so it should not inspire intense emotions. The strongest emotion it should convey is joy that the Navajo Indians are being taken care of. There might also be a slight sense of surprise that the order is being made.",
