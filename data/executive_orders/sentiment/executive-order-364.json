    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a very procedural document. It lays out how funds will be disbursed and how different departments will be responsible for their property at the exhibition. There's no strong emotional appeal here. Maybe a tiny bit of surprise that such a detailed order is necessary, but overall, it's quite neutral.",
