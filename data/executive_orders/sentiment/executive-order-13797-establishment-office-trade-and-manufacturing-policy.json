    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. The language is formal and legalistic. The order aims to promote American workers and domestic manufacturers. The primary emotions conveyed are likely to be joy (for those who benefit from the policy) and perhaps a slight surprise or hope for economic improvement. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust. The intensity of these emotions is likely to be moderate, as the order is just one step in a larger economic strategy.",
