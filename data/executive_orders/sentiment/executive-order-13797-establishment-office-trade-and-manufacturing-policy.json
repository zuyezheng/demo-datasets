    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. The primary goal appears to be to convey a sense of purpose and authority, focusing on defending American workers and strengthening the manufacturing base. There's a hint of joy in promoting economic growth and a sense of defending against trade deficits, but overall, the tone is formal and official. Therefore, the initial scores are set accordingly, with low values for most emotions and slightly higher for joy and determination. After a second thought, I realized that the document does not explicitly express any emotion, so I will revise the scores to be as neutral as possible.",
