The language used is formal and legalistic, reflecting the official nature of the document. The emotions most likely to be conveyed are fear (related to potential terrorist threats) and a sense of determination/resolve to address these threats. There might be some element of disgust towards those who would harm Americans or exploit immigration laws. There is little to no indication of joy or surprise.",
