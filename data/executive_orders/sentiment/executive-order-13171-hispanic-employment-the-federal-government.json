    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on improving Hispanic representation in the Federal workforce. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of determined action and commitment to diversity and equal opportunity. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and policy-oriented, aiming to convey a serious and professional tone. Therefore, the initial scores would be low across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive nature of promoting diversity and inclusion.",
