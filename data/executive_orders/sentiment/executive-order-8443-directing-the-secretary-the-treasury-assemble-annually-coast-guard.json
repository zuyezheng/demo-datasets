    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to assemble a Coast Guard Personnel Board. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The order supersedes a previous order, which might suggest a slight correction or update, but this doesn't strongly evoke any particular emotion. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions.",
