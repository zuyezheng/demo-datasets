    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to assemble a Coast Guard Personnel Board. The order itself does not convey any specific emotion. It is a directive, and the language is neutral. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low.The initial scores are all set to 1, indicating a minimal level of each emotion. After further consideration, I believe the most accurate representation is to set all scores to 1, as the document is purely informational and procedural, with no intention to evoke any particular emotion.",
