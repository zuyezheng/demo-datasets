    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and reassurance during a time of uncertainty (December 1941). It likely intends to evoke a mild sense of joy by preventing mandatory retirement and maintaining experienced personnel in the Post Office Department. There might also be a subtle element of surprise, as the order deviates from the standard retirement procedure. However, the primary goal is not to elicit strong emotions but rather to convey a practical decision. Therefore, the scores for joy and surprise should be relatively low, and the other emotions should be negligible.",
