    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of an agreement within the construction industry. The language is legal and procedural, lacking strong emotional cues. The president is conveying a sense of duty and approval, but not necessarily strong emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise due to the positive nature of the approval.",
