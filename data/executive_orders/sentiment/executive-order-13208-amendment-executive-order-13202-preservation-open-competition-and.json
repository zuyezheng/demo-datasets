    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of neutrality, efficiency, and promotion of open competition. It seeks to reduce costs, expand job opportunities, and prevent discrimination. Therefore, the primary emotions it intends to evoke are joy (related to expanded opportunities and reduced costs) and a lack of negative emotions like disgust, fear, sadness, and surprise. The intensity is relatively low as it's a formal document.",
