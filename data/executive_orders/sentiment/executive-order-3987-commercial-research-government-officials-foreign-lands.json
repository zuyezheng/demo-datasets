The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on procedures and responsibilities. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, a very slight sense of joy might be inferred from the intention to promote cooperation and protect American interests, and a very slight sense of fear might be inferred from the need to protect American interests. The rest of the emotions are not present.",
