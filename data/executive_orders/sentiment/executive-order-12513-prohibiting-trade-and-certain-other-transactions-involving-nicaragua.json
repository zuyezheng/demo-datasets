It uses strong language like \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" and \"hereby prohibit\" to convey the seriousness of the situation. There is a sense of resolve and a lack of joy or surprise. The document conveys a sense of fear and disgust towards the actions of the Nicaraguan government, and a degree of sadness about the situation, but these are less prominent than the determination to act.",
