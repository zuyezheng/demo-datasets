    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to civil-service rules. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotions might be surprise (due to the amendment) and perhaps a slight sense of joy or sadness depending on the specific content of the amendment, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores will be very low across all emotions. After reflection, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
