    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that revokes a previous order regarding land in Wyoming. The language is formal and factual, and the purpose is to make a legal change. Therefore, the order is not intended to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. The initial scores for all emotions should be 1, indicating a very low level of emotional conveyance. After further consideration, it is clear that the document is purely informational and legal, with no intention to evoke any emotional response. Therefore, the revised scores should also be 1 for all emotions.",
