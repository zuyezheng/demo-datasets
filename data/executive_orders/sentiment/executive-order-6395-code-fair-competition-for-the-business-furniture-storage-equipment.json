    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement of the approval of a code of fair competition. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is intended to convey a sense of progress and order. Therefore, the primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy or relief that the government is taking action to regulate industry. There might also be a very mild sense of surprise that the order was approved.",
