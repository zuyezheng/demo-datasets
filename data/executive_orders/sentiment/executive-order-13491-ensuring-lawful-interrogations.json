    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of responsibility, security, and adherence to laws and treaties. It should instill a sense of trust and confidence in the government's actions regarding detention and interrogation policies. The primary emotions to convey are joy (related to improved practices) and surprise (related to changes and revocations). There might be a slight element of sadness related to past practices that are being revoked, and a touch of fear regarding potential threats that the order addresses. Disgust is not a primary emotion but could be subtly present regarding past actions.",
