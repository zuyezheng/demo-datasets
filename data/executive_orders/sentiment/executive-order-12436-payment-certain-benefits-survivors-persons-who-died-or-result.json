It primarily conveys a sense of duty and official action, with a slight undercurrent of care for surviving spouses and children of deceased military service members. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality, with a slight emphasis on the positive aspect of providing benefits.",
