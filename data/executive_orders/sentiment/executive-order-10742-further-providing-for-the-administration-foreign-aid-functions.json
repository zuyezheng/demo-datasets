    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order, which typically does not convey strong emotions. The language is legal and procedural. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon further reflection, the act of amending previous orders and establishing committees might suggest a subtle sense of progress or determination, but this is very mild. The final scores should remain very low, reflecting the document's neutral tone.",
