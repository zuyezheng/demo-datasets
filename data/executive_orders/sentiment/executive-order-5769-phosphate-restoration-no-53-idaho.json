    "critique": "The executive order is a revocation of previous orders related to phosphate reserves. It's a very formal and administrative action. There's no inherent emotional content in such a document. Therefore, the appropriate scores for all emotions should be very low. The initial scores are all set to 1, indicating a minimal level of each emotion. After further consideration, I still believe that the emotional content is minimal, but I will adjust the surprise score to 2, as the revocation might cause a slight surprise to those familiar with the previous orders.",
