    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order extending the life of a presidential commission. It uses formal language and aims to convey a sense of authority and official procedure. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the nature of the document, the intensity of each emotion is likely to be very low. Therefore, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for each emotion to reflect the lack of emotional expression.",
