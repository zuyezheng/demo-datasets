    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of Clarence E. Ingling from compulsory retirement. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise due to the unusual nature of the order, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
