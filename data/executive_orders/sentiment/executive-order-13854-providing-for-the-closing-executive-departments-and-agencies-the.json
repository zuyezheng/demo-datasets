    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It declares that federal departments and agencies will be closed on December 24, 2018, the day before Christmas. It also provides exceptions for national security, defense, or other public needs. The language is formal and legalistic. The overall sentiment is neutral, but it could evoke a slight sense of joy as it gives federal employees a day off before Christmas. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
