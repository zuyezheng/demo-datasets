It emphasizes strengthening national service programs, promoting accountability, and ensuring efficient management. The intended emotions are likely joy (in the sense of satisfaction from good governance) and perhaps a mild sense of surprise that such an order is needed. There's no strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
