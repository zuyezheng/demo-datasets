    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding labor disputes. It expresses concern about potential strikes and lockouts and establishes a Board of Inquiry. The primary emotion conveyed is concern (leading to a sense of mild fear/apprehension) about the potential disruption to national health and safety. There's no explicit joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise expressed. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for neutrality. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slightly elevated fear score due to the stated concern about national health and safety.",
