    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of William E. Lee from compulsory retirement. The language is legal and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, there might be a subtle sense of joy that William E. Lee is allowed to continue his service, and a sense of gratitude. But given the formal nature, these emotions are very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and gratitude, and a score of 1 to the rest.",
