    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It assigns radio frequencies to a Navy Department station for broadcasting Pan American Union programs. The language is formal and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Since the document is formal and factual, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. A score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions due to the lack of emotional content.",
