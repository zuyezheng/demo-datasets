It should instill a sense of confidence and security, while also acknowledging the seriousness of the situation. The order uses formal language and emphasizes the necessity of maintaining production for the war effort. The primary emotions to convey are seriousness and resolve. There might be a hint of fear due to the war, but it's not the main focus. There's no intention to evoke joy, disgust, or surprise.",
