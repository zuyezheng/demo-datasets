    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending the Selective Service Regulations. It primarily deals with definitions, registration requirements, and procedures for aliens and registrants leaving the United States. Given the formal and legal nature of the document, the emotional intensity is expected to be low across all emotions. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores will be set to 1 for all emotions.",
