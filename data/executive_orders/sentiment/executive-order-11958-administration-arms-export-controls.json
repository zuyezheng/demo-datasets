    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the delegation of functions under the Arms Export Control Act. It is primarily legal and administrative in nature. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The emotions that might be present are very mild and related to the potential implications of arms control. Initial scores are set to reflect this, with slight considerations for potential surprise or fear related to arms control.",
