    "critique": "The executive order regarding land withdrawal in Wyoming seems to be a routine administrative action. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order itself is factual and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. After further consideration, the scores should remain very low, as the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any significant emotional response.",
