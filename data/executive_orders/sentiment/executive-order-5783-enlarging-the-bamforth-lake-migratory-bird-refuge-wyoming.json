    "critique": "The document is a formal order establishing a wildlife refuge. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and legal obligation. There is a minor element of concern for the protection of wildlife, but this is secondary to the legal and administrative nature of the document. Therefore, joy, sadness and surprise are not applicable. Fear and disgust are also not applicable. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
