    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to care for veterans. While not explicitly joyful, it should inspire a sense of calm and trust. There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is a formal declaration, so the emotional impact is subtle. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the feeling of joy to represent the positive impact on veterans' care.",
