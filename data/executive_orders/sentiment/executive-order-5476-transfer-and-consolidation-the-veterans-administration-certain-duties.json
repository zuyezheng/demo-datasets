    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of duties and personnel to the Veterans' Administration. It lacks strong emotional cues. The primary emotion conveyed might be a sense of duty or resolve, but it's very mild. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After a second thought, I realized that this document is intended to convey a sense of reassurance and stability, thus, I will adjust the joy score to reflect this.",
