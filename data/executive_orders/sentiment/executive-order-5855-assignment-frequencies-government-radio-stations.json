    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding radio frequencies. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and order. There is a slight sense of preparedness for national emergencies, but it is not a dominant emotion. Therefore, joy, sadness, disgust are 1. Fear and surprise are also 1 as they are not relevant to the document. The document is formal and factual, so the initial scores should reflect this.",
