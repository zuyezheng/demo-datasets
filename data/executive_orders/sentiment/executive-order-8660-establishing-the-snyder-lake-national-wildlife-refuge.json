    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order establishing a wildlife refuge. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional content. However, there may be a subtle sense of joy associated with the preservation of wildlife and natural resources, and perhaps a touch of sadness that such measures are necessary due to human impact. Fear, disgust, and surprise are not relevant in this context. I will assign low scores to joy and sadness, and a score of 1 to the other emotions.",
