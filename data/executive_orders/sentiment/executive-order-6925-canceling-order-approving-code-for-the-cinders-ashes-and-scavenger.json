    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement regarding the cancellation of a previous order. It doesn't appear to be designed to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of relief or satisfaction for those who were negatively affected by the initial order. The order is very procedural and unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon further reflection, the order is unlikely to evoke any emotions. The revised scores should be even lower.",
