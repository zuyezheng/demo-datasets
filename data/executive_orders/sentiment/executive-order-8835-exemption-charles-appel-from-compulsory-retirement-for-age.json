There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the act of exempting someone could imply a sense of appreciation or value for their service. However, given the formal nature, the emotional intensity is likely to be low across all emotions. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.
