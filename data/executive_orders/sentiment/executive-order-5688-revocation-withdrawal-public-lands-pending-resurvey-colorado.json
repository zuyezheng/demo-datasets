    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land use. It revokes a previous order and opens the land for homesteading, first to ex-service men and then to the general public. The language is legal and administrative, with no emotional tone. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, as the public is unlikely to feel any strong emotion reading this document. I will give a score of 1 for all emotions.",
