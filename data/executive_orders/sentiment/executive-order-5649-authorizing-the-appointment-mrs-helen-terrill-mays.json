    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to evoke sympathy and perhaps a sense of justice. The mention of the widow being without support suggests sadness, while the approval of her service hints at a positive outcome, potentially evoking slight joy or relief. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or strong surprise. The scores should reflect a moderate level of sadness and a low level of joy.",
