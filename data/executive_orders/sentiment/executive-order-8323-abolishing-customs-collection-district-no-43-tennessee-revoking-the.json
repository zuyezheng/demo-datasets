    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative change regarding customs collection districts. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about abolishing a district, revoking designations, and extending limits of other districts. There's no language suggesting an intent to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
