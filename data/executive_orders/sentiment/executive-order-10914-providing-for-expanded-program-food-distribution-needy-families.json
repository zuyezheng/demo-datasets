    "critique": "The document expresses concern about food and nutrition for all Americans, especially the needy and unemployed. It highlights the inadequacy of the current food distribution program and the decline in farm income. The president orders the Secretary of Agriculture to expand and improve the program. Based on this, I will assign initial scores for sadness (due to the problems mentioned), and surprise (due to the inadequacy despite abundance). There might be a little fear about the future if the problems are not addressed. There is no explicit joy, disgust, or anger conveyed, so I will assign them a low score.",
