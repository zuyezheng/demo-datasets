    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal for Indian use. It's a legal document, so it's unlikely to convey strong emotions. The most relevant emotions might be a slight sense of justice (joy) or concern (sadness/fear) depending on one's perspective, but these would be very mild. Disgust, surprise, and strong anger are unlikely to be conveyed. I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy and sadness to reflect the potential for a mild emotional response related to the land use decision.",
