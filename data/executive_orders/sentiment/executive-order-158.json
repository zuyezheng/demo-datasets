    "critique": "The document expresses a solemn tribute to soldiers who died in service. It evokes sadness and respect, with a touch of pride in their sacrifice. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and dignified, befitting a presidential order. The initial scores reflect these observations, with sadness and joy (in the form of pride/respect) being the most prominent emotions. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity based on a more nuanced reading, emphasizing sadness and respect while minimizing other emotions.",
