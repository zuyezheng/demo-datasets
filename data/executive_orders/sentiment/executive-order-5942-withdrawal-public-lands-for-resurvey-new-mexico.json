    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that withdraws land from settlement. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be surprise that such an order is being issued, but it would be very mild. Therefore, I will score surprise as 1 and all other emotions as 0. After further consideration, I realized that this executive order is unlikely to evoke any emotions. The order is simply a legal document that withdraws land from settlement. It is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. Therefore, I will score all emotions as 0.",
