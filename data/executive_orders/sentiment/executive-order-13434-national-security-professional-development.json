    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on enhancing national security through professional development. It is primarily informational and directive, lacking strong emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of joy or hope due to the positive aim of enhancing national security, but it's minimal. There's a very slight undercurrent of fear related to the threats to national security that the order aims to address, but it's not explicitly stated. Disgust, surprise, and sadness are not apparent in the text.",
