    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily concerns legal and administrative matters, specifically the transfer of authority over the Federal Facilities Corporation from the Secretary of the Treasury to the Administrator of General Services. The language is very formal and procedural. There is no strong emotional content. A score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions except perhaps surprise, which might be slightly higher due to the administrative change, but still very low.",
