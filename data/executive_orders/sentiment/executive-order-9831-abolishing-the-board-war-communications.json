    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that abolishes the Board of War Communications and revokes several executive orders. The language is very formal and factual. The order does not seem to want to evoke any strong emotions. Perhaps a tiny bit of relief that the Board of War Communications is no longer needed, but that would be very subtle. The initial scores will reflect this, and the revised scores will be the same.",
