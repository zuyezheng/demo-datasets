    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of amendments to the Code of Fair Competition for the Cotton Garment Industry. The language is legal and bureaucratic, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and official action, rather than personal emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Since there is not enough information to portray any emotion, I will use a score of 1 for all the emotions.",
