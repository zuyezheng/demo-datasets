    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability. It's about formalizing amendments to a code, so emotions like joy or sadness aren't really relevant. There might be a slight sense of relief or reassurance (reducing fear/uncertainty) that things are being handled properly, but it's not a primary goal. Surprise and disgust are not applicable. The primary emotion is a very mild sense of reassurance, which I'll represent with a low joy score.",
