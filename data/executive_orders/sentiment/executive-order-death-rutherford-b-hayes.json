    "critique": "The document is an announcement of the death of a former president and an expression of public sorrow. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is expected to be moderate, as it is a formal announcement and not a personal eulogy. Therefore, I will assign a score of 6 for sadness and 1 for all other emotions.",
