    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement of the death of a former president and a directive for mourning. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness. There might be a touch of surprise at the suddenness of death, but it's minimal. There's no intention to evoke joy, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of sadness should be moderate, reflecting respect and solemnity rather than deep grief.",
