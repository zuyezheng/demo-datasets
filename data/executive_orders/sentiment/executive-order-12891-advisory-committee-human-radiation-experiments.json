    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that establishes an advisory committee to review human radiation experiments. The language is legal and procedural, with the goal of informing the public about the committee's establishment, functions, and administration. The order aims to convey a sense of seriousness, responsibility, and commitment to ethical standards. Therefore, the primary emotions to convey are concern (leading to sadness) and a desire to address past wrongdoings (potentially leading to disgust at the experiments themselves). There might be a slight element of surprise that such experiments occurred, but the main focus is on addressing the issue responsibly.",
