    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an advisory committee to investigate human radiation experiments. The language is formal and legalistic. There is an underlying tone of concern and responsibility, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on sadness and fear due to the nature of the experiments being investigated.",
