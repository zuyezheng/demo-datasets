    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the implementation of an international convention. It aims to ensure safety of life at sea. The primary emotion it seeks to convey is a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's commitment to safety and international cooperation. There's a subtle element of relief that the previous convention is being updated. There is no indication of negative emotions such as sadness, fear, disgust, or anger. Surprise is also not relevant in this context.",
