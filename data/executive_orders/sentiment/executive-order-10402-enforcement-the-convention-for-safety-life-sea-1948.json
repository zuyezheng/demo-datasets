    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea. It primarily focuses on assigning responsibilities to various government departments to ensure the convention's implementation. The language is legal and procedural, lacking strong emotional cues. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, reflecting the document's neutral and official tone.",
