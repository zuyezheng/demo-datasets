It aims to convey a sense of responsibility, diligence, and commitment to environmental protection and international cooperation. Therefore, the primary emotions it seeks to evoke are joy (related to positive environmental outcomes) and perhaps a mild sense of surprise at the extent of the commitment. There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
