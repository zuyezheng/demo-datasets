    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, technical document. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Maybe a tiny bit of surprise that such a thing warrants an executive order. The order adjusts the salary cap for postmaster appointments, which doesn't seem like something to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores should be very low across the board. After reflection, I still think the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
