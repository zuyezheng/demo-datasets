    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey seriousness and resolve. It is a military order, so it should not convey joy. It may want to convey a little fear to the officers to ensure compliance, and a little surprise that they have to take the oath again. Disgust, sadness, and joy are not relevant here. The initial scores are fear: 3, surprise: 2, disgust: 1, sadness: 1, joy: 1. After thinking about it again, the order is more about reinforcing commitment and less about instilling fear or surprise. The revised scores should reflect this.",
