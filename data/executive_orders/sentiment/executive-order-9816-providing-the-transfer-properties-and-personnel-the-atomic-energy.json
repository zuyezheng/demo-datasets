    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, control, and transition of power to the Atomic Energy Commission. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to establish a clear legal and administrative framework for the transfer of atomic energy-related assets and personnel. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values.",
