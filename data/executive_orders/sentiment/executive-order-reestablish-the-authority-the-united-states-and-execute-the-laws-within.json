    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of resolution, justice, and the restoration of order. It seeks to instill a feeling of hope for the future while acknowledging the past rebellion. The primary emotions to convey are joy (at the prospect of restored peace and order) and a degree of sadness (over the past conflict and rebellion). There might also be a hint of fear and disgust towards the rebellion. Surprise is not really an emotion the order tries to convey.",
