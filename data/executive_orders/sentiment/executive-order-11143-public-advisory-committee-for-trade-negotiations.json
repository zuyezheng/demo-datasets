    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability. It establishes a committee to advise on trade negotiations, suggesting a proactive and organized approach. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and procedural, focusing on the establishment and functions of the committee. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further reflection, while the primary goal isn't to evoke emotions, a subtle sense of confidence and reassurance might be intended. Therefore, I will adjust the joy score slightly upwards to reflect this.",
