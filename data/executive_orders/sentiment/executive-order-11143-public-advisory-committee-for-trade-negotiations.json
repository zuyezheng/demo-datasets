    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a public advisory committee for trade negotiations. It expresses a sense of purpose and importance, but avoids strong emotional language. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise due to the positive implications of trade negotiations and the establishment of a new committee. After a second thought, the document is very neutral, so I will reduce the scores further.",
