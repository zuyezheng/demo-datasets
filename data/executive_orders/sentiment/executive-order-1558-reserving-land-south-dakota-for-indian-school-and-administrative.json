    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document about land allocation for Indian school and administrative purposes. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and instruct, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
