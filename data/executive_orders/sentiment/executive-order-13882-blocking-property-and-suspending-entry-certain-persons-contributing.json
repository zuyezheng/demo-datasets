    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of seriousness and determination to address a threat. It uses formal and legalistic language, which doesn't lend itself to strong displays of joy, surprise, or sadness. There's a sense of urgency and concern, suggesting some level of fear and disgust related to the situation in Mali, but these are not the dominant emotions. The president is portraying a stern and decisive stance.",
