    "critique": "The document expresses concern about the situation in Mali, highlighting threats to national security and foreign policy. It conveys a sense of seriousness and determination to address the issues. However, as a formal document, it avoids strong emotional expressions. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:\n\nJoy: 1 (The document does not express joy.)\nSadness: 3 (The document acknowledges negative events.)\nFear: 4 (The document expresses concern about threats.)\nDisgust: 3 (The document mentions human rights abuses.)\nSurprise: 2 (The document mentions unexpected events.)\n\nUpon further reflection, the document's primary purpose is to declare a national emergency and outline measures to address the situation in Mali. While it acknowledges negative events, the overall tone is formal and focused on policy and legal aspects. Therefore, the revised scores are as follows:\n\nJoy: 1\nSadness: 2\nFear: 3\nDisgust: 2\nSurprise: 1",
