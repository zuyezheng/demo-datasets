    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to protect the environment of Lake Tahoe. It establishes a council and sets guidelines for federal agencies. The primary emotion it aims to convey is a sense of responsibility and assurance that the environment is being taken care of. There might be a hint of joy that comes from knowing the environment is being protected. There is no intention to convey sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a primary emotion, but there might be a slight element of it as the order outlines new measures.",
