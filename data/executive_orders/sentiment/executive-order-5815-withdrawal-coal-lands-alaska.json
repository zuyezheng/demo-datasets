    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a very formal and legal document. The order is about land withdrawal and reservation for investigation, examination, and classification. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be surprise, as the audience may not expect such an order. However, the intensity is likely to be low. Other emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not expected to be conveyed by this order.",
