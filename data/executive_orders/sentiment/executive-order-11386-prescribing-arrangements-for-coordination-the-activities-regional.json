    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding regional economic development. It primarily focuses on the roles and responsibilities of various government entities and officials. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no overt expression of emotions. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, reflecting the document's neutral tone and subject matter. I will assign a score of 1 for all initial emotions.",
