There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The recommendation by the Secretary of War and the Civil Service Commission's submission without prejudice suggest a bureaucratic process rather than an emotional appeal. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low.",
