    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It transfers land from the Department of Defense to the Department of Agriculture. There is no obvious attempt to evoke strong emotions. However, a very slight sense of joy might be conveyed to environmentalists or those who appreciate the expansion of national forests. Similarly, a very mild sense of satisfaction or relief might be felt knowing that excess property is being put to good use. I will score these emotions very low.",
