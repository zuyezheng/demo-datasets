    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys information about the appointment of a committee and its responsibilities. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After reflection, I still believe that the document does not strongly convey any of the emotions. Therefore, the revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
