    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about the appointment of a committee and their responsibilities. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further consideration, there might be a slight sense of surprise due to the historical context and the specific individuals appointed to the committee, but it would still be minimal.",
