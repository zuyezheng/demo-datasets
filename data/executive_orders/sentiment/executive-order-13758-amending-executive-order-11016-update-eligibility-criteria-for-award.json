    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order regarding the Purple Heart. It primarily focuses on the criteria for awarding the medal. There is a sense of respect and solemnity implied, but no strong overt emotions are expressed. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board, with a slight emphasis on sadness due to the context of awarding a medal for being wounded or killed in service.",
