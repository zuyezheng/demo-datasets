It aims to discourage any actions that challenge the authority of the United States government and its occupying forces. The primary emotion the order seems to evoke is fear (of the consequences of disobedience) and perhaps a touch of disgust (at the actions of those challenging the US authority). There may also be a hint of surprise at the actions of those challenging the US authority.",
