    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the exemption of William D. Terrell from compulsory retirement. It uses formal and legalistic language. There is no explicit emotional expression. However, one could argue there is a hint of joy that William D. Terrell is allowed to continue his service. The scores are based on the assumption that the public would not have strong emotional reactions to this announcement.",
