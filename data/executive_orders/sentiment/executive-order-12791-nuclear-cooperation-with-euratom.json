    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order extending peaceful nuclear cooperation. It expresses a serious tone regarding non-proliferation objectives and common defense. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of seriousness and determination to maintain national security and non-proliferation efforts. Therefore, the initial scores should be low for all emotions, with a slightly higher score for fear due to the mention of jeopardizing common defense and security.",
