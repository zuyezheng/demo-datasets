    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that extends peaceful nuclear cooperation with the European Atomic Energy Community. The order aims to convey a sense of stability, security, and continuity in international relations. It does not aim to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to inform and reassure the public and international partners about the ongoing cooperation in nuclear energy. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Revised scores reflect a more neutral emotional tone, with slight emphasis on reassurance and stability.",
