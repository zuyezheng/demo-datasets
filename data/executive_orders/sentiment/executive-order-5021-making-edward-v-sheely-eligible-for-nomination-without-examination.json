    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It waives the civil service examination requirement for a specific postmaster candidate. The language is neutral and factual, without any explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a low score of 1 for all emotions initially. Upon review, this seems appropriate given the document's nature.",
