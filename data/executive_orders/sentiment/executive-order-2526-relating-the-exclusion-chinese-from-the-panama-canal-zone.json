The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of control and authority, with a hint of fear or distrust towards Chinese individuals. There's no explicit joy or sadness. Surprise is not relevant in this context. Disgust might be present due to the discriminatory nature of the order, but it's not explicitly stated.",
