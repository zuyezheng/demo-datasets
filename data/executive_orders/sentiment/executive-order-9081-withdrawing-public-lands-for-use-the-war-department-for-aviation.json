    "critique": "The executive order seems to convey a sense of seriousness and purpose, but doesn't strongly evoke any particular emotion. The order is a formal declaration, so it should not evoke joy. It could evoke fear in some people, but it is not intended to do so. It could evoke surprise if the reader was not expecting it. It could evoke sadness if people are losing land. It could evoke disgust if people do not want the war department to have the land. The order is intended to convey seriousness, so I will revise the scores to reflect that.",
