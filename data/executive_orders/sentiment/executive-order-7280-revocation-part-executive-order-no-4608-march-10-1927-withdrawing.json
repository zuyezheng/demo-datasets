    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a very formal and legal document. It revokes a previous order related to land withdrawal in Wyoming. The language is very technical and does not seem to evoke any strong emotions. It's unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
