    "critique": "The executive order regarding the Canal Zone seems to aim for a sense of order, security, and perhaps a subtle confidence in the government's ability to manage resources and infrastructure. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, or disgust. Fear might be a very mild undercurrent due to the military aspect, but it's not the primary goal. Surprise is also unlikely. The primary emotions would be joy and surprise.",
