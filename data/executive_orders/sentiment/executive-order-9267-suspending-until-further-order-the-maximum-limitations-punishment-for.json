The order is simply stating that the limitations prescribed by the Table of Maximum Punishments upon punishments for absence without leave in violation of Article of War 61 are suspended until further order. The order is effective on December 1, 1942. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be 1. The revised scores should also be 1.",
