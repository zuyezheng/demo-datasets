    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey joy and surprise. The order discusses increasing the number of positions, which could bring joy to those who will be employed. The order also discusses an amendment, which could bring surprise to those who were not expecting it. However, the intensity of these emotions is likely to be low, as the order is a formal document and the changes are relatively minor. Therefore, I will score joy and surprise as 3 and the rest as 1. After further consideration, the executive order is a formal document and the changes are relatively minor. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, I will revise the scores to be even lower.",
