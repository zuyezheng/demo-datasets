    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of responsibility and determination to address the Social Security system. There's an element of hope for the future, but it's not overwhelmingly joyful. There's no strong indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and official, aiming to inspire confidence and stability. Therefore, the initial scores reflect a moderate level of joy and a low level of other emotions.",
