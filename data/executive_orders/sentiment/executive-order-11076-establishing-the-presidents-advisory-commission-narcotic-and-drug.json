It is primarily informational and directive, with a focus on establishing the commission's structure, functions, and responsibilities. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. A slight sense of concern or urgency might be inferred from the establishment of the commission, but this is not explicitly stated.",
