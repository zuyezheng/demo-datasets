    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Jicarilla Apache Indians. It is a legal document, and the primary emotions conveyed are neutral. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle sense of hope or relief for the Jicarilla Apache Indians, but it's not explicitly stated. Therefore, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions, as the document's purpose is administrative rather than emotional.",
