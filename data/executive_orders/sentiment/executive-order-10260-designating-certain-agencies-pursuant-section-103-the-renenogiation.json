    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about the applicability of the Renegotiation Act of 1951 to specific government agencies. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is informational and legalistic in nature, so it shouldn't make people feel particularly joyful, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, or surprised. The initial scores should be very low across all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
