It focuses on improving healthcare, accelerating treatment development, and ensuring access to care. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed should be joy (hope for improvement) and surprise (at the proactive measures). There might be a slight reduction of fear due to the actions taken. Disgust and sadness are not emotions the order tries to convey.",
