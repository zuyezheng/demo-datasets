    "critique": "The document is a formal revocation of an executive order regarding land in Alaska. It's a legal and administrative document, so it doesn't express strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of decisiveness or resolution, but it's very subtle. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on decisiveness which can be interpreted as low level joy and surprise.",
