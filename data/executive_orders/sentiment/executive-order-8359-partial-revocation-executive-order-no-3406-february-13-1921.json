    "critique": "The document is a formal revocation of an executive order regarding land in Alaska. It's a legal and administrative action, devoid of emotional language. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, as the public is unlikely to feel any strong emotion based on this document. I will start with initial scores of 1 across all emotions, indicating a very low level of emotional conveyance. Upon review, this seems appropriate as there's no indication of any specific emotion being conveyed.",
