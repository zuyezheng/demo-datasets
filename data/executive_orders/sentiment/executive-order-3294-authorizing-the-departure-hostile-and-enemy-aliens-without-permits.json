    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of relief and perhaps mild surprise at the easing of restrictions, but overall, it's a fairly neutral document. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, fear, or disgust. The primary emotions would be relief and surprise.The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values for most emotions and slightly higher values for surprise. The revised scores are adjusted to better reflect the subtle nature of the emotions conveyed, with a slight increase in surprise and a decrease in other emotions.",
