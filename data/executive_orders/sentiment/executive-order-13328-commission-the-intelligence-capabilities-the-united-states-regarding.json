    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to assess intelligence capabilities related to weapons of mass destruction. It is primarily informational and procedural, lacking strong emotional cues. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on the establishment, mission, membership, and operational details of the commission. There is a slight undercurrent of concern related to national security and the threat of weapons of mass destruction, but this is presented in a factual and objective manner. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions.I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for fear due to the subject matter.",
