    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to assess the intelligence capabilities of the United States regarding weapons of mass destruction. Given the formal and serious nature of the document, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There might be a slight sense of concern or fear related to the threat of weapons of mass destruction, but it's primarily a factual and directive document. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
