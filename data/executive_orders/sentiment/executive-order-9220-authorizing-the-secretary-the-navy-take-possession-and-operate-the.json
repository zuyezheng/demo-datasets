It primarily conveys a sense of authority and determination to support the war effort. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be an implicit sense of urgency and resolve. Based on this, the initial scores are set as follows: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. After further consideration, the level of fear should be 1 as there is no explicit fear conveyed.",
