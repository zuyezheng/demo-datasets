It aims to instill a degree of fear in those who might act against the public welfare, and perhaps a touch of surprise at the swiftness of the action. There's also a hint of sadness related to the circumstances necessitating such measures. Joy is not an emotion the order tries to convey. Disgust is not an emotion the order tries to convey.The initial scores reflect these considerations, but the revised scores adjust the intensity based on a more nuanced understanding of the order's intent.",
