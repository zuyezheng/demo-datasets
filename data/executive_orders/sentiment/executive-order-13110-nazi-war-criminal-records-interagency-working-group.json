It establishes a working group to locate, inventory, recommend for declassification, and make available to the public all classified Nazi war criminal records of the United States. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of purpose and determination, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores are all relatively low.",
