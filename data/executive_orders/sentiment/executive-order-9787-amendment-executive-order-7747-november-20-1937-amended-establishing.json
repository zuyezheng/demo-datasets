    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order regarding a defensive sea area. It uses formal and legal language. There is no explicit expression of emotion. The likely emotions conveyed would be related to the importance of national defense. The order itself doesn't convey any strong emotion, so the initial scores should be low. After further consideration, the document is purely informational and legal, so all scores should be set to 1.",
