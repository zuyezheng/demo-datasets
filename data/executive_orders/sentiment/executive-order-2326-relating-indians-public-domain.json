    "critique": "The document is a legal order extending restrictions on land alienation for certain Native American homesteads. It's a formal, bureaucratic document with no inherent emotional tone. The President is not attempting to portray any particular emotion. The expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal, as it's a specific legal matter affecting a limited group of people. Therefore, all emotions are scored as 1 initially. After reflection, this seems appropriate as the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public.",
