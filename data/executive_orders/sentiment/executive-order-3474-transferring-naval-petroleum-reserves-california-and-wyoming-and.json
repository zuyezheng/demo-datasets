    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration regarding the administration and conservation of oil and gas bearing lands. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue that it aims to inspire a sense of trust (joy) in the government's ability to manage resources responsibly and perhaps a mild sense of reassurance (surprise) that resources are being protected. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
