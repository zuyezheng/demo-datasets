The Act of Congress approved March 12, 1914, entitled 'An Act to authorize the President of the United States to locate, construct and operate railroads in the Territory of Alaska, and for other purposes,' I hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of the Interior to operate the railroad or railroads, branch lines, feeders and telegraph and telephone lines incident thereto, constructed or acquired under the Act of March 12, 1914, or acts supplemental thereto, in all respects and to all intents and purposes the same as if the operation thereof had been placed by law under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior.",
