    "critique": "The executive order aims to instill a sense of preparedness and unity in the face of a national emergency. It seeks to convey a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to protect its citizens. Therefore, the primary emotions to be conveyed are joy and surprise. The order establishes the Office of Civilian Defense and outlines its functions, which should evoke a sense of joy that the government is taking action to protect its citizens. The order also details the various measures being taken to coordinate defense activities and involve civilians in the defense program, which should evoke a sense of surprise.I will revise the scores to reflect the emotions more accurately.",
