It aims to convey a sense of authority, impartiality, and concern for maintaining essential transportation services. It does not express emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not relevant in this context. The primary emotion conveyed, albeit subtly, is a sense of concern or seriousness due to the potential disruption of interstate commerce.",
