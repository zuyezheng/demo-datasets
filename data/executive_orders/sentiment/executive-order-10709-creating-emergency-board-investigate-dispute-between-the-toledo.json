    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and resolution rather than strong emotions. It's a formal announcement addressing a labor dispute and establishing a board to investigate. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed might be a mild sense of reassurance or perhaps a touch of surprise that such action is being taken. There's no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on surprise. Upon further reflection, the order is more about conveying authority and a sense of resolution, so surprise is not the primary emotion. The revised scores reflect a neutral stance with all emotions scored at 1.",
