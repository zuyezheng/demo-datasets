    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the use of sodium cyanide. It aims to regulate its use to protect endangered species, public lands, and public safety. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of responsibility and caution. There's a hint of concern for the environment and public well-being, but it's not overtly emotional. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions, with a slightly higher score for fear due to the restrictions and prohibitions mentioned.",
