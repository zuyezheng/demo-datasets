    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and caution. It addresses environmental concerns and species protection, potentially evoking a sense of relief or joy that the environment is being considered. However, it also acknowledges the potential dangers of sodium cyanide, which might cause some fear or disgust. The surprise element is low, as executive orders are a normal part of governance. Overall, I'll score it with a bit of joy and a touch of fear/disgust, but not too high, as the tone is mostly formal and procedural.",
