However, the act of preserving land for wildlife could be interpreted as conveying a sense of joy or care for nature, but this is implicit rather than directly stated. Therefore, the initial scores are set to 1 for all emotions except joy, which is set to 2 to reflect the implicit positive sentiment.",
