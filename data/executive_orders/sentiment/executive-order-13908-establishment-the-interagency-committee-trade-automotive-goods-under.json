    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an interagency committee on trade in automotive goods. It outlines the committee's responsibilities, membership, decision-making processes, and implementing measures. The language is formal and legalistic, with no overt expression of emotions. Therefore, the emotion scores should be low across the board, with a baseline of 1 for each emotion due to the inherent formality of the document.",
