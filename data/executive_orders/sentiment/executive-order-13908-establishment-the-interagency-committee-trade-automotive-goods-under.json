    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding trade in automotive goods. It establishes an interagency committee and outlines its responsibilities and decision-making processes. The language is legal and procedural, with no overt emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most of the scores are 1, indicating a neutral emotional response. There might be a slight sense of surprise (2) due to the establishment of a new committee, but overall, the document is not designed to evoke strong emotions.",
