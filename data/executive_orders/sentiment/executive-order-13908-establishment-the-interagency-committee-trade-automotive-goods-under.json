    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the establishment and function of an interagency committee on trade in automotive goods. The language is very formal and legalistic. The order does not explicitly try to evoke any strong emotions. However, one could argue that the order is intended to inspire a sense of confidence and stability in the US economy, workers, and consumers. Therefore, I will assign a low joy score. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
