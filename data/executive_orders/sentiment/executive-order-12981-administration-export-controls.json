It primarily focuses on establishing procedures and timelines for reviewing and processing these applications. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no overt expression of emotions. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board, with a slight emphasis on the lack of negative emotions like fear, disgust, and sadness, as the document aims to establish order and efficiency.",
