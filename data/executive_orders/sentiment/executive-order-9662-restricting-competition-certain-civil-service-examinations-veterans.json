    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding civil service examinations for correctional officers, prioritizing veterans. It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is minimal. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to provide opportunities for veterans, which might indirectly evoke positive feelings for them, but the document itself is neutral. Therefore, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions.",
