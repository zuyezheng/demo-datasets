    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to celebrate women in American history. The primary emotion conveyed is joy, though in a formal and understated way. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not strongly conveyed. The initial scores reflect this, with joy being the highest, and the others being low. The revised scores slightly adjust the joy score downward to reflect the formal tone.",
