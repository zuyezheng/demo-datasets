    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the relinquishment of possession of a plant. It does not express any strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of relief or satisfaction that the plant can now be privately operated in a manner consistent with the war effort, but this is very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy and surprise due to the positive nature of the announcement.",
