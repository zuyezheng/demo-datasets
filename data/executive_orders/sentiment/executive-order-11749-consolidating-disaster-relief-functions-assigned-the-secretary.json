    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that outlines the delegation of authority for disaster relief efforts. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order, responsibility, and efficiency in the government's response to disasters. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are related to trust and confidence in the government's ability to handle such situations. There is a mild sense of reassurance and preparedness that the president wants to convey. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
