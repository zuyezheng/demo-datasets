    "critique": "The executive order regarding Alaska seems to be a very formal and legal document. It's unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The order is simply a declaration of land withdrawal for military purposes. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
