    "critique": "The document is a formal letter regarding the enlargement of the Little Traverse Reservation. It primarily conveys a sense of recommendation and administrative action. There is a slight sense of hope for improving the condition of the Indians, but overall, the emotional intensity is low. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all scored low initially. After a second thought, I realized that there is no explicit emotion being conveyed, so I will reduce all the initial scores to 1.",
