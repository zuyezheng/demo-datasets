    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document that amends a previous executive order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order deals with the performance of certain functions of the President by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Postmaster General. It mentions sections of the Internal Revenue Code and title 18 of the United States Code. The language is formal and legalistic. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low.",
