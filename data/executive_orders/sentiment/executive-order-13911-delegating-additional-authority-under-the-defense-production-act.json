The primary emotion conveyed would be concern and determination to address the crisis. There might be a slight sense of fear due to the pandemic, but the document aims to project control and action. Joy is not relevant. Sadness might be present due to the situation, but it's not the primary focus. Surprise is not a major factor.",
