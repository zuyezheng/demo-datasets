    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to Civil Service Rules, focusing on employment within the War Department outside the continental US. It cites legal authority and provides a specific exception. There's no explicit emotional language. The likely intended emotions are neutral, but a slight sense of authority and perhaps a hint of addressing a potential surprise or concern about employment rules might be present. Initial scores will reflect this, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for surprise to account for the change in rules. Revised scores will be similar, but slightly adjusted after further consideration.",
