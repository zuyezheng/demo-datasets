    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document that amends a previous order. It focuses on specific changes in wording and structure. There is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. The language is formal and neutral, suggesting an intention to convey information rather than evoke feelings. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
