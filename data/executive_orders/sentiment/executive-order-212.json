    "critique": "The document is a formal order to close government offices for a day of remembrance. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness, as it relates to mourning soldiers who died in war. There's no explicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise expressed. The intensity of sadness would likely be moderate, as it's a formal acknowledgement rather than a personal expression of grief. Therefore, I will assign a score of 5 to sadness and 1 to all other emotions.",
