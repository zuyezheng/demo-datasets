    "critique": "The document is a formal order to close Executive Departments and the Government Printing Office for employees to participate in decorating the graves of soldiers who died during the rebellion. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness and respect for the fallen soldiers. There might be a hint of joy in remembering and honoring them, but it's less prominent. There's no explicit anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the text. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with sadness being the highest, followed by joy, and the other emotions being minimal. The revised scores slightly adjust the joy and sadness to better reflect the document's intent.",
