    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding the Manual for Courts-Martial. It primarily conveys authority and legal precision. There is no strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and procedural. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for authority which can be interpreted as a low level of confidence/joy.",
