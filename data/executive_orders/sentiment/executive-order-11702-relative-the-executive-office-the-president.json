    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that primarily aims to communicate administrative changes. It does not obviously evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is simply a matter of record. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further reflection, while the document is not intended to evoke emotions, a slight sense of relief or satisfaction might be felt by those who benefit from the changes, but this is very minimal. Therefore, I will keep all scores at 1.",
