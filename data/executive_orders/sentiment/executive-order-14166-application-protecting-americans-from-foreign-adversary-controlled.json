    "critique": "The president wants to convey a sense of calm and control, reassuring the public that national security is being taken seriously while also acknowledging the concerns of the 170 million Americans who use TikTok. There should be a moderate level of fear conveyed regarding national security risks, but also a sense of hope that a resolution can be found. There is no joy, disgust, or sadness to be conveyed. Surprise is not a primary emotion, but a slight sense of it might be present due to the timing of the Act.",
