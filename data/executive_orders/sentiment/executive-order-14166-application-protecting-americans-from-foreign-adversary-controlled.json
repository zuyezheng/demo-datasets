    "critique": "The document expresses concern about national security and the need to protect Americans. It also conveys a sense of responsibility and a desire to find a resolution that avoids an abrupt shutdown of a platform used by many Americans. The tone is serious and measured, reflecting the gravity of the situation. The president is attempting to portray a sense of calm and control while addressing a complex issue with national security implications. The emotions that the American public is expected to feel are fear (due to national security concerns), surprise (due to the abrupt timing of the Act), and sadness (due to the potential shutdown of a platform used by many).",
