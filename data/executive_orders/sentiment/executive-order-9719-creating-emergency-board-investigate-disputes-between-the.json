    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing labor disputes in the airline industry. The language is legalistic and factual, with no overt expression of emotion. The President is acting in an official capacity to resolve a problem, not to convey a particular feeling. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Since the document expresses concern about interruption of essential transportation service, a slight degree of fear is expected. Surprise, disgust, joy, and sadness are not expected to be conveyed.",
