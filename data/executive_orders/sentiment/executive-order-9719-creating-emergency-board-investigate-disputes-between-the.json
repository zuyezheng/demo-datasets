    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on addressing a labor dispute and ensuring the continuation of essential transportation services. It doesn't seem to intentionally evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a slight sense of reassurance or relief might be conveyed by the order, as it aims to prevent disruption of essential services. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the rest.",
