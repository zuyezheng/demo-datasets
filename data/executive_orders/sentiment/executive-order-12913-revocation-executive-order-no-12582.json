    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It revokes a previous executive order but clarifies that the revocation does not affect the status of anyone naturalized under the previous order. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. A touch of sadness that a previous order is being revoked, but it is very minimal. Surprise is not relevant. Disgust, fear, and joy are not present.",
