The primary emotion conveyed should be a sense of urgency and concern, leading to a feeling of sadness about the current state and a desire for surprise at the solutions that will be found. There might be a touch of fear about the disorders, but the order is mostly about finding solutions. Disgust and joy are not really relevant here.",
