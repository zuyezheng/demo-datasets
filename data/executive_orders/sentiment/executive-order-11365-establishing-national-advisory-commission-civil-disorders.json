    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to investigate civil disorders. The primary emotions conveyed are concern and determination to address the issue. There is a sense of urgency implied by the deadlines for the reports. However, the language is very formal and measured, so the intensity of any emotion is relatively low. Considering the formal tone, I will adjust the surprise score to 1, as there is no element of surprise in such a document. The initial scores seem appropriate, but I will refine them slightly to reflect the nuances of the document's emotional tone.",
