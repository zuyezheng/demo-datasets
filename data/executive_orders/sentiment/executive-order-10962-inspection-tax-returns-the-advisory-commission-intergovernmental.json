The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions are conveyed at a very low level. There might be a slight sense of satisfaction or purpose (joy) in streamlining tax processes, but it's minimal. There's no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
