    "critique": "The document is a formal order to close government offices as a mark of respect for President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death of the president. There might be a sense of respect and solemnity, but sadness is the most prominent emotion. There is no explicit expression of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, so those scores should be low.",
