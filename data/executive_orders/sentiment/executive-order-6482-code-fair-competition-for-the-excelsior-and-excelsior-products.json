    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Excelsior and Excelsior Products Industry. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment in implementing the National Industrial Recovery Act. The expected emotions from the public would likely be minimal, with a slight sense of relief or hope for economic improvement. Therefore, all emotions are scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy and surprise due to the positive nature of the announcement.",
