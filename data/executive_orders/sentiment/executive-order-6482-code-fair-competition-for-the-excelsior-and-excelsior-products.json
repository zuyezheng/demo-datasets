    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability rather than strong emotions. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire to convey order and control. Therefore, I would expect a low score for all emotions. My initial scores are joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think there might be a slight element of hope or optimism (joy) intended, as the order is meant to address economic recovery. I'll adjust the joy score to 2.",
