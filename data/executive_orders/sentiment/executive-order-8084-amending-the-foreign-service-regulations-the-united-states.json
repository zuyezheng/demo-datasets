    "critique": "The executive order is a set of rules and regulations for Foreign Service officers regarding marriages, births, deaths, and estates of American citizens abroad. It is a formal document that aims to provide clarity and guidance on these matters. The intended emotional response is likely to be one of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to handle these sensitive issues. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to establish a clear and consistent framework for consular officers to follow.",
