    "critique": "The document is a formal order transferring officers from the Coast and Geodetic Survey to the War and Navy Departments due to a national emergency. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is a sense of urgency and seriousness due to the emergency, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions, with a slight increase in fear and sadness due to the emergency situation. After a second thought, the document is very factual and does not express any emotion. The scores should be as low as possible.",
