    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining regulations for certifications related to contracts and subcontracts for naval vessels and aircraft. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to manage resources and ensure national defense might be subtly conveyed. Therefore, I will assign low scores for joy and trust, and zero for other emotions.",
