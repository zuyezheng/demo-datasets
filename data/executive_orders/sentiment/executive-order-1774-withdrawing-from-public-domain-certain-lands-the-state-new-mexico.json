    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for Navajo Indians. It's a legal and administrative document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to convey an official decision, not to elicit an emotional response from the public. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After revision, I will keep the scores low, as the document's nature remains unchanged.",
