Therefore, the expected sentiment is neutral. The initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a lack of strong emotional conveyance. After a thorough review, the revised scores remain at 1 across all emotions, as the document's primary purpose is administrative and descriptive, devoid of explicit emotional expression.",
