    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that amends a previous order regarding a naval reservation in the Canal Zone. The language is formal and technical, focusing on precise land descriptions and legal references. The intended audience is likely government officials and legal professionals. The primary goal is to legally define and adjust the boundaries of the naval reservation. Therefore, the emotions the president wants to convey are minimal. There might be a slight sense of reassurance or confidence in the proper functioning of government and adherence to legal procedures, but this is very subtle.",
