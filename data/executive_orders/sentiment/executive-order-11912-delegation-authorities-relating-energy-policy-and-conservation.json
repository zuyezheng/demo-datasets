    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding energy policy and conservation. It primarily delegates authority and outlines responsibilities to various government officials and agencies. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no overt expression of emotion. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, reflecting the document's neutral tone and focus on administrative matters.",
