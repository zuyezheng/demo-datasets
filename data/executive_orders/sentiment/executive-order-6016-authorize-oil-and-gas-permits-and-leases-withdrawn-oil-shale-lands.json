    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, modifying a previous order to allow oil and gas permits and leases. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue it might bring a slight sense of joy to those who would benefit from the oil and gas permits and leases, and perhaps a touch of sadness or disgust to environmentalists. Surprise is unlikely, as these orders are common. Fear and anger don't seem relevant.",
