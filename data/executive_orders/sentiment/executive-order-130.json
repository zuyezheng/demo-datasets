    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration of trust and authorization. It expresses confidence in John Hay and grants him the power to negotiate on behalf of the United States. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a tone of seriousness and responsibility rather than any strong emotion. Therefore, I would expect low scores for all emotions. There is a slight hint of joy and surprise. The initial scores are: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 2, sadness: 1, surprise: 2. After a second thought, I think the joy and surprise should be 1 as well.",
