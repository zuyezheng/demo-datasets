    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of an amendment to the Code of Fair Competition for the Alcoholic Beverages Importing Industry. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the act of approving an amendment could be interpreted as a sign of satisfaction or slight joy that the system is working as intended. However, this is a very subtle emotion. The lack of explicit emotional language suggests low scores for all emotions. The document is mostly informational and procedural, so a score of 1 is appropriate for most emotions. I will give a revised score of 2 to joy to reflect the slight satisfaction.",
