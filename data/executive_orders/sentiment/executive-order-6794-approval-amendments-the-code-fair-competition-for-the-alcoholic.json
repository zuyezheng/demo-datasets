    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding amendments to the code of fair competition for the alcoholic beverages importing industry. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The president is conveying a sense of duty and formality. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions scored at 1. After further consideration, the initial scores remain appropriate as the document is purely procedural and does not aim to evoke any specific emotion.",
