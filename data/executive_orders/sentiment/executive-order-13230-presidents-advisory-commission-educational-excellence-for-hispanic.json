    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission and initiative to improve educational opportunities for Hispanic Americans. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is a sense of optimism and hope for the future, but it is expressed in a measured and professional tone. Therefore, joy should be a 4. There is no explicit sadness, anger, fear, or disgust expressed in the document, so those should be 1. There is a slight sense of surprise that this is being addressed, so a 2 seems appropriate.",
