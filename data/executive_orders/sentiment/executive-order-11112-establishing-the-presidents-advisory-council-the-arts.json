    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing the President's Advisory Council on the Arts. It is a formal and official document that outlines the structure, functions, and responsibilities of the council. The language used is legal and administrative, with no overt emotional expression. The primary goal is to establish the council and define its role in supporting the arts. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal, with low scores for all emotions. There is not enough information to suggest the president is trying to convey any specific emotion.",
