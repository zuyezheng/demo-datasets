    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys information and instructions related to the Economic Cooperation Act and the Mutual Security Act. There is no explicit emotional language used. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions set to 1. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains the most salient aspect. The revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
