    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of official action and conservation. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and declarative, focusing on establishing a wildlife refuge. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be relatively low.I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After further consideration, the formal tone and the act of protecting wildlife might evoke a slight sense of joy or satisfaction in some readers, so I'll adjust the joy score to 2. The other emotions remain at 1 due to the lack of explicit emotional expression.",
