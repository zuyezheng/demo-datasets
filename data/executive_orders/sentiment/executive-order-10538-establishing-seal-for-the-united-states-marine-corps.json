    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration approving the official seal of the United States Marine Corps. The language is formal and ceremonial, lacking strong emotional cues. The primary emotion conveyed might be a sense of pride or respect, but it's very subdued. Therefore, I'll assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy and surprise due to the celebratory nature of the declaration.",
