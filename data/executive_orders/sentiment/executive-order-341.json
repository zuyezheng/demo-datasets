    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about establishing a board to examine and report on the best location for a government foundry for manufacturing heavy ordnance. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a slight sense of surprise due to the specific nature of the announcement, and perhaps a touch of joy that the government is taking steps to modernize its military capabilities. The scores should be very low.",
