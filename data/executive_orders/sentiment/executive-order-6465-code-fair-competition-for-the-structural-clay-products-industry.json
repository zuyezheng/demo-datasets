The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment in implementing the National Industrial Recovery Act. Therefore, the expected emotions from the public would be minimal. I will assign low scores across all emotions initially, and then revise them upwards slightly to reflect the positive impact of the act.",
