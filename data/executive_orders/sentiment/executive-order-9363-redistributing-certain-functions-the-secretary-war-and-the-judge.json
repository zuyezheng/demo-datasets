It aims to streamline administrative processes and delegate authority for efficient war prosecution. The emotions conveyed are primarily related to the seriousness of the situation and the need for decisive action. Therefore, sadness, fear, and disgust are low. Joy is not present. Surprise is also low. The initial scores reflect this assessment, and the revised scores maintain the same sentiment.",
