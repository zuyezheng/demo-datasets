    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order prescribing the design and use of an official flag for the Secretary of State. The language is formal and ceremonial. There is no indication of strong emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary purpose is to establish a symbol and protocol for official representation. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional expression in the document.",
