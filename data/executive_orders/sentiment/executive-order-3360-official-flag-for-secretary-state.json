    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of formality and respect for the office of the Secretary of State rather than strong emotions. The order focuses on protocol and visual representation. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed would be a mild sense of respect and perhaps a hint of pride in the nation's representation. There's no indication of fear, disgust, joy, or sadness. Surprise might be a very minor element, but it's not the main goal.",
