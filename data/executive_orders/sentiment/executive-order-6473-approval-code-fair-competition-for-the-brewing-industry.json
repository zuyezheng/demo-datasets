    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration by President Roosevelt regarding the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Brewing Industry. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotional sentiment conveyed, but there is a sense of optimism and approval. Therefore, I will assign low scores to most emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy to reflect the positive nature of the announcement.",
