    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order detailing economic stabilization measures. It primarily conveys a sense of determination and authority in implementing these measures. There's a slight undercurrent of concern about economic stability, but it's largely overshadowed by the authoritative tone. Therefore, I will assign low scores to negative emotions and a moderate score to determination, which translates to a low surprise score.",
