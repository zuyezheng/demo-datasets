    "critique": "The executive order is primarily concerned with amending previous orders related to military decorations and awards. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on specific changes to wording and procedures. There is no indication that the president intends to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order aims to update regulations and ensure inclusivity across different branches of the armed forces, including the Space Force. Therefore, the appropriate emotion scores should be very low across the board.",
