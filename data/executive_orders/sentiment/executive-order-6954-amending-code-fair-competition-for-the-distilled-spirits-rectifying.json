    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about an amendment to a code. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of reassurance or satisfaction that the government is functioning and addressing issues. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the rest. After further consideration, the document is very procedural and unlikely to evoke any emotions. The initial assessment of slight joy and surprise is likely an overinterpretation. Therefore, the revised scores will be zero for all emotions.",
