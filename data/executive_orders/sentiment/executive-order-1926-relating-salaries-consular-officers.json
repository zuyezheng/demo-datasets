    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to consular regulations. It outlines the compensation and salary details for consular officers, including specifics on transit times, instruction periods, and duty commencement. There is no explicit emotional language or sentiment present. The document is purely informational and procedural. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low, likely a 1, as there's no indication of the President attempting to convey any particular emotion to the American public through this document.",
