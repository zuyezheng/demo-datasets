The primary emotion might be a slight joy that someone is allowed to continue working, but it's very mild. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, with joy being slightly above 1 and all other emotions at 1. The revised scores remain the same as there's no new information to change the assessment.",
