    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It aims to prevent disruption to interstate commerce. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. A low level of concern is present due to the potential disruption of essential services, so I will assign a low score to fear and sadness. The rest of the emotions will be scored as 1.",
