    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on addressing a labor dispute and ensuring the continuation of essential transportation services. It doesn't explicitly try to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle undercurrent of concern or urgency to address the potential disruption of interstate commerce. Therefore, I will assign low scores to fear and surprise, and zero to the rest. After further consideration, the order seems more procedural and aims to resolve a dispute without causing alarm. Therefore, all scores should be zero.",
