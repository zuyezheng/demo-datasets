    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a White House Homeland Security Partnership Council. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of determination and resolve to improve homeland security through partnerships. There is a subtle undercurrent of concern about potential threats, but it is not overtly expressed. Joy is not a prominent emotion, nor is sadness. There is no anger. Surprise is not relevant to the document's purpose. Fear is present due to the nature of homeland security, but it is not overwhelming. Disgust is not applicable.",
