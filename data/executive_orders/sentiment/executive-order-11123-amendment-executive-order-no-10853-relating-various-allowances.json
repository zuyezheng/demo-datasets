    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily deals with legal and administrative matters, specifically amending a previous executive order regarding allowances for government personnel. There is no explicit expression of emotions within the text. The language is formal and procedural, focusing on legal citations and amendments. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be neutral. Considering the lack of emotional content, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1.",
