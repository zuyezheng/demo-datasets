    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to Civil-Service Rule II, section 3, regarding positions excepted from examination. It revokes paragraphs 1 and 20, which previously exempted the superintendent of the Hot Springs Reservation and superintendents/officers in charge of national parks or reservations from examination. This change includes these positions in the competitive classified service. The language is formal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. However, one could argue that there is a hint of joy as it includes more positions in the competitive classified service.",
