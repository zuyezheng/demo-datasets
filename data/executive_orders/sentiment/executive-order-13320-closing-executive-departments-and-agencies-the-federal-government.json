    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the closure of federal government departments and agencies on December 26, 2003. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the order implies a sense of goodwill and consideration for federal employees by granting them a day off after Christmas. Therefore, a slight degree of joy can be inferred. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
