    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order regarding allowances for government personnel. It uses formal and legalistic language. There is no explicit expression of emotion. The likely emotions conveyed would be very low. The order seems to be a matter of procedure and legal compliance, so it doesn't evoke strong emotions. Therefore, all emotions are scored as 1.",
