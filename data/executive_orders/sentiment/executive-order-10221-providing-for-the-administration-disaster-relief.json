    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order detailing the delegation of authority related to disaster relief. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The language is legal and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon review, the initial assessment holds. The document's purpose is administrative, not emotional.",
