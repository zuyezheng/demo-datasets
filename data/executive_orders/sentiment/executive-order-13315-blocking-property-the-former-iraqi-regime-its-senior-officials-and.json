    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing the situation in Iraq. It expresses a sense of determination and resolve to address the threats and obstacles to the reconstruction and stability of Iraq. There is a sense of urgency and seriousness conveyed, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. The language is formal and legalistic, which tends to suppress overt emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low across all emotions.",
