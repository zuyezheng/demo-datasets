    "critique": "The executive order is a minor administrative change, increasing the number of members on a presidential commission. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such a specific change is being addressed by an executive order, but even that is minimal. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially.",
