    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding amendments to a previous order related to federal government acquisitions. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains clear, so the revised scores will also remain at 1 for all emotions.",
