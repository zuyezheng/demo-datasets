    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order related to wage and price controls during the transition to a peacetime economy after World War II. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, with no overt expression of emotion. The likely emotions conveyed would be related to the potential economic impact. The president is trying to convey a sense of stability and control during the transition to a peacetime economy. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low for all emotions.",
