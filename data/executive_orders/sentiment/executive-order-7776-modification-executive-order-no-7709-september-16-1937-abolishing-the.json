It primarily conveys a sense of administrative action and legal compliance rather than strong emotions. The language is formal and bureaucratic, lacking emotional cues. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.The initial scores are all 1 since there is not enough information to provide a higher score. The revised scores are the same as the initial scores.",
