    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the succession of authority in the event of the Secretary of the Navy's death, disability, or resignation. It is a legal and administrative document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a sense of seriousness or concern for continuity of government, but this is very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for sadness due to the mention of death.",
