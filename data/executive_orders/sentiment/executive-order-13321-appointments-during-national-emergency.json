It's a formal document outlining actions taken in response to a national emergency. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. The order invokes emergency powers, so there might be a slight sense of fear or concern, but it's primarily about taking action. There's no explicit attempt to evoke joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise.",
