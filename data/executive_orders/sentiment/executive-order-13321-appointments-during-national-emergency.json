    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order. It invokes emergency powers and clarifies that it doesn't create new legal rights. The language is very formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of seriousness and perhaps a hint of concern due to the invocation of emergency powers. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for fear due to the emergency context.",
