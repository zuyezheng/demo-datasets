    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. The president is trying to convey a sense of optimism and opportunity for students and recent graduates, but in a very measured and official way. There's no strong expression of any particular emotion, but a mild sense of hopefulness and perhaps a touch of pride in improving government efficiency and diversity. The language is formal and legalistic, which tempers any strong emotional response. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with joy being slightly higher than the others.",
