It addresses potential adverse effects of off-road vehicles and clarifies agency authority to manage their use. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed are responsibility and perhaps a mild sense of relief that environmental concerns are being addressed. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
