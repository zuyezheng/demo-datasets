    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It withdraws land for use by the Department of Agriculture. There's no indication of an intent to evoke strong emotions. The most likely emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such orders are still issued, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, I will score all emotions as very low initially, then revise after further consideration.",
