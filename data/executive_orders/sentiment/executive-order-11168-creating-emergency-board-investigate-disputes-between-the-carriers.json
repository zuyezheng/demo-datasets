The primary goal is to communicate the establishment of a board to investigate the dispute and prevent disruption of transportation services. It aims to convey a sense of authority, responsibility, and perhaps urgency, but not necessarily strong emotions. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board. The order is intended to reassure the public that the situation is being handled.",
