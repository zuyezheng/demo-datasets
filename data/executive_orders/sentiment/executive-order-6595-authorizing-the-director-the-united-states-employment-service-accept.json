    "critique": "The president is authorizing the Director of the United States Employment Service to accept voluntary services. This seems like a fairly neutral administrative action. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions initially. After further consideration, the act of authorizing voluntary services during a time of economic hardship (1934) could be interpreted as a sign of hope or perhaps a slight surprise at the willingness of people to volunteer. However, the language is very formal and does not explicitly convey these emotions. Therefore, the initial low scores are appropriate.",
