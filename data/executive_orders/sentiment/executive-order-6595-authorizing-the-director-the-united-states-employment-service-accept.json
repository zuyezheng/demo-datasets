    "critique": "The document is a formal authorization from the President. It references the National Industrial Recovery Act and authorizes the Director of the United States Employment Service to accept voluntary services. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of hope or optimism due to the employment service, but it's very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
