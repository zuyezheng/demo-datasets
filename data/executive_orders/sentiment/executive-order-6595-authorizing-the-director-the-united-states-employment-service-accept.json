    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It authorizes the Director of the United States Employment Service to accept voluntary services for a project. There is no indication of strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being conveyed. The order is factual and procedural in nature, so the scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1 and then revise them to 1 to reflect the lack of emotional content.",
