The primary goal is to convey a sense of importance, purpose, and confidence in the initiative. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are primarily joy (excitement about the future of quantum information science) and perhaps a touch of surprise (at the rapid advancements in the field). There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
