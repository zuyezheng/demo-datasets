    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Economic Policy Board. It outlines the structure, membership, and responsibilities of the board. The language is formal and bureaucratic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the creation of such a board could implicitly convey a sense of responsibility and determination to address economic issues. Considering the formal nature, the emotional scores should be low.",
