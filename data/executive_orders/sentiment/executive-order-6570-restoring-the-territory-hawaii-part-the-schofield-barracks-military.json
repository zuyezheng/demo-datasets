    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document detailing the transfer of land for the construction of a road. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue there's a hint of joy that the territory of Hawaii will be able to construct a road. There might be a tiny bit of surprise that the president is involved in such a detailed decision. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust.",
