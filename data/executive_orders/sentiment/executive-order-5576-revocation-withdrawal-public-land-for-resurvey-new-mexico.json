    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land use. It primarily conveys a neutral tone, focused on legal and administrative procedures. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is objective and procedural, aiming to inform and direct rather than evoke emotion. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the document's lack of emotional content. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion.",
