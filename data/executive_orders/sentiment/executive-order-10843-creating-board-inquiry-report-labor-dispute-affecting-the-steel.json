    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order creating a Board of Inquiry to address a labor dispute in the steel industry. The language is legalistic and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the implicit emotions are sadness and fear. The sadness comes from the fact that there is a labor dispute. The fear comes from the fact that the strike will, if permitted to continue, imperil the national health and safety. There is no indication of joy, disgust, or surprise.",
