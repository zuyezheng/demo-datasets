    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding import restrictions against Uganda due to human rights violations. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotions might be a mild sense of approval (joy) for addressing human rights or a mild sense of disapproval (disgust) towards the actions of the Ugandan government. Fear, sadness, and surprise are unlikely to be significant.",
