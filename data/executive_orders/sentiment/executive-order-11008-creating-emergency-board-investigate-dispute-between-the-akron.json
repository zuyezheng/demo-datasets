    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document addressing a labor dispute. It aims to convey a sense of authority, responsibility, and impartiality. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to ensure the continuation of essential transportation services by creating a board to investigate the dispute and prevent any changes to the conditions that led to it. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low.",
