It aims to reassure the public by outlining measures to enhance vetting and screening processes. The dominant emotion conveyed is fear, with a secondary emphasis on security and vigilance. There is no indication of joy, surprise, or sadness. Disgust might be present due to the mention of 'hateful ideology' and 'malevolent purposes,' but it's not the primary focus.",
