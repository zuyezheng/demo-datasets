    "critique": "The executive order focuses on protecting citizens from threats, which suggests the president wants the audience to feel safe and secure. This can be achieved by conveying a sense of fear regarding potential threats and then offering reassurance through the measures outlined in the order. The order also aims to evoke a sense of disgust towards those who intend to harm the nation. There is no indication that the president wants to evoke joy or surprise. Sadness might be a byproduct of acknowledging potential threats, but it is not the primary emotion to be conveyed.",
