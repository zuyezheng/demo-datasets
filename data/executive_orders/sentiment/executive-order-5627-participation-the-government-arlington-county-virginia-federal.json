    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and reasoned approval. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order focuses on a specific situation (Arlington County employees holding local office) and emphasizes adherence to civil service rules and avoiding conflicts of interest. The tone is formal and procedural, aiming for a neutral and balanced approach. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
