    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the distribution of funds related to the Virginius affair. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no overt expression of emotion. The President is directing a specific action (distribution of funds) and setting a deadline for claims. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be neutral. Since there is no information to suggest any of the emotions, I will assign a score of 1 for each.",
