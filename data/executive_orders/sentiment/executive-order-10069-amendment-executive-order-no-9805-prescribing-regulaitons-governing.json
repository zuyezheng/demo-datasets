While it doesn't explicitly evoke strong emotions, it subtly aims to instill a sense of trust and confidence in the government's processes. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed is joy, with a score of 3, as it brings a sense of relief and satisfaction that things are being handled correctly. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
