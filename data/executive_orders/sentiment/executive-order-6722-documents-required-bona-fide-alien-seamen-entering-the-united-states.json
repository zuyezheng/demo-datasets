    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the entry of alien seamen into the United States. It outlines regulations and procedures for their admission, visa requirements, and documentation. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, with no overt expression of emotion. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be 1, indicating a lack of conveyed emotion.",
