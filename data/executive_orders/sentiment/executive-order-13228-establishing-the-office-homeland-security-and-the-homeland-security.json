    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of security and preparedness in the face of terrorist threats. It should instill a sense of calm and confidence, not fear or panic. Therefore, the primary emotion should be joy (relief, security) with a secondary emotion of surprise (at the comprehensive nature of the response). There might be a very slight element of sadness acknowledging the events that led to this order, and a very slight element of fear acknowledging the threat. Disgust and anger are not relevant.",
