    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about exempting an employee from mandatory retirement. It is unlikely to make people feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low for all emotions. After further consideration, the scores should remain low, as the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any strong emotional response.",
