    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of urgency and hope. It highlights a problem (skills crisis) and proposes a solution (national strategy). The order should instill a sense of hope that the government is addressing the issue and preparing citizens for the future. There might be a touch of fear regarding the skills crisis, but the overall tone is optimistic and forward-looking. Disgust and surprise are not relevant emotions in this context.",
