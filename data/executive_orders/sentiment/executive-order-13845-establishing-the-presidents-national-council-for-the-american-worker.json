    "critique": "The document expresses concern about the skills crisis and the need to prepare American workers for the future economy. It conveys a sense of urgency and determination to address the issue. The President is attempting to portray a sense of hope and optimism that the situation can be improved through coordinated efforts. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed are concern/sadness about the current situation and hope/joy for the future. There is a hint of fear about the consequences of not addressing the skills gap, but it is not the dominant emotion. Disgust and surprise are not relevant in this context.",
