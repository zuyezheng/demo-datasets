    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focusing on policy and procedure. It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is about allowing government employees to participate in local elections under specific conditions, which is more about governance than emotional impact. However, a very slight sense of empowerment or relief might be present, but it's minimal. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for surprise, as the audience might be surprised by the allowance of government employees to participate in local elections.",
