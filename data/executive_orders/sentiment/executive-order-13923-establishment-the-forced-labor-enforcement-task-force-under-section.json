    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a task force to monitor the enforcement of the prohibition of forced labor. The language is legal and procedural. There is no explicit emotional sentiment conveyed. However, the subject matter (forced labor) can evoke negative emotions. Considering the likely public reaction, I will assign low scores for joy and surprise, and slightly higher scores for sadness, fear, and disgust due to the nature of forced labor.",
