    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It expresses a sense of urgency and authority, but avoids strong emotional language. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of concern (sadness) due to the potential disruption of transportation, and a hint of surprise that the dispute wasn't resolved earlier, but these are minimal. Disgust, fear, and joy are not present.",
