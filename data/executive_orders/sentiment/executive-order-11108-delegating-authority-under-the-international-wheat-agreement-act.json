    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the International Wheat Agreement. It delegates authority to the Secretary of Agriculture and outlines specific actions they are authorized to take. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, there might be a subtle sense of determination or resolve to fulfill the obligations of the agreement. Considering it's a formal document, the emotional scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on resolve.",
