    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the International Wheat Agreement. It primarily delegates authority to the Secretary of Agriculture and outlines the scope of that authority. The language is legal and procedural, lacking emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores are set to 1, indicating a neutral emotional impact. There's a slight possibility of surprise due to the specific nature of the order, but it's still very low.",
