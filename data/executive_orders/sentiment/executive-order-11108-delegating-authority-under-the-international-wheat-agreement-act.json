    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining the responsibilities and authorities related to the International Wheat Agreement. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of reassurance (low joy) due to the government taking action to manage wheat resources and fulfill international obligations. There might also be a very slight sense of surprise that the president is involved in wheat management.",
