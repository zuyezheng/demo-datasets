    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to establish standards for the formation, use, conduct, management, and accessibility of federal government committees. It is primarily informational and regulatory in nature. The intended emotional response is likely to be one of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage its advisory bodies effectively and transparently. There is a slight element of surprise, as the order introduces new guidelines and procedures. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, or disgust.",
