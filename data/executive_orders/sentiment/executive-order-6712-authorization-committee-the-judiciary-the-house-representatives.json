    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal declaration regarding tax return inspections by a House committee. It cites legal authority and outlines compliance procedures. The order does not seem designed to evoke strong emotions. A slight sense of surprise might be intended due to the specificity of the order. The order seems to be conveying information in a neutral tone, so I will revise the scores to reflect that.",
