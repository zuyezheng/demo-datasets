    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and legal action, rather than specific emotions. The language is formal and procedural. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for all emotions. Upon review, the initial scores seem appropriate given the nature of the document.",
