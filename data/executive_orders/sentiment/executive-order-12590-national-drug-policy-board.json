    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the National Drug Policy Board. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of seriousness and determination to address drug abuse. There is a slight sense of hope that the board will be effective. There is no explicit anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed, but there is an implicit sense of concern about the issue of drug abuse, which could be interpreted as a low level of fear and disgust. The document is formal and objective, so the scores should be relatively low.",
