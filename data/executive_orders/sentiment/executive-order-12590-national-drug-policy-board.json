    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing the National Drug Policy Board. It is a formal and legal document. The primary emotions conveyed would likely be concern (about drug abuse) and determination (to address the issue). However, the document itself is neutral in tone, so the emotional impact on the public would be relatively low. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions initially, and then revise them slightly upwards to reflect the underlying concern and determination.",
