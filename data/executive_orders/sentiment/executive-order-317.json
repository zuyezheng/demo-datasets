The order is about the participation of government departments in expositions. It is unlikely to make people feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low for all emotions. After further consideration, the order is still unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The revised scores should remain low.",
