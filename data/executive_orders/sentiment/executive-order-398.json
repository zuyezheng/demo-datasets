    "critique": "The executive order is about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, so the primary emotion conveyed should be sadness. There might also be a touch of surprise and fear, but sadness should be the most prominent. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the highest, followed by surprise and fear. The revised scores will slightly increase sadness and decrease surprise and fear to better reflect the overall tone.",
