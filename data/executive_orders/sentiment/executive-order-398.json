    "critique": "The document expresses sadness and somberness due to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The language used, such as 'great affliction' and 'lamented,' indicates a sense of sorrow and loss. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is expected to be high, as it commemorates the death of a president. The other emotions are not relevant in this context, so they should be scored as 1.",
