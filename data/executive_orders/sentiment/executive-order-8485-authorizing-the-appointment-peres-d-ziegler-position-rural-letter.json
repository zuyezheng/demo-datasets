Panay who was injured in the bombing and sinking of that vessel. The audience may feel joy because Mr. Ziegler is being appointed to a position as rural letter carrier in the Postal Service. The audience may also feel surprise because Mr. Ziegler is being appointed to a position without compliance with the requirements of the Civil Service Rules.",
