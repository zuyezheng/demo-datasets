    "critique": "The document expresses strong negative emotions towards illegal immigration, emphasizing the dangers and threats it poses to the United States. It uses terms like 'invasion,' 'potential terrorists,' 'foreign spies,' 'cartels,' 'gangs,' 'violent transnational criminal organizations,' and 'hostile actors' to create a sense of fear and disgust. The document also conveys a sense of sadness about the current state of border security and a determination to rectify the situation. There is a sense of urgency and resolve, but little joy or surprise.",
