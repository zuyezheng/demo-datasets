    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement regarding campaign medals. It does not seem to evoke strong emotions. The order primarily provides information about eligibility and dates, so it does not seem to want the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are all 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order does not strongly convey any of the emotions. Therefore, the revised scores will remain the same.",
