    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability, confidence, and perhaps a touch of reassurance that the government is handling trade matters responsibly. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on procedures and obligations rather than emotional appeals. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
