    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and importance. It establishes a commission and outlines its responsibilities. There's no obvious attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a very mild sense of hope or relief might be present due to the addressing of immigration issues. The order is more about conveying a sense of order and authority.",
