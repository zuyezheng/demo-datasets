    "critique": "The document discusses emergency conditions and restrictions on civil service examinations due to the international situation. The president conveys a sense of seriousness and urgency, but not necessarily strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed might be concern or seriousness, which could be interpreted as a mild form of fear or sadness, but it's more about the gravity of the situation. The scores should reflect this subdued emotional tone.",
