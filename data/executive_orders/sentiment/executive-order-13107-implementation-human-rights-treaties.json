    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the implementation of human rights obligations. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are joy and surprise. Joy that the government is committed to human rights, and surprise to show a new change. There may be a small amount of sadness for past failures to adhere to human rights, but this is not a primary emotion. There is no indication of fear, disgust, or anger.",
