    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Elk Refuge. It primarily uses legal and administrative language. There is no explicit emotional expression. However, one could argue there is a subtle sense of joy in preserving land for wildlife, but it is very subdued. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most scores should be very low.",
