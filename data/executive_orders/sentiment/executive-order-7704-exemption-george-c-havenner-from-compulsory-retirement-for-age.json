There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the act of extending someone's service might imply a sense of approval or satisfaction, but this is very subtle. Therefore, a low score is appropriate for joy. There's no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The score for these emotions should be 1.",
