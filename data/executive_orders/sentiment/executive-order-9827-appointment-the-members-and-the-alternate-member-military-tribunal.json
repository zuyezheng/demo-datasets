    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about the designation of members to military tribunals. It doesn't seem to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on the assignment of personnel and their compensation. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be very low. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily informational, the context of trying major war criminals could evoke a slight sense of justice or relief, which might translate to a very mild sense of joy or satisfaction for some. However, this is a subtle undertone and not the primary intent of the document.",
