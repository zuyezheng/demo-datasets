    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding watershed protection and flood prevention. It primarily focuses on administrative procedures, coordination between government departments, and legal amendments. The language is formal, technical, and devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be very low, close to 1, as the document is not designed to evoke any particular emotion.",
