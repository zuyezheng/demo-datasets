    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the death of ex-President Rutherford B. Hayes and instructions for mourning. It primarily conveys sadness due to the death, but also respect and solemnity. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is moderate, as it's a formal announcement rather than a personal expression of grief.",
