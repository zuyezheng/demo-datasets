    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage national defense. It uses formal language and emphasizes the importance of maintaining essential supplies and services. The order does not seem to want the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. However, there might be a slight element of surprise conveyed, as the order is responding to unforeseen circumstances that require government action. Therefore, I will score surprise as 3, and the rest as 1.",
