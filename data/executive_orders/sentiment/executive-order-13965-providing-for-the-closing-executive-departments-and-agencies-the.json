    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It declares that federal departments and agencies will be closed on December 24, 2020, the day before Christmas. There is a provision for essential services to remain open. The order also clarifies that employees will be paid according to existing regulations. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the order is related to Christmas, which is generally associated with joy. The order allows federal employees to have a day off before Christmas, which could be seen as a positive thing. However, the primary purpose of the document is to make a legal declaration, not to express emotion. Therefore, the scores should be low for all emotions except joy, which should be slightly higher.",
