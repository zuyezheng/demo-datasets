    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It amends a previous order to clarify responsibilities within the executive branch. There's no indication that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The order is formal and legalistic in tone, suggesting a desire for clarity and efficiency rather than emotional impact. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
