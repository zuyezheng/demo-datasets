    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily focuses on amending a previous executive order related to the North American Free Trade Agreement. The language is legal and administrative, with no strong emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering the formal nature, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for most emotions, increasing the score to 2 only for sadness because the document repeals a previous order.",
