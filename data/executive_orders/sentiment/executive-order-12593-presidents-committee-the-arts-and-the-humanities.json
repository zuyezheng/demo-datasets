    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous executive order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotions would be surprise, as the order changes the number of people on the committee, and perhaps a slight amount of joy if the reader supports the arts and humanities and believes this change will help. However, the intensity of these emotions would be low.",
