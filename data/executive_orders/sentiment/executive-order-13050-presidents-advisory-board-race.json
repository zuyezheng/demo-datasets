    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a President's Advisory Board on Race. It outlines the board's functions, administration, and general guidelines. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of hope and determination to address racial issues, but it is conveyed in a very measured and official tone. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise are all low. The document aims to promote understanding and bridge divides, suggesting a slightly elevated sense of hope or joy, but it's still relatively low due to the formal nature of the document.",
