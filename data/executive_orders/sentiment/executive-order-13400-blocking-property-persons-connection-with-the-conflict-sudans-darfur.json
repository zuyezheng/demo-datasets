    "critique": "The executive order discusses violence in Sudan's Darfur region, including sexual violence against women and girls. It aims to address a threat to national security and foreign policy. The order blocks property and interests of individuals who pose a threat to the peace process, stability, or are responsible for conduct related to the conflict. The intended emotions are likely sadness and fear due to the violence and threat, and perhaps disgust at the heinous conduct. There might also be a sense of surprise at the extent of the problem and the measures being taken. However, the primary emotions are sadness and fear. The order is written in a formal, legalistic tone, which tends to suppress strong emotional responses. The scores should reflect this.",
