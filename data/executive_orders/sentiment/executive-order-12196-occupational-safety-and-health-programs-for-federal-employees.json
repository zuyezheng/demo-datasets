    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding occupational safety and health in federal agencies. It primarily focuses on outlining responsibilities, procedures, and compliance measures. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of joy in ensuring safety and well-being, but it's very subtle. There is no indication of surprise, fear, disgust, or sadness.",
