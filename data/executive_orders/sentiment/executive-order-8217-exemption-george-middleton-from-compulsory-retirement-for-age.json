    "critique": "The executive order is a very formal and dry document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about exempting someone from retirement, which might evoke a tiny bit of joy in that person, but for the general public, it's unlikely to evoke any strong emotion. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board. Upon further reflection, the document is unlikely to evoke any emotions in the reader. The revised scores should be zero for all emotions.",
