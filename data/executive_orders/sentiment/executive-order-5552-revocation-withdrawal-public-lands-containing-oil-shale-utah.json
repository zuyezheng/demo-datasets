    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land allocation to Uncompahgre Ute Indians. It does not express any strong emotions. The emotions conveyed are very minimal, and I will assign a low score to each emotion. Since the document is formal and related to land allocation, I will assign a slightly higher score to sadness due to the historical context of land allocation to Native Americans.",
