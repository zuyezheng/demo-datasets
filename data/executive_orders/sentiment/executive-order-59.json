    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of resolution and perhaps cautious optimism regarding the well-being of the Mohave-Apache Indians. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal appears to be the allocation of land for the use and occupancy of the specified Native American tribes. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The initial scores are set to zero, and then adjusted slightly to reflect a minimal sense of hope and relief.",
