    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of official action and policy implementation rather than strong emotions. The President is setting aside land for the use of Mohave-Apache Indians and other Indians deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Interior. There is a slight hint of care or concern for the well-being of the Indians, but it is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the scores for emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise should be relatively low. I will start with initial scores of 1 across the board, and then revise based on the slight hint of care.",
