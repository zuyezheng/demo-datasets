    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President regarding land withdrawal for use as a target range. It's a legal and administrative document, so it doesn't express strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of decisiveness or authority, but it's very subdued. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for decisiveness which could be interpreted as a low level of joy.",
