    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document that formally withdraws land for use as a target range. It's unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The order is factual and procedural, so it doesn't aim to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be very low for all emotions. Upon further reflection, while the primary goal isn't to evoke emotion, there might be a slight sense of reassurance or security for those connected to the Idaho National Guard, knowing they have a designated target range. This could translate to a very minimal amount of joy or perhaps reduced fear (in the sense of preparedness). However, these would be extremely subtle.",
