Therefore, the emotional content is expected to be minimal. The document aims to convey a sense of authority and control, but not necessarily anger or fear. There might be a slight sense of concern for national defense, which could translate to a low level of fear or concern. Joy and surprise are unlikely to be present. Disgust is not applicable.",
