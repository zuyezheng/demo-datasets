It outlines the duties and responsibilities of various officials and departments in relation to foreign affairs. The language is formal and procedural, with no overt expression of emotions. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a neutral emotional tone. After further consideration, the document remains emotionally neutral, as it is a set of instructions and regulations. The revised scores remain unchanged.",
