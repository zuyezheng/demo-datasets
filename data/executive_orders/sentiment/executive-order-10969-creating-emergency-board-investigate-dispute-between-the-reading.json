    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding a labor dispute and the creation of a board to investigate it. The language is neutral and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with all emotions scored at 1. After further consideration, the initial scores accurately reflect the document's lack of emotional content, so the revised scores remain the same.",
