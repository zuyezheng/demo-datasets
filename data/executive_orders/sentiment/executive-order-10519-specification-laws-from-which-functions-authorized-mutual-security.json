It is primarily legal and administrative in nature. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and objective, focusing on legal and procedural aspects. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content.",
