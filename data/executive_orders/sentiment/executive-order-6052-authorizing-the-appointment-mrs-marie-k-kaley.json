The sadness stems from the widow's situation and the death of her husband, while the joy comes from the act of helping her. There might be a hint of surprise that such an order is needed. Disgust, fear, and anger don't seem to be relevant emotions here. Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 6, Surprise: 2, Disgust: 1, Fear: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 4, Sadness: 7, Surprise: 3, Disgust: 1, Fear: 1.",
