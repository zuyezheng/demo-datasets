    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability rather than strong emotions. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire to convey order and progress. Therefore, I would expect a low score for all emotions. My initial scores are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think there might be a slight element of hope or optimism (joy) intended, as the order aims to improve the industry. I will adjust the joy score to 2.",
