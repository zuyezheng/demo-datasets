    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding civil service rules. It revokes a previous order that had exempted certain positions at the United States Naval Academy from the competitive classified service. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, a sense of satisfaction or decisiveness might be inferred from the act of correcting a previous exception. Considering the formal nature, the intensity of any emotion would be low.",
