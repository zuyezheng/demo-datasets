    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order revokes a previous exception to civil service rules, returning certain positions to the competitive classified service. This might bring a slight sense of joy to those who believe in the merit system, and perhaps a touch of sadness or surprise to those who benefited from the exception. However, the overall emotional impact is minimal.",
