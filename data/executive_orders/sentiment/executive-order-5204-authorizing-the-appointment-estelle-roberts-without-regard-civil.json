    "critique": "The executive order is about the appointment of a widow of a deceased Immigration Patrol Inspector. The order expresses sympathy for the widow and aims to provide her with a position. It does not explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. However, it may evoke some sadness and perhaps a touch of joy that the widow is being taken care of. Surprise, disgust, fear, and anger are not relevant emotions in this context. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
