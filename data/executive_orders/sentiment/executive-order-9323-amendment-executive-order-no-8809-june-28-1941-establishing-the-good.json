    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of duty, honor, and perhaps a touch of relief or satisfaction for those who have served. There's no strong indication of intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotions would be joy that soldiers are being recognized and a small amount of surprise that the criteria for the medal have changed during the war. The intensity of these emotions is relatively low, as the order is more about formalizing a process.",
