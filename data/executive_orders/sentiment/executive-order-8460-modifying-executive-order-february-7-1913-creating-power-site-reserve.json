Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After further consideration, I still believe that the document is purely informational and devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
