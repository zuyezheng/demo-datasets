    "critique": "The document is a formal notification regarding the closure of government departments for the decoration of soldiers' graves. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the remembrance of soldiers who died in the rebellion. There might be a hint of joy in celebrating their lives, but sadness is more prominent. There is no explicit anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document. Therefore, I will assign low scores to these emotions.",
