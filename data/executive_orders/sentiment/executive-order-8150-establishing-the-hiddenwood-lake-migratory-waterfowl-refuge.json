    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of joy and surprise at the creation of a wildlife refuge. There might be a touch of sadness for the animals that were previously unprotected, and perhaps a hint of fear for those who might violate the rules. Disgust and anger don't seem to be primary emotions the order is trying to evoke. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the joy and surprise, while decreasing the sadness and fear, as the overall tone is more positive and proactive.",
