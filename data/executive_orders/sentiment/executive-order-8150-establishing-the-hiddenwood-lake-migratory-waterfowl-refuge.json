    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration establishing a wildlife refuge. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the act of protecting wildlife could be interpreted as conveying a sense of joy and care for nature, but this is very subtle. Therefore, the initial scores are set to low values, with joy slightly higher than the others. After a second thought, I realized that the document is very neutral, and all emotions should be set to 1.",
