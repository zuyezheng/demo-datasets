    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the End Grain Strip Wood Block Industry. The language is legal and administrative, with no emotional tone. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions scored at 1. After further consideration, the lack of emotional language and the formal nature of the document reinforce the initial assessment. Therefore, the revised scores remain the same.",
