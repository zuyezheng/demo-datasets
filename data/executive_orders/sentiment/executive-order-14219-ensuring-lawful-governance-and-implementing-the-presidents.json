    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a clear intent to reduce federal overreach and restore constitutional separation of powers. There's a sense of determination and purpose, but emotions are largely suppressed in favor of a professional tone. Joy is low as it's not celebratory. Sadness is low as it's not lamenting anything. Fear is low as it's not expressing anxiety. Disgust is moderate as it targets 'overbearing and burdensome' regulations. Surprise is low as it's a planned policy.",
