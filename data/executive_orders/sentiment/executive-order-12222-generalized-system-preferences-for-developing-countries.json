It primarily focuses on trade regulations and modifications to existing executive orders and tariff schedules. The language is legal and procedural, with no overt emotional expression. Therefore, the scores should reflect the absence of strong emotions, with a baseline of 1 for each emotion due to the formal nature of the document.",
