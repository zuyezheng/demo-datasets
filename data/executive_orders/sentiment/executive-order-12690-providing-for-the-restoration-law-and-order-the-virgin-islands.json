    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of control and resolution in response to domestic violence and disorder. It uses formal and authoritative language. The primary emotion the president wants to convey is a sense of quelling fear and restoring order. There might also be a hint of sadness that such measures are necessary, but it's less prominent. There is no indication of joy or surprise. Disgust might be present, but it is not explicitly stated.",
