    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal in New Mexico. It uses legal and administrative language. There is no explicit expression of emotion. The expected emotional response from the public would likely be neutral, as it's a routine administrative action. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After further consideration, since this is a formal order with no emotional language, a score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions.",
