It seeks to reassure the public that the shift from wartime to peacetime production will be managed effectively, avoiding chaos and ensuring continued economic stability. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with secondary emotions of surprise. The order does not want to convey sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
