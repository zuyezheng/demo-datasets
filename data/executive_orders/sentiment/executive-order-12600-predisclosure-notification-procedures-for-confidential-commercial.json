    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the Freedom of Information Act. It is primarily concerned with establishing procedures for handling confidential commercial information. The language is legalistic and procedural, lacking any overt emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most emotions should be scored as 1, indicating a very low level of intensity.",
