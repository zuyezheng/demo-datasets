    "critique": "The executive order is a technical amendment to a previous order regarding army rations. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such a specific detail is being addressed at the presidential level, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, I will score all emotions very low initially and then revise to be even lower after considering the lack of emotional content.",
