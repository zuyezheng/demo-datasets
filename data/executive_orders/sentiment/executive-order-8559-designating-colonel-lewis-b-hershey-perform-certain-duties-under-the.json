    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about the appointment of an interim director for the Selective Service. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Maybe a tiny bit of surprise that it is so formal. The order is very procedural and legalistic, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be surprise, but even that would be minimal.",
