    "critique": "The executive order is a dry, technical document about land withdrawal. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such a document exists, but even that is a stretch. The initial scores should be very low across the board. After reflection, I still believe the scores should be very low, as the document is not designed to evoke any particular emotion.",
