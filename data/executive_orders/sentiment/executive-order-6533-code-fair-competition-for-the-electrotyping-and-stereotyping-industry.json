    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, progress, and confidence in the government's actions during the Great Depression. It's about implementing a code of fair competition, so it should evoke a sense of hope and perhaps mild surprise that the government is taking such action. There's no intention to evoke sadness, disgust, or fear. Joy might be a stretch, but a mild sense of optimism could be intended.",
