The intended emotions are likely neutral, but there might be a slight sense of joy for those who support the school and perhaps sadness or anger from those who oppose it. However, without further context, a neutral response is most appropriate. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1.",
