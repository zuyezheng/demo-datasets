    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement of the death of Lewis Cass and a directive for honoring his memory. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the loss of a respected figure. There might be a sense of respect and solemnity, but joy, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with sadness being the most prominent emotion.",
