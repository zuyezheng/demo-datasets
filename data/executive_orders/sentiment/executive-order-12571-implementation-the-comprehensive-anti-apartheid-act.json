    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the implementation of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. It primarily assigns responsibilities to various departments and agencies. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Considering this is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for most emotions, increasing the score only if there is a clear indication of that emotion being conveyed. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign a score of 1 for each of these emotions.",
