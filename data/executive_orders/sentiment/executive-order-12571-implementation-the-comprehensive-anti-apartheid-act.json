    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the implementation of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. It is a formal, legal document that assigns responsibilities to various government departments. The language is neutral and objective, with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most emotions should be scored as 1, indicating a very low level of intensity. There might be a slight sense of surprise or interest depending on the reader's awareness of the historical context of the Anti-Apartheid Act, but this would still be relatively low.",
