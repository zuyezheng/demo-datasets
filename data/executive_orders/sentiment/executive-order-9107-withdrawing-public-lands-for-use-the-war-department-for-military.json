It's a legal and administrative document, so the primary emotions conveyed are neutral. There is a slight sense of importance or urgency due to the military purpose, but it's not strongly emphasized. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions except for surprise, which I will set to 1 due to lack of information.",
