    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding the reporting functions of the Foreign Service. It outlines procedures for obtaining foreign data and assigning priorities to requests. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a base score of 1 for all emotions initially. Upon review, the document's serious and official tone might evoke a slight sense of concern or caution, so I will adjust the fear score to 2.",
