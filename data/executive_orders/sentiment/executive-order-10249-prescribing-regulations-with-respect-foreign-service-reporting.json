    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding the reporting functions of the Foreign Service. It primarily focuses on data collection and coordination between the Department of State and other federal agencies. The language is formal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the emotion scores should be low across the board, with a baseline of 1 for each emotion due to the inherent formality of the document.",
