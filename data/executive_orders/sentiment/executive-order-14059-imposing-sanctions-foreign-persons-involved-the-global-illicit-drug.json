    "critique": "The document expresses concern and determination to address the drug crisis. It highlights the deaths and overdoses caused by illicit drugs and declares a national emergency. The President aims to convey a sense of urgency and resolve in tackling this issue. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed are fear and sadness, with a touch of anger towards those responsible for drug trafficking. There is no indication of joy or surprise. Disgust is also present, directed towards the drug cartels and their actions. The initial scores reflect these observations. The revised scores aim to more accurately reflect the intensity of each emotion based on the document's content and context.",
