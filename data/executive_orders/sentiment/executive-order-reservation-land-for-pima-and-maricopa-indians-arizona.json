    "critique": "The document is a legal order describing land being set aside for the Pima and Maricopa Indians. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise or perhaps even a little joy that the land is being used for the benefit of the Native Americans. However, the language is very formal and detached, so the intensity of any emotion is likely to be low.",
