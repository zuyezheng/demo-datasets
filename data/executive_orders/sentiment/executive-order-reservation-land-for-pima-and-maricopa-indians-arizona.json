    "critique": "The executive order primarily focuses on land allocation for the Pima and Maricopa Indians. It's a formal declaration, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, it could bring a sense of joy and surprise to the Pima and Maricopa Indians. It could bring a sense of sadness and disgust to those who had hoped to acquire the land for other purposes. It is unlikely to evoke fear.",
