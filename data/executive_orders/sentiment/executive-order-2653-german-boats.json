    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to instill a sense of resolve and perhaps a touch of fear/awe regarding the government's power during wartime. It's a formal declaration, so joy is unlikely. There might be a hint of disgust towards the enemy, but it's not overt. Surprise isn't a primary emotion here; it's more about asserting authority and taking necessary actions.",
