    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that amends the Military Rules of Evidence. The intended audience is legal professionals and members of the military justice system. The document aims to provide clarity and updates to legal procedures. The primary emotions the president wants to convey are trust and confidence in the legal system. There is no intention to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is formal and technical, focusing on legal precision rather than emotional appeal. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
