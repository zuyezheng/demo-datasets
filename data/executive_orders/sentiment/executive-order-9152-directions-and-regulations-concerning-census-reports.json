    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of serious resolve and perhaps a touch of concern given the context of war. It's unlikely to evoke joy. Sadness might be a very mild undercurrent due to the sacrifices implied by war. Anger isn't a primary emotion here, nor is disgust. Fear is possible, given the war context, and surprise is unlikely. Thus, I'll focus on fear and sadness, with a touch of seriousness.",
