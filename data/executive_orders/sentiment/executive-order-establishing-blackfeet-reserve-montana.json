    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of administrative action and policy implementation. There's a formal tone with the description of land and recommendations. The emotions that the public might feel are minimal, as it's a factual record. Surprise, disgust, fear, joy and sadness are not explicitly conveyed, so I will assign a low initial score of 1 for each. After further consideration, the document's impact on different groups could evoke varying emotions. Native American tribes might experience a mix of relief and apprehension, while settlers could feel resentment or disappointment. However, without specific emotional cues in the text, maintaining low scores is appropriate.",
