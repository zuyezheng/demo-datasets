    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim at conveying a sense of resolution and perhaps a touch of hope, but also potential sadness and fear due to the displacement of people. The order establishes a reservation for several Native American tribes, which could bring joy to those tribes. However, it also withholds the land from entry and settlement as public lands, which might cause sadness or fear for potential settlers. There's a slight element of surprise as the order formalizes a significant land allocation. Disgust and anger are less prominent but could be felt by those negatively affected by the order.",
