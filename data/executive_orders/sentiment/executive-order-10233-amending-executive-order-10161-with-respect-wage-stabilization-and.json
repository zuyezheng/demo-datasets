    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of stability, control, and fairness. It establishes a board to handle labor disputes and maintain wage stabilization, which should ideally reduce fear and disgust related to economic instability. There's no intention to evoke joy or surprise, as the order is a formal and serious matter. A touch of sadness might be present due to the limitations imposed on free collective bargaining, but it's minimal. Therefore, I'll score fear and disgust relatively low, sadness even lower, and joy and surprise at zero. After a second thought, the order is trying to instill confidence and reduce fear, so fear should be even lower. The order is also trying to prevent scenarios that would cause disgust. The order is very unlikely to cause joy, sadness, or surprise.",
