The primary goal is to inform, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a slight sense of surprise due to the specific nature of the details, but the intensity would still be minimal.",
