    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal and administrative document. It references specific sections of law and previous executive orders, focusing on the administration of the Wool Textile Code. The language is precise and legalistic, with no apparent attempt to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. Therefore, the appropriate scores for all emotions should be very low, as the document is primarily informational and procedural.",
