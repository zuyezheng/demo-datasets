    "critique": "The executive order seems to evoke a sense of concern and perhaps a little fear due to the military purposes mentioned, but overall it's a very neutral document. The order itself doesn't explicitly aim to evoke any strong emotions. The primary purpose is to legally designate land for military use. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board, with a slight emphasis on fear due to the military aspect.",
