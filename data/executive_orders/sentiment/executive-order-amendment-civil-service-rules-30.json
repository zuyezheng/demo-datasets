    "critique": "The document discusses the employment of graduates from Indian schools as teachers. It focuses on rules and regulations for their employment and promotion within the Indian-school service. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, typical of official documents. Therefore, the sentiment conveyed is neutral, and the intensity of each emotion is expected to be low.",
