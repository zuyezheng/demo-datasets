    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to Indian Rule IV, focusing on the employment of graduates from Indian normal schools and other Indian schools as teachers. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document primarily deals with regulations and procedures for employment. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content.",
