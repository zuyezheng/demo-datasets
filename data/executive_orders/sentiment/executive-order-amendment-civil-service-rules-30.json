    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of progress and opportunity for Native American graduates, but it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Joy might be present due to the opportunity, but it's not a primary emotion. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should reflect this, with a low score for joy and zero for other emotions. Upon revision, I'll slightly increase the joy score to acknowledge the positive aspect of the order.",
