    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to the Tariff of United States Consular Fees. It involves changes to specific items related to visa fees for Chinese passports and affidavits of identity. There is no explicit emotional language or sentiment expressed in the document. The language is neutral and factual, focusing on the details of the fee changes. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The most appropriate scores would be low across all emotions, with a score of 1 indicating minimal emotional impact.",
