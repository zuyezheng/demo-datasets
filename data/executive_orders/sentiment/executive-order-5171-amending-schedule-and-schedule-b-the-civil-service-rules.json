    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding changes to civil service rules within the State Department. It revokes an exception for certain officers, grants classified status to specific individuals, and adds a new subdivision for specialists in foreign relations. The language is formal and administrative, with no overt expression of emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering the formal nature of the document, a score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions to indicate a minimal presence.",
