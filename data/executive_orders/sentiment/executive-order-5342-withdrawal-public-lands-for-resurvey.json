    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document about land withdrawal in Arkansas. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform about a specific action (land withdrawal) and its legal basis. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially, as there might be a very slight sense of surprise for someone directly affected, but it's minimal. Upon further consideration, the order is unlikely to evoke any emotions. The act is simply a legal procedure. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
