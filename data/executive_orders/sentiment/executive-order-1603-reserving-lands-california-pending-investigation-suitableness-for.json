    "critique": "The document is a presidential order regarding land allocation for homeless Paiute or other Indians. It's a formal, legal document. The primary emotions conveyed would likely be interpreted as a mild sense of hope or relief for the affected population, but the document itself is neutral. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust and surprise are all low.The initial scores reflect this assessment. The revised scores are similar, with a slight increase in joy to reflect the positive impact on the intended recipients.",
