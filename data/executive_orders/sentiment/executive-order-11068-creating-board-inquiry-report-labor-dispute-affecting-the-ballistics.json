It's a formal declaration addressing a labor dispute that affects national security. The primary emotion might be concern or seriousness, but not to a high degree. There might be a touch of surprise that such action is needed. The order does not want to invoke joy. It may invoke slight sadness, fear, and disgust, but these are not the primary emotions. The order wants to invoke slight surprise that such action is needed.",
