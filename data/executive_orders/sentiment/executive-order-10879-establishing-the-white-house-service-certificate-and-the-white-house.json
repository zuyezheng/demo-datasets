    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of honor, respect, and gratitude towards those serving in the White House. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is a mild sense of respect and perhaps a touch of gratitude. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy to represent the positive recognition.",
