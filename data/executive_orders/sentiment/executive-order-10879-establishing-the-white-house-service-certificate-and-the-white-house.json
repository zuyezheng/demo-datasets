    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the White House Service Certificate and Badge. The language is formal and bureaucratic. The order seems to convey a sense of respect and honor for those serving in the White House. There is no indication of negative emotions such as sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not relevant in this context. The primary emotion conveyed is joy, albeit in a formal and understated way. Therefore, I will assign a low score for joy and a score of 1 for all other emotions.",
