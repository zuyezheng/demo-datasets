    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the National Council on Indian Opportunity. It aims to coordinate federal programs to benefit the Indian population. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is a sense of hope and purpose, but it is conveyed in a very measured and official tone. Therefore, joy, surprise, sadness, disgust, and fear should all be relatively low. The document expresses a mild sense of hope and determination to improve the situation for the Indian population, so I will assign a slightly higher score for joy.",
