    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Lumber and Timber Products Industries. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment in implementing the National Industrial Recovery Act. Based on this, the expected emotions from the public would be minimal, with a slight sense of joy that the government is working. The initial scores are: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 2, sadness: 1, surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the document is purely procedural and unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. Therefore, all scores should be set to 1.",
