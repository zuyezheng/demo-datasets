    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical modification to a previous order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order modifies paragraphs 3 and 4 of Executive Order No. 7070, which deals with regulations governing appointments of employees paid from emergency funds. The modification makes the paragraphs inapplicable to transfers of persons in part-time positions or at wages fixed pursuant to Executive Order No. 7046. There is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is simply a technical adjustment.",
