It grants the Committee on Public Works the authority to inspect tax returns for specific years as part of their investigation into the Federal-Aid Highway Program. The language is very formal and procedural. There is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
