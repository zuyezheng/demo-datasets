    "critique": "The document expresses a sense of urgency and determination to address a critical situation (coal mine strikes) affecting the war effort and national economy. It invokes presidential power and outlines specific actions to be taken by the Secretary of the Interior. The overall tone is serious and focused on maintaining stability and order during a transition period.The primary emotion conveyed is concern and determination, with elements of potential fear (of economic disruption) and perhaps a hint of surprise (at the extent of the labor unrest). However, the document is largely devoid of strong emotional language, focusing instead on the legal and practical aspects of the situation. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect moderate levels of fear and concern, with low scores for other emotions.Revised scores will slightly increase the fear and concern scores to reflect the gravity of the situation, while keeping other scores low.",
