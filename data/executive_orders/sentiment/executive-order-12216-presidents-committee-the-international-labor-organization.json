    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and confidence in the government's actions regarding international labor standards. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild element, as the order formalizes a committee, but it's not a primary goal. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order and responsibility.",
