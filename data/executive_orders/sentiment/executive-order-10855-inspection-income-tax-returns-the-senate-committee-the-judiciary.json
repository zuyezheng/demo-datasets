    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal and legal document. It cites specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code and describes the authorization for the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to inspect income tax returns. The language is very technical and procedural. Therefore, it is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate a legal decision in a clear and precise manner.",
