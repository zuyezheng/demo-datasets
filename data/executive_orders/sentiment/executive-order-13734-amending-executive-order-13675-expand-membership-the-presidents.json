    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on promoting economic growth and job creation in the US and Africa. The language is formal and policy-oriented. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of optimism and determination to improve economic conditions through trade and investment. There's a hint of joy in anticipating the positive outcomes of the initiative, but overall, the tone is measured and professional.I will score the emotions based on this analysis. Disgust, fear, and sadness are not relevant in this context, so they will be scored low. Surprise is also not a primary emotion, but there might be a slight element of it due to the expansion of the council. Joy is present but not overwhelming, and the focus is more on the potential for positive outcomes. Therefore, I will give joy a moderate score.",
