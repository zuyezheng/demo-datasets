The language is formal and objective, with no strong emotional expressions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering the purpose of the document, a slight degree of joy might be present due to the positive outlook on economic growth and job creation. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
