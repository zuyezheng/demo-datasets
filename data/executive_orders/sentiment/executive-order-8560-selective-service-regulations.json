    "critique": "The executive order is a very dry, technical document. It is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions in the reader. The purpose of the document is to lay out the rules and regulations for the Selective Service Act of 1940. The order is very detailed and specific, and it is not intended to be read by the general public. The order is intended to be read by the people who are responsible for administering the Selective Service Act. Therefore, the emotions that the president wants to convey are probably none. The order is simply a set of instructions.",
