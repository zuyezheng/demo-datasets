    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration about reserving Miraflores Island for public health purposes. It invokes legal authority and specifies the intended use of the land. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the formal and legal nature of the document, the emotional intensity is minimal. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a very low level of emotional expression. After further consideration, the initial scores accurately reflect the lack of emotional content in the document.",
