    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a sense of decisiveness and authority, but avoids strong emotional language. The primary emotion conveyed, albeit subtly, is a sense of disapproval or dissatisfaction with the previous policy, which could be interpreted as mild disgust or sadness that the previous council was not effective. There's also a hint of surprise that the previous policy did not yield the desired results, but this is very mild. There is no explicit joy, fear, or anger expressed.",
