It does not seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, a very slight sense of reassurance might be intended, suggesting order and process. Therefore, I will assign a low score to joy and leave the rest at zero. After further consideration, even the slight sense of reassurance is not really present. The document is purely procedural. Therefore, all scores should be zero.",
