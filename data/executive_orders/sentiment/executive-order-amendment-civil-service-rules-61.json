The amendment concerns the reinstatement of honorably discharged veterans of the Civil War, without regard to the length of their separation from service. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a slight sense of joy and gratitude towards veterans, but it is very mild. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
