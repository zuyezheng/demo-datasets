However, the language is formal and bureaucratic, which might temper strong emotional responses. The order addresses a specific situation (reinstatement of veterans) and aims to correct a previous limitation, suggesting a potential element of surprise or relief that the issue is being addressed. There's no indication of negative emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
