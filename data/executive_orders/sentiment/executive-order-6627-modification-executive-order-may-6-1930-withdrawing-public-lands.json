    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that modifies a previous order to permit the issuance of an airport lease. The language is formal and factual, and the purpose is to make a specific change to land use regulations. Therefore, the order is not intended to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. The initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the scores should be low, as the document is purely administrative and not designed to elicit any emotional response.",
