    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and stability rather than strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform about an exemption, not to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The order is a formal announcement, so it should not evoke strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this, and the revised scores will be similar, with slight adjustments to ensure they are appropriately low.",
