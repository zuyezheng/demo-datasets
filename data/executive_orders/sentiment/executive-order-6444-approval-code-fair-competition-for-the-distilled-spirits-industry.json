    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration by President Roosevelt regarding the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Distilled Spirits Industry. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of satisfaction and perhaps slight joy in enacting policy. The lack of explicit emotional language suggests low scores for most emotions. The initial scores reflect this baseline, with slight adjustments made in the revised scores to account for the implicit positive sentiment associated with policy approval.",
