    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the line of succession for the Secretary of the Interior. It is a legal and administrative document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotions present, if any, would be related to a sense of duty, responsibility, or perhaps a mild sense of confidence in ensuring the continuity of government. However, these emotions are very muted. Therefore, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for most emotions. There might be a very slight sense of confidence or assurance, but it's minimal.",
