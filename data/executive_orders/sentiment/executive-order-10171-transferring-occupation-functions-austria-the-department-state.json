    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration regarding the responsibilities and obligations of the United States in connection with the occupation of Austria. It outlines the roles of different departments and officials. The order does not seem to evoke strong emotions. Perhaps a touch of surprise that such an order is being issued, but overall it is a very neutral document.",
