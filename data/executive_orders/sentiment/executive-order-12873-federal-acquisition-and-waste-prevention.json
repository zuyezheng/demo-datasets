The primary goal is to convey a sense of responsibility, efficiency, and environmental consciousness. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are primarily joy (in the sense of satisfaction from doing good) and perhaps a touch of surprise at the extent of the changes. There is no intention to evoke sadness, fear, disgust, or anger.",
