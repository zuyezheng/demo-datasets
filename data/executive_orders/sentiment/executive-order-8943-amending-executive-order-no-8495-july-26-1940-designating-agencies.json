    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order regarding the purchase and delivery of supplies for refugees. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the context of providing relief to refugees suggests a degree of sadness and perhaps a desire to alleviate suffering. Given the formal tone, the intensity of these emotions is likely low. Therefore, I will assign low scores to sadness and a minimal score to joy, fear, disgust, and surprise.",
