    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a technical document focused on amending the Manual for Courts-Martial. It's unlikely the president intends to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order seems purely administrative and legal in nature, with the primary goal of updating procedures and ensuring a smooth transition. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
