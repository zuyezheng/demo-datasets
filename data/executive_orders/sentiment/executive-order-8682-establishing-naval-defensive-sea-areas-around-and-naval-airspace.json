It invokes legal authority and outlines restrictions and penalties for violations. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of seriousness and resolve in protecting national interests. There is a hint of fear due to the mention of national defense, but it is not the dominant emotion. There is no explicit joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise.",
