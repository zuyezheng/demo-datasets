    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to instill a sense of respect and gratitude towards those who have been wounded or killed in service. While there's an element of sadness associated with loss, the overall tone is one of honor and duty. There might be a slight element of surprise that this order is being updated, but it is not the main emotion. Disgust, fear, and joy are not emotions the president wants the audience to feel after reading the executive order.",
