The intended emotions are likely to be a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect its waters. There might also be a sense of caution or respect for the regulations outlined in the order. It is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, or surprise. Fear and disgust are possible but less likely, depending on the reader's perspective.",
