While it's a mundane topic, the act of preventing someone's retirement could evoke a slight sense of joy or relief. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but unlikely, given the bureaucratic nature of the order. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
