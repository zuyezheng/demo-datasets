    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order, primarily concerned with transferring and reassigning statistical policy functions. It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and objective, focusing on the transfer of authority and responsibilities. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions. Revised scores will reflect this assessment.",
