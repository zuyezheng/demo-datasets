The primary emotion it aims to convey is a sense of respect and gratitude for the meritorious service of members of the Armed Forces. There might be a hint of joy in recognizing and rewarding outstanding achievements. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not the primary goal, but the announcement itself might generate some surprise.",
