The order aims to evoke a sense of solemnity and respect rather than strong emotions. The initial scores reflect a baseline level of sadness and respect, with minimal levels of other emotions. The revised scores maintain the focus on sadness and respect, with slight adjustments to reflect the overall tone of the document.",
