    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It amends a previous executive order to include the Defense Mapping Agency Reston Center and elements under the operational control of the Joint Special Operations Command under the umbrella of intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Considering the context, a slight sense of decisiveness and firmness might be present, but it's very subtle. Therefore, I will keep all the initial scores at 1.",
