It primarily focuses on defining roles, responsibilities, and procedures within the Foreign Service, including appointments, examinations, promotions, retirement, and compensation. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no overt expression of emotions. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the document's objective and formal nature.",
