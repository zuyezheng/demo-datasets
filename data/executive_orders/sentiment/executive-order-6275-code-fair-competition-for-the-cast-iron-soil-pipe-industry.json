    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Cast Iron Soil Pipe Industry by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The language is formal and legalistic, indicating a sense of duty and compliance with the National Industrial Recovery Act. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the act of approving a code of fair competition could be interpreted as a positive step towards economic recovery and stability, potentially evoking a sense of hope or relief. Given the context of the Great Depression, such measures would likely be met with cautious optimism. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise, and very low scores to the other emotions.",
