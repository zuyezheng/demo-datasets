    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and purpose in streamlining government operations. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely in such a formal context. The language is very neutral and factual. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with low scores for all emotions.",
