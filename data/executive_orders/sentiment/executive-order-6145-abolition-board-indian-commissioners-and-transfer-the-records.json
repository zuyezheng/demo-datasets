    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the abolition of the Board of Indian Commissioners. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, with the purpose of outlining the reasons and procedures for the action. There is no explicit emotional language used. The expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal, as it is a relatively obscure administrative matter. However, depending on one's views on Native American affairs, one might feel slight sadness or perhaps even a sense of surprise. Given the lack of emotional content, the scores should be low across the board. I will revise the scores to reflect a slightly higher level of sadness and surprise, acknowledging the potential impact on Native American affairs.",
