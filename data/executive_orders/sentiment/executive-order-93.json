    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability, security, and perhaps a touch of hope or relief among the residents of Puerto Rico. It establishes a clear process for obtaining protection under the United States flag, which could instill confidence and reduce uncertainty. There isn't a strong emphasis on any particular emotion, but a subtle sense of reassurance and order seems to be the goal. Therefore, I will adjust the scores to reflect a low level of joy and surprise, and minimal levels of other emotions.",
