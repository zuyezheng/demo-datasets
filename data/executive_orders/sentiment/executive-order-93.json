    "critique": "The document outlines regulations for vessels owned by residents of Puerto Rico following its cession to the United States. It focuses on legal and administrative procedures, such as issuing certificates of protection and defining eligibility criteria based on citizenship and allegiance. The language is formal and bureaucratic, typical of legal documents. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to establish clear guidelines and ensure compliance with the new governance structure. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional presence.",
