There is no explicit expression of emotions. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Considering that the document is related to fighting diseases, a slight sense of hope (joy) and concern (sadness) might be present, but they are minimal. Surprise, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context.",
