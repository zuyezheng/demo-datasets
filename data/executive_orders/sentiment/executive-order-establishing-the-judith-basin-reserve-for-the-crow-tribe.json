    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Crow tribe of Indians. It primarily focuses on geographical details and legal specifications. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise within the text. The language is neutral and objective, aiming to establish a clear legal framework. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default score of 1 due to the lack of emotional content.",
