    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and stability by preserving land for the Crow tribe. It does not seem to want to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal appears to be to communicate a decision in a clear and official manner. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Revised scores reflect a more nuanced understanding, slightly increasing the surprise score to acknowledge the potential unexpectedness of the order for some individuals.",
