    "critique": "The executive order appears to aim to convey a sense of resolution and finality regarding the land allocation for the Flathead tribe. It outlines the decision not to create a separate reservation in the Bitter Root Valley and directs the relocation of the residing Indians. The order also includes provisions for appraising improvements made by the Indians and allowing some to become citizens and remain on the land. The intended emotions are likely a mix of sadness (for the displacement), and perhaps a touch of surprise that some may be allowed to stay if they become citizens. There's also a hint of disgust at the situation. There's no explicit attempt to evoke joy or fear.",
