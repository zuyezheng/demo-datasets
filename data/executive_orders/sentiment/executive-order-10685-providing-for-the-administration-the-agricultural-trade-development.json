    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that designates the International Cooperation Administration as the Federal agency to which funds can be transferred. It also amends a previous executive order. The language is very legal and procedural, and it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion would be surprise, as the audience may not expect such an action. However, the intensity would be very low.",
