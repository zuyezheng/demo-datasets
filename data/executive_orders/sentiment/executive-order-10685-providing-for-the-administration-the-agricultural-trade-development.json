It primarily deals with the designation of a Federal agency for handling funds related to the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act. The language is legal and procedural, lacking strong emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of importance or authority, but it's minimal.",
