    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order transferring responsibilities from the Secretary of State to the Attorney General. The language is legal and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the context of the First War Powers Act suggests a backdrop of concern and urgency related to national security during wartime. This might imply a low level of fear and perhaps a touch of determination (which could be interpreted as a muted form of joy/confidence). Given the formal nature, most emotions should be scored very low.",
