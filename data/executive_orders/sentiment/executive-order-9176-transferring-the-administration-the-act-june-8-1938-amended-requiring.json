    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order transferring responsibilities related to the registration of agents of foreign principals from the Secretary of State to the Attorney General. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a low score of 1 for all emotions initially, as there is not enough information to suggest any specific emotional response. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
