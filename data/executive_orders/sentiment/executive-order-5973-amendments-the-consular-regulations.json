    "critique": "The document is a set of amendments to consular regulations. It is primarily informative and procedural, lacking strong emotional cues. The language is formal and legalistic. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a base score of 1 for all emotions initially, as the document does not explicitly evoke any particular emotion. Upon further consideration, the document's regulatory nature might induce a slight sense of surprise or perhaps even fear in those directly affected by the changes, such as naturalized citizens or those seeking passports. However, these emotions would likely be mild. Therefore, I will adjust the surprise and fear scores slightly upward, while keeping the other scores at 1.",
