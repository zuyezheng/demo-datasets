    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation for the Jicarilla Apache Indians. It primarily serves an administrative function. There's no explicit emotional language used. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a low score of 1 for all emotions initially. Upon further reflection, while the document itself is neutral, the act of setting aside land for Native Americans could evoke a slight sense of joy in some, and perhaps sadness or disgust in others depending on their views. However, without further context, these emotions would likely be mild. Therefore, I will keep the scores at 1 across the board.",
