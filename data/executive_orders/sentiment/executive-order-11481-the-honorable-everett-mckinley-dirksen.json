    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order to fly the flag at half-staff in memory of Everett McKinley Dirksen. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death of a respected public figure. There might be a hint of respect and solemnity, but sadness is the most prominent emotion. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign a low score to sadness and a score of 1 to the other emotions.",
