    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate a dispute between the Long Island Rail Road and its employees. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no strong emotional content. A score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions except perhaps a slight sense of concern or seriousness, which might justify a 2 for sadness. However, given the formal nature, I will stick with 1 for all initial scores.",
