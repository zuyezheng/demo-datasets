It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The language is legal and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact.",
