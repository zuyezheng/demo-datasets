    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining principles for federal infrastructure investment. The primary goal is to convey a sense of responsibility, efficiency, and strategic planning. It aims to instill confidence in the government's approach to infrastructure. The order does not seem to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, it may evoke a mild sense of trust and confidence. Therefore, I will score the emotions accordingly.",
