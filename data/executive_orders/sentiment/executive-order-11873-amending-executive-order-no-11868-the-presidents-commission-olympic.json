    "critique": "The executive order is a formal amendment to a previous order, focusing on the composition of a commission. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform about a change in the commission's structure, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon review, I confirm that the order is purely informational and should not evoke any significant emotional response.",
