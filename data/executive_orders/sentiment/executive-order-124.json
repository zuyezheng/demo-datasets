    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of joy and perhaps a little surprise. The order discusses gifts and souvenirs for families, which evokes joy. The surprise element comes from the unexpected nature of receiving gifts from loved ones serving abroad. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of joy might be moderate, around 6, as it's a thoughtful gesture but not overly celebratory. The surprise might be lower, around 3, as it's a pleasant surprise rather than a shocking one.",
