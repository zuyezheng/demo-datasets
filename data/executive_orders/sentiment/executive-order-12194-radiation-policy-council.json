    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that establishes a council to coordinate federal radiation protection policy. The intended emotional response is likely to be one of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to address radiation protection. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy (feeling safe and secure), with a secondary emotion of surprise (that the government is taking action). There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
