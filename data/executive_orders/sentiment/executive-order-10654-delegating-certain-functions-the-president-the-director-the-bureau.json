    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order delegating authority related to watershed protection and flood prevention. It's a legal and administrative document, so it primarily aims to convey authority and direction, not emotions. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low, as the document does not express any of them explicitly. Considering it's a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions to indicate a minimal level of emotional expression.",
