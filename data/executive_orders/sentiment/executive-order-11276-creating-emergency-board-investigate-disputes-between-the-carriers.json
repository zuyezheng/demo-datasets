    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order issued by President Lyndon B. Johnson. It addresses a labor dispute between air carriers and their employees, invoking the Railway Labor Act to create an investigative board. The language is legalistic and procedural, lacking emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the initial assessment remains accurate due to the document's formal and unemotional nature.",
