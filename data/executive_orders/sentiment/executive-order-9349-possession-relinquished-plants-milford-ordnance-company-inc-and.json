    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that relinquishes possession of plants back to private companies. The order aims to convey a sense of resolution and efficiency in supporting the war effort. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or relief that the plants are being returned to private operation, suggesting a positive step in the war effort. Therefore, I will score joy as a 3 and all other emotions as 1.",
