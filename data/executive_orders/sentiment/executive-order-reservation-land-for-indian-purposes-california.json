    "critique": "The executive order is a formal declaration regarding land use. It aims to convey a sense of authority and decisiveness, not to evoke strong emotions. However, depending on one's perspective (e.g., Native Americans, settlers), it could elicit different emotional responses. Considering the likely intended audience (government officials, land surveyors), the primary goal is clear communication, not emotional manipulation. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon revision, I will slightly increase surprise as the order might catch some off guard.",
