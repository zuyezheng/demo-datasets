    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal for Indian reservation purposes. It's a legal document, so the primary emotions conveyed are neutral. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, one could argue there's a hint of potential joy for the Native American population who might benefit from this reservation, and perhaps a tinge of sadness for those who might have been looking to settle on that land. Given the formal nature, these emotions are very muted. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy and sadness to acknowledge the potential implications.",
