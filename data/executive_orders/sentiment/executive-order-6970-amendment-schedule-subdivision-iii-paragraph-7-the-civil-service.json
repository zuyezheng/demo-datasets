    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document related to civil service rules and public health service employees. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about amendments to civil-service rules, specifically concerning public health service employees. It mentions attendants in hospitals, quarantine stations, sanatoriums, rural sanitation work, plague-suppressive measures, and employees assigned to classified positions during treatment or convalescence. The language is formal and bureaucratic. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
