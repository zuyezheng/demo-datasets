    "critique": "The executive order is a dry, technical document that amends civil service rules. It is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions in the reader. The most likely emotion is surprise, as the reader may not expect such a mundane topic to be the subject of an executive order. However, even this is a stretch. The initial scores should be very low across the board. After revision, I will reduce the surprise score to 0.",
