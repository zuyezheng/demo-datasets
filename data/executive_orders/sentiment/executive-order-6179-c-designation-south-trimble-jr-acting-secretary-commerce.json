    "critique": "The executive order is a routine administrative action, so it should not evoke strong emotions. The order authorizes someone to perform the duties of the Secretary of Commerce in their absence. It is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low for all emotions. Upon review, the scores should remain low, as the order is purely procedural and does not contain any elements that would typically elicit strong emotional responses.",
