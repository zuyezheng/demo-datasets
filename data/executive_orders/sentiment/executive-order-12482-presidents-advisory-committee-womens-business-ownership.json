    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the President's Advisory Committee on Women's Business Ownership. It primarily deals with extending the committee's life and modifying its objectives. The language is formal and legalistic, with no strong emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering the formal nature of the document, a score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions initially. Upon review, these scores seem appropriate given the document's purpose and tone.",
