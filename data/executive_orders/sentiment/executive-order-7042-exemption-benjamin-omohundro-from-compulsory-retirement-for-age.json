While it doesn't explicitly evoke strong emotions, there might be a subtle sense of joy that a qualified individual is allowed to continue their service for the public good. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not the intention of the order. The order seems to convey a low level of joy and no other emotions.",
