    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining the responsibilities of different departments in relation to the Refugee Relief Act of 1953. It doesn't seem to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal appears to be to establish a clear and organized process for handling refugees. Therefore, the emotion scores should be relatively low across all categories.",
