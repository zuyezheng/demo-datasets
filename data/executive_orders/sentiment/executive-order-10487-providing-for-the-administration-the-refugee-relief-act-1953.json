    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the Refugee Relief Act of 1953. It primarily focuses on assigning responsibilities to different government departments and allocating funds. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming to establish clear procedures and authority. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content.",
