    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's commitment to supporting individuals with disabilities. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to convey a sense of responsibility and adherence to legal obligations. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
