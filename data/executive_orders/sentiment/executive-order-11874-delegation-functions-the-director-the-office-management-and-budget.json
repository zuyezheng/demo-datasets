It invokes legal sections and titles, and assigns the Director of the Office of Management and Budget the power to exercise authority vested in the President. There is no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering this is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions.",
