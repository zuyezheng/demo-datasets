There might be a hint of anger or disgust towards the perpetrators of the crime, but it's not explicitly stated. There's a slight element of surprise that such an exception is being made, but it's not the primary emotion. Joy is not present. Fear is a possible emotion that Mrs. Kearney and her children might be experiencing.The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
