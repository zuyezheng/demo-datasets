    "critique": "The executive order discusses employee furloughs during the fiscal year 1933 due to budget constraints. The order aims to avoid dismissals by implementing furloughs, prioritizing higher-salaried employees and distributing the furlough period uniformly. The order emphasizes restricting furloughs to only when absolutely necessary and exploring alternative solutions like employee and appropriation transfers. \n\nGiven the context, the intended emotions are likely to be a mix of sadness (due to potential loss of income), fear (of job insecurity), and perhaps a touch of surprise (at the measures being taken). There's no indication of joy or disgust. The order seems to aim for a controlled and measured response, so the intensities shouldn't be too high.\n\nInitial scores:\nSadness: 6\nFear: 5\nSurprise: 3\nJoy: 1\nDisgust: 1\n\nRevised scores:\nSadness: 7 (Slightly increased due to the direct impact on employees)\nFear: 6 (Slightly increased to reflect job insecurity)\nSurprise: 3 (Remains the same)\nJoy: 1 (Remains the same)\nDisgust: 1 (Remains the same)",
