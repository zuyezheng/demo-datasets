    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to clarify the relationship between the government, industry, and constitutional rights within the context of the National Industrial Recovery Act. The language is legal and precise, focusing on ensuring no party waives their constitutional rights by participating in Codes of Fair Competition. There is no explicit emotional appeal in the document. The primary goal is to provide legal clarity and assurance. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default of 1 due to the lack of emotional content.",
