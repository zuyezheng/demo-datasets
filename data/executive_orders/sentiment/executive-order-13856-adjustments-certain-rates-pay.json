    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding pay adjustments for various government employees and officials. It is a formal and legal document. The language is neutral and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Most people will not read it and those who do are unlikely to have a strong reaction. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
