    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document that primarily aims to convey information about amendments to a council's composition. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions in the reader. However, one could argue there's a very mild sense of reassurance or stability conveyed by the act of updating and maintaining governmental structures. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for reassurance (which I will represent with 'joy').",
