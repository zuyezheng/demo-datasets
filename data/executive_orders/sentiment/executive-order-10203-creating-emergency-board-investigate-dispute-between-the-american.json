    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and resolution rather than strong emotions. It addresses a dispute and establishes a board to investigate, suggesting a desire to resolve the issue peacefully and maintain essential transportation services. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. My initial scores are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the order does aim to inspire a bit of confidence and relief that the situation is being handled, so I will adjust the joy score slightly upward. The order also acknowledges a threat to essential services, so I will keep fear at 2.",
