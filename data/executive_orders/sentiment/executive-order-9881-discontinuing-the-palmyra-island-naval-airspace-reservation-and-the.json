    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that discontinues naval airspace reservation and naval defensive sea area. The order itself doesn't contain language that evokes strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform about a change in regulations, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily informational, there might be a very slight sense of relief or satisfaction for those directly affected by the change, but it's minimal. Therefore, joy can be slightly increased, but all other emotions should remain very low.",
