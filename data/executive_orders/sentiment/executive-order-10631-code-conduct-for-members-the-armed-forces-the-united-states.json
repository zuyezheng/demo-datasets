While not explicitly designed to evoke strong emotions, certain aspects implicitly touch upon feelings like fear (of capture), determination (to resist), and loyalty (to comrades and country). The initial scores reflect a conservative estimate of these underlying emotions, focusing on the document's primary purpose of outlining expected behavior and obligations.",
