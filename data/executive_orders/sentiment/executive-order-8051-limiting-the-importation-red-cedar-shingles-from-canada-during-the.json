    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the import of red cedar shingles from Canada. It references previous orders and trade agreements, and sets a limit for imports in the first half of 1939. The language is legal and administrative, with no strong emotional content. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon review, the initial scores accurately reflect the neutral tone of the document.",
