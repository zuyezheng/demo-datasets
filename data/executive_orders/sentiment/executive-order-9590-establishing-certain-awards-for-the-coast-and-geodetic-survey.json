    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing service ribbons for the Coast and Geodetic Survey. It is a factual and procedural document, so it does not convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a sense of joy or pride associated with recognizing service, but this is subtle. The order aims to honor service members, which could evoke positive feelings.I will score the emotions based on this understanding.",
