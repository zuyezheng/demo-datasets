The announcement of honor and success for the Army of the Potomac suggests joy and pride, while the acknowledgment of fallen soldiers introduces sadness. There's no explicit anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the text. The intensity of joy and sadness should reflect the significance of the victory and the losses.",
