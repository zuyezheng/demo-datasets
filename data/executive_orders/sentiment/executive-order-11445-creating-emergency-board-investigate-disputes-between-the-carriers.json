    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and resolution, rather than strong emotions. It addresses a potential disruption to essential transportation services and establishes a board to investigate and resolve the disputes. The desired emotions are likely a sense of relief and perhaps a touch of hope that the situation will be resolved. Therefore, I will score joy and surprise low, and sadness, fear, and disgust very low, as the document aims to prevent negative outcomes rather than evoke negative feelings.",
