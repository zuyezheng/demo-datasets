    "critique": "The executive order seems to convey a sense of seriousness and purpose, but it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is a legal document that withdraws land for military use. It is unlikely to make anyone feel intense joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The most likely emotion is perhaps a mild sense of surprise that such an order is being issued, but even that is unlikely to be strong.",
