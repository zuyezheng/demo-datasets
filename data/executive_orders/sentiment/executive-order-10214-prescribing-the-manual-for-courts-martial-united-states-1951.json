    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to establish a legal framework for military justice. Therefore, the primary emotion it seeks to convey is a sense of order and authority, not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a secondary goal might be to instill confidence in the fairness and impartiality of the military justice system. I will score surprise as 1, disgust as 1, fear as 1, sadness as 1, joy as 1. I will revise the scores to surprise as 1, disgust as 1, fear as 1, sadness as 1, joy as 1.",
