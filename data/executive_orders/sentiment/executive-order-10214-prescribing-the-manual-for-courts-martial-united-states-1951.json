    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of formality, authority, and legal precision. The President is enacting a manual for military courts, which is a serious and official matter. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and accuracy rather than emotional impact. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a 1 indicating minimal presence.",
