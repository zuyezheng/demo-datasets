    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the establishment of a naval reservation. It is primarily a legal and administrative document. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotions, if any, would be related to a sense of order, governance, and perhaps a mild sense of security or reassurance that the government is functioning. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions are scored as 1 initially.",
