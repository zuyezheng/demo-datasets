    "critique": "The document is an executive order transferring land to the Department of Interior for use as a wildlife refuge. The tone is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of accomplishment and purpose in preserving land for wildlife, which could evoke a mild sense of joy. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect the presence of joy and the absence of other emotions.",
