    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and order. It's about amending existing rules for aliens entering the US, focusing on temporary stays for sightseeing. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to provide clarity and structure to the process. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further consideration, while the order is primarily administrative, there might be a very slight sense of relief or satisfaction for those who benefit from the amended rules, so I'll adjust the joy score slightly upwards. There's also a tiny element of surprise that the rules are being amended, so I'll add a 1 for surprise.",
