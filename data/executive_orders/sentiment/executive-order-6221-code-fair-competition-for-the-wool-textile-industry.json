The order is about fair competition and cooperation, suggesting a desire to instill confidence and reduce uncertainty. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, but at a low level. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the changes, but it's minimal. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
