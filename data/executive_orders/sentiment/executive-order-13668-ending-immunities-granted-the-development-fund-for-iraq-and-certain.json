    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of relief and perhaps cautious optimism. The termination of prohibitions suggests progress and resolution, which could evoke joy. However, the repeated emphasis on not affecting the existing national emergency and immunities indicates a need to temper expectations and avoid excessive excitement. Therefore, joy should be moderate. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as the order builds upon previous ones and acknowledges changed circumstances.",
