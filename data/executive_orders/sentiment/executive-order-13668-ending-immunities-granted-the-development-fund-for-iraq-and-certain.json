    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of resolution and policy change regarding the Development Fund for Iraq. While not explicitly emotional, the termination of prohibitions suggests a positive shift. However, the language is very formal and legal, so the emotional impact on the public is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for surprise due to the policy change.",
