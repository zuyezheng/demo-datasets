    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal and reservation for the Tennessee Valley Authority. It uses legal and administrative language. There is no explicit emotional expression in the document. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Considering that the order might bring a little surprise to the public, I will give a score of 2. After a second thought, the document is purely administrative, so all scores should be 1.",
