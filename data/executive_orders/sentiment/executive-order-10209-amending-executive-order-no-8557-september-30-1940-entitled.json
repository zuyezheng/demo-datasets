    "critique": "The executive order is a very dry, technical document. It amends a previous order related to the payment of expenses incurred in connection with the death of certain civilian officers and employees of the United States. The order specifies what costs are allowable under section 2 of these regulations, including costs of embalming, cremation, necessary clothing, and casket. The total amount allowed for such preparation shall not exceed $150. There is nothing in this order that would evoke any strong emotions. Maybe a tiny bit of sadness that it deals with death, but it's so clinical that even that is a stretch. The order is unlikely to evoke joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
