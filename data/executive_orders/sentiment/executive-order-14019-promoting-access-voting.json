It focuses on expanding access to voter registration and combating misinformation. The overall tone is serious and determined, with an emphasis on fairness and equality. Therefore, sadness and anger are present due to the existing obstacles, but joy is also present due to the commitment to improve the situation. Surprise is not a major factor, and disgust is minimal. The intensity of each emotion is scored based on the document's content and context.",
