It acknowledges the city's historical significance and the hardships it has faced, particularly the devastating floods. The order seeks to inspire confidence in the government's commitment to supporting the city's future. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with a secondary emotion of sadness due to the city's past struggles. There might be a hint of surprise that such a town exists.",
