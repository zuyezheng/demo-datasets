    "critique": "The executive order is a very dry, technical document. It revokes the designation of Lancaster, Minnesota, as a customs port of entry. There is no reason for the audience to feel any particular emotion. The initial scores should all be 1, indicating a very low level of emotion. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order is not intended to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores should remain at 1 for all emotions.",
