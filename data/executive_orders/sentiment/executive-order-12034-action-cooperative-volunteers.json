    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of duty and procedural correctness rather than strong emotions. It's about providing opportunities for former volunteers, which might evoke a mild sense of joy or satisfaction in those affected, but it's not designed to elicit strong emotional responses. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy. Upon further reflection, the order is more about policy and procedure, so even the slight emphasis on joy should be reduced. The revised scores reflect this adjustment.",
