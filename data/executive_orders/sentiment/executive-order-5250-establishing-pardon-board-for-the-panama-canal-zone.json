    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that amends a previous order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order grants the Governor of the Panama Canal the power to grant pardons, paroles, and reprieves for offenses against the laws, orders, and regulations of the Canal Zone. This may evoke a slight sense of joy in those who believe in the importance of second chances, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
