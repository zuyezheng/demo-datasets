    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document related to civil service rules. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order addresses employment conditions in specific locations, so it doesn't seem designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal appears to be administrative clarity rather than emotional impact. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
