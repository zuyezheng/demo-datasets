    "critique": "The document is a formal revocation of an executive order related to public lands in Utah. It's a legal and administrative action, devoid of emotional language. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially, as there's no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Upon review, this assessment remains accurate as the document's nature is purely procedural and lacks any emotional cues.",
