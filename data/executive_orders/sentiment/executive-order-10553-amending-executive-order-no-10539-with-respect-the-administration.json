    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order regarding the Abaca Production Act of 1950. It's a legal and administrative document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The language is formal and technical, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After further consideration, since the document is related to production act, there might be a slight sense of surprise. The final scores are adjusted accordingly.",
