    "critique": "The document expresses concern and determination in response to a perceived threat. It aims to convey a sense of seriousness and resolve rather than specific emotions like joy, sadness, or surprise. The primary emotions are closer to anger (at the actions of the Zimbabwean government) and perhaps a touch of fear (regarding the threat to US foreign policy), but these are presented in a controlled, formal manner. Disgust might be present but is not explicitly stated. The scores reflect this interpretation, with anger and fear receiving moderate scores and other emotions receiving low scores.",
