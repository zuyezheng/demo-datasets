    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order extending the provisions of Title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotional content. A baseline of 1 is appropriate for most emotions. There might be a slight sense of joy that the act is extended, and a slight sense of relief that things will continue as they are, but these are very mild.",
