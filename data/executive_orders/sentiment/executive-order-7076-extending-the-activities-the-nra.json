    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and continuity, rather than strong emotions. A slight sense of relief (joy) that things are being extended might be present, but overall, the tone is neutral and formal. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy. After further consideration, I've reduced the joy score to reflect the document's overall neutral tone.",
