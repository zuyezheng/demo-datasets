    "critique": "The executive order is a very dry, factual statement about appointments to the Federal Alcohol Control Administration. There is no reason for the audience to feel any particular emotion. The initial scores should all be 1, indicating a very low level of emotion. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order is devoid of any emotional content, so the revised scores should remain the same.",
