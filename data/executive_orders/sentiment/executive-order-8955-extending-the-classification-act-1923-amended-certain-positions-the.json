    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage national defense. It extends the Classification Act and establishes a salary differential, suggesting a proactive approach to recruiting qualified personnel. The order does not seem to want to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion would be joy that the government is handling national defense.",
