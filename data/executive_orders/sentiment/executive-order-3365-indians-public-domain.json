    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending land restrictions for Native Americans. There is no explicit emotional language used. The context suggests a legal or administrative action. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions due to the lack of emotional content. Upon review, the initial scores accurately reflect the neutral tone and lack of emotional expression in the document.",
