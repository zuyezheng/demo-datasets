    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order, so it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The order amends a previous order to include representatives from additional agencies in the War Manpower Commission. The language is neutral and factual, with no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Since there is not enough information, I will assign a score of 1 to all the emotions.",
