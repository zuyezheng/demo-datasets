    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order regarding loans by the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. The document expresses a sense of purpose and determination to provide relief, but this is not a strong emotional signal. The revised scores will reflect the formal and unemotional nature of the document.",
