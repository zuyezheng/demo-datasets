    "critique": "The executive order is a dry, factual statement about extending the terms of employment for specific government employees. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of relief or satisfaction for the employees whose jobs are extended, but this would be very mild. Therefore, joy is scored at 1, and all other emotions are scored at 1 as well.",
