    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and determination to address a specific issue (synthetic opioids). There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the implicit concern about the opioid crisis suggests a low level of sadness and perhaps disgust related to the issue. The determination to act might also imply a low level of anger towards those contributing to the problem. Given the formal nature, the scores should be relatively low.",
