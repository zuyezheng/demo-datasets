    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the application of an act concerning national security to the Panama Canal and the Panama Railroad Company. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the mention of 'national security' and 'summary suspension of employment' might implicitly convey a sense of fear or concern, but it is very subtle. Therefore, a low score is appropriate for fear. Other emotions like joy, sadness, disgust, and surprise are not evident in the text. I will assign a score of 1 for these emotions.",
