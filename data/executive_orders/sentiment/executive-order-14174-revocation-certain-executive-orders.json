    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It revokes two previous executive orders related to COVID-19 safety protocols and vaccination requirements for federal contractors and employees. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the revocation of these orders might evoke different emotions in different people. Those who support the mandates might feel sadness or anger, while those who oppose them might feel joy or relief. Considering the document itself, the president is not explicitly conveying any emotion. Therefore, the initial scores should be low for all emotions. After further consideration, the document is intended to be neutral, so all scores should be 1.",
