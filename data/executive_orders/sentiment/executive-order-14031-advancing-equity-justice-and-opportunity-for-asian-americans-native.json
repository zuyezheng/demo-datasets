    "critique": "The executive order aims to address systemic barriers and promote equity for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities. It acknowledges past injustices and seeks to foster inclusion and belonging. The order also recognizes the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these communities. Therefore, the primary emotions the president wants to convey are joy (in the sense of hope and progress), sadness (acknowledging past and present disparities), and a sense of surprise (at the extent of the disparities and injustices).",
