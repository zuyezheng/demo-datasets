    "critique": "The document expresses sadness and fear due to the discrimination and violence faced by AA and NHPI communities. It also expresses joy and hope through the establishment of the President's Advisory Commission and the White House Initiative, which aim to advance equity, justice, and opportunity for these communities. Surprise is low as the order is building on existing policies. Disgust is present due to the description of anti-Asian bias, xenophobia, racism, and nativism.",
