    "critique": "The document expresses sadness due to the death of Henry Clay. The language used, such as \"tolling bells,\" \"painful bereavement,\" and \"all hearts are too sad,\" clearly indicates sadness. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is likely to be high, given the respect for Henry Clay. Therefore, sadness is scored at 8, and all other emotions are scored at 1.",
