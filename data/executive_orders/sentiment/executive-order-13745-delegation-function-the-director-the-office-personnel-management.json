    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It authorizes the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish an emergency leave transfer program. There is no strong indication of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being conveyed. The order is formal and legalistic in tone. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
