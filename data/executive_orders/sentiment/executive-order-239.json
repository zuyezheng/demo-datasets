    "critique": "The document is a special departmental rule regarding the employment of substitutes. It outlines the conditions under which substitutes can be employed or appointed to permanent positions. The language is formal and bureaucratic, with a focus on rules and procedures. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document seems intended to convey a sense of order and regulation rather than any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions are scored as 1 due to the lack of emotional content.",
