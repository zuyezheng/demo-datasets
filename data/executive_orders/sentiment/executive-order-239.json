It eliminates substitutes and establishes a process for appointments, suggesting a desire to instill confidence and reduce uncertainty. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, as people should be happy that the government is being run efficiently. There may also be a small amount of surprise, as people may not have expected this order.",
