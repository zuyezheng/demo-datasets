    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document describing land revocation. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores are all set to 1, indicating a neutral emotional response. After further consideration, I still believe the document is largely neutral, but there might be a slight sense of surprise or curiosity due to the nature of executive orders and land management. Therefore, I will adjust the surprise score to 2.",
