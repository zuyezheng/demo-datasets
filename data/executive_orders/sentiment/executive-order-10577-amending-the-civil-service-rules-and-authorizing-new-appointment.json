    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding civil service rules. It is primarily informational and procedural, with no overt emotional expression. The president is conveying a sense of authority and order, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, intended to be precise and unambiguous. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
