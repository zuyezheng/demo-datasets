    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action, reallocating land for specific purposes. It revokes a previous order and designates land for aviation purposes. There is no language or content that explicitly evokes strong emotions. However, one could argue there might be a slight sense of surprise (1) that such an order is being issued, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, I will set all emotions to 1, except surprise which I will set to 2.",
