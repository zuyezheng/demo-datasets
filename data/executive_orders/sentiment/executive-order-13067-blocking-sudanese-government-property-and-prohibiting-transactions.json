It highlights the threat to national security and human rights violations. Therefore, the primary emotions to be conveyed are fear and disgust, with a touch of sadness regarding the human rights situation. There might be a slight element of surprise at the severity of the situation, but it's not the main focus. The order does not aim to evoke joy.",
