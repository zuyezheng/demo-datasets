There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. However, a subtle sense of concern or seriousness might be present due to the potential disruption of essential transportation services. The order does not want the audience to feel joy, disgust, or surprise. The order wants the audience to feel a small amount of sadness and fear. The order does not want the audience to feel anger.",
