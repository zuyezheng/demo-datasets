    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Armed Forces Reserve Medal. It is primarily informational and procedural, lacking strong emotional content. The President is not explicitly trying to convey any particular emotion. However, a sense of pride and respect for the armed forces could be inferred. Initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions due to the lack of explicit emotional expression. Revised scores consider a slight sense of joy and pride, increasing the joy score to 2.",
