    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal delegation of power related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue it aims to inspire a sense of confidence (joy) in the government's actions and perhaps a mild sense of reassurance (surprise) that the government is taking action to address industrial recovery. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
