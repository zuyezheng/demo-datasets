    "critique": "The document expresses a serious tone regarding a labor dispute and its potential impact on the war effort. The president invokes legal authority to ensure the continued operation of a plant. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a sense of urgency and determination to maintain war production can be inferred. The scores reflect the subtle presence of these emotions, with slightly higher scores for fear (of production delays) and determination (a muted form of joy/resolve).",
