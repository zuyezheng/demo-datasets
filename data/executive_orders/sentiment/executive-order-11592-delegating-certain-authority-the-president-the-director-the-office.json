    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine delegation of authority. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order transfers responsibility for granting approvals related to the River and Harbor Act and the Flood Control Act from the President to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. This is a procedural matter and not designed to elicit a strong emotional response. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
