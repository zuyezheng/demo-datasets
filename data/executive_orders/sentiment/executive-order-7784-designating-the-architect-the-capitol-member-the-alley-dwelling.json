It primarily concerns administrative changes, specifically the replacement of one member with another. There is no language or context suggesting any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, as the public is unlikely to feel any strong sentiment based on this document. Since there is not enough information provided, I will use a score of 1 for all emotions.",
