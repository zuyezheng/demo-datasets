    "critique": "The document is a formal order to abolish Souris, North Dakota, as a port of entry. The language is formal and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the act of abolishing a port of entry might convey a sense of sadness or disappointment to those affected, but this is not explicitly stated. Given the formal nature and lack of emotional cues, the scores should be low across all emotions. Considering the context, there might be a slight sense of sadness due to the abolishment, but it's minimal.",
