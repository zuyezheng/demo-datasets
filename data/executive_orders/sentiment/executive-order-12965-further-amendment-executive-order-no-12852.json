    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It extends the President's Council on Sustainable Development. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or hope that the extension of the council will lead to positive outcomes, but this is very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
