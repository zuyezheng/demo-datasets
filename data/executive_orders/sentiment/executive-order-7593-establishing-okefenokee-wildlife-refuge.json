The primary purpose is to set aside land for the conservation of migratory birds and other wildlife. The language is legal and administrative, focusing on precise land descriptions. There is a subtle sense of joy and hope associated with the preservation of nature, but it is not explicitly stated. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
