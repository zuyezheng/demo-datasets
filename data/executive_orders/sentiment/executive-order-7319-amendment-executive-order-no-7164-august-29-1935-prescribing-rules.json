    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to instill a sense of hope and relief, particularly for students who need financial assistance to continue their education. The order outlines specific amounts of aid for different levels of students, suggesting a structured and organized approach to providing support. While it may not evoke intense joy, it should inspire a sense of gratitude and security among the beneficiaries. There may be a little surprise that the president is taking these actions. There is no sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
