    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the extension of service for John L. Summers. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the implied emotions are that the president believes this extension serves the public interest. Therefore, there is a slight sense of Joy. The absence of negative implications suggests low scores for sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise.",
