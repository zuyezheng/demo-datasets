    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and stability. The order emphasizes the importance of the Government-University partnership and seeks to strengthen it. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with a secondary emphasis on trust and confidence. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not the primary goal, but a mild sense of reassurance that the government is taking action might evoke a small amount of surprise.",
