    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a technical amendment related to compensation for military personnel involved in thermal stress experiments. It's unlikely the president intends to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to provide a clear definition for 'duty as human test subject' to ensure proper compensation. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low.",
