    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the expenditure of emergency funds. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the order implies a sense of responsibility and control over government spending. It is difficult to gauge the emotions the president is trying to convey to the public. Therefore, I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially. After further consideration, the order could be interpreted as conveying a sense of control and perhaps a slight sense of relief or satisfaction that measures are being taken to manage government finances during a time of emergency (likely the Great Depression). However, these emotions are very subtle and not explicitly stated. Therefore, I will adjust the scores slightly to reflect this, but keeping them low.",
