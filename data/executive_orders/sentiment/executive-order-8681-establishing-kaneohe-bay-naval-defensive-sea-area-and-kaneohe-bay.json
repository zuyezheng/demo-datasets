    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to inspire a sense of security and seriousness, with a hint of concern for national defense. It's unlikely to evoke joy or surprise. The order might cause a little fear and disgust in those who don't want the order to be in place, and a little sadness that people are not allowed in the area. The primary emotion is fear, followed by sadness and disgust.",
