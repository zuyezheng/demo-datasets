It is a legal and administrative document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary purpose is to establish a process for handling requests related to semiconductor chip protection. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, with a slight emphasis on surprise due to the nature of an executive order being issued.",
