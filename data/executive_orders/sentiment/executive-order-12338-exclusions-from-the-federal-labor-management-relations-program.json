The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. The order focuses on specific agencies and subdivisions, listing them in a factual manner. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional content.",
