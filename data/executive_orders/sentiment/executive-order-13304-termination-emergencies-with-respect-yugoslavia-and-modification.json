    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document, and its primary goal is to communicate policy changes and directives clearly and unambiguously. It is unlikely that the president intends to evoke strong emotions in the audience. However, there might be a subtle intention to convey a sense of reassurance and decisiveness. The termination of old emergencies could bring a sense of relief, while the continuation of measures against certain actions might instill a sense of security. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and very low scores to the other emotions.",
