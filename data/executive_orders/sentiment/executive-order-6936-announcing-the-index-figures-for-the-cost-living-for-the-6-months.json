    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal announcement regarding cost of living index figures and their impact on compensation for officers and employees. The language is very technical and factual, with no obvious attempt to evoke any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1. After further consideration, it is unlikely that the document is intended to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
