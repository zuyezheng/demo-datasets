    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual document. The president likely wants the audience to feel no strong emotions, but perhaps a mild sense of confidence and assurance that the Navy is being organized effectively. Therefore, I will score joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all as 1 initially. After further consideration, since this is a military document, perhaps a slight sense of confidence is intended. I will revise joy to 2 to reflect this.",
