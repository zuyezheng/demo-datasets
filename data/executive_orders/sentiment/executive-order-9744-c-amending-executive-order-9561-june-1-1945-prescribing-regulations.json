    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding allowances for quarters and subsistence to enlisted men. It extends a previous order. There is no explicit emotional content. The expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal, as it's a technical adjustment. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After further consideration, the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. The initial low scores are appropriate and do not need revision.",
