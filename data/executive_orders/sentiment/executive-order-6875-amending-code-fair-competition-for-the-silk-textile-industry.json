    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document with the purpose of amending provisions of the Code of Fair Competition for the Silk Textile Industry. The order is meant to convey a sense of authority, compliance, and policy implementation. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate the approval of the amendment and its compliance with the National Industrial Recovery Act. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
