    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of authority and determination to protect wildlife. There's a hint of concern for the environment, but it's not strongly emphasized. The emotions of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not explicitly present. The language is formal and legalistic, which doesn't lend itself to strong emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores will be relatively low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on concern/fear due to the warnings against harming the refuge.",
