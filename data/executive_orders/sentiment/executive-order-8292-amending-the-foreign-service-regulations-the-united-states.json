    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that outlines the duties of Foreign Service officers in connection with extradition proceedings, legal services, and notarial services. It also cancels some sections of regulations and revokes a previous executive order. The document is formal and procedural, and it does not aim to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
