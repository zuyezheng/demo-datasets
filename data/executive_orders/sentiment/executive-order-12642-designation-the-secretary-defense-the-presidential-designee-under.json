    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action, delegating authority related to absentee voting. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is formal and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily administrative, there might be a very slight sense of reassurance or confidence that the absentee voting process is being properly managed, which could translate to a minimal level of joy or surprise. However, this is a very subtle effect.",
