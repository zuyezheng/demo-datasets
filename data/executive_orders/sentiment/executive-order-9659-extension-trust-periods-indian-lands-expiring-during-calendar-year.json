    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document and not intended to evoke any strong emotions. The order extends trust periods for Indian lands. It's unlikely to make people feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be very low for all emotions. After further consideration, the order is a dry legal document, so the scores should remain very low.",
