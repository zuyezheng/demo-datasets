    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a very formal and legal document. The president is excusing Harry C. Dorsey from retirement. This does not seem to evoke strong emotions. Maybe a tiny bit of joy and surprise that Harry gets to keep his job, but overall it should be very low. The initial scores reflect this. After further consideration, the scores seem appropriate for the context.",
