    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document allocating funds. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue that it could bring a sense of relief (joy) to those who need the funds, and perhaps a bit of surprise that such a large sum is being allocated. Fear, disgust, and sadness are unlikely to be conveyed. The initial scores reflect this, with a small amount of joy and surprise. After further consideration, the emotional impact is likely minimal, so the revised scores are even lower.",
