The primary goal is to inform the audience of a change in authority regarding land conveyance to the State of Hawaii. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, since this is a formal announcement, I will reduce all scores to 0, except surprise which I will keep at 1, as some readers might be mildly surprised by the update.",
