    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the termination of a national emergency with respect to Nicaragua. The language is legal and procedural. There is a sense of relief and satisfaction that the democratic election has ended the threat, but this is expressed in a very formal and understated way. Therefore, joy is low. Sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not relevant in this context.",
