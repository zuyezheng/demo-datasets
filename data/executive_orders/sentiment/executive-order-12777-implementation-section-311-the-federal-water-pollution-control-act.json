    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that delegates authority and responsibilities related to oil pollution prevention and response. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. However, for those directly involved in environmental protection and the oil industry, it might inspire a sense of reassurance (joy) that there is a clear framework for dealing with oil spills, or perhaps concern (fear) about the potential liabilities and responsibilities. Disgust and sadness are unlikely to be relevant. Surprise is possible if there are unexpected changes in the delegation of authority, but overall, the document is more about clarity and order than surprise.",
