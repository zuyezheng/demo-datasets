    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a mundane administrative document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be surprise, due to the specific nature of the request, but it would be very mild. The initial scores are all set to 1, indicating a very low level of emotional response. After further consideration, I believe the surprise score should be slightly higher, as the specificity of the request might catch some readers off guard.",
