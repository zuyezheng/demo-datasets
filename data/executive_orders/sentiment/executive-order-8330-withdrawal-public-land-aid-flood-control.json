    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal for flood control in Alaska. It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of reassurance (joy) that the government is taking action to protect against floods, but it's very subtle. There's no strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
