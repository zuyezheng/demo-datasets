The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document focuses on procedural changes and agreements between departments. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional content.",
