    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability. It establishes a board and outlines its functions in a clear, procedural manner. There's no apparent intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on structure and process rather than emotional appeal. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
