    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Management Advisory Board. It outlines the board's mission, membership, administration, and termination. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the creation of such a board could be interpreted as conveying a sense of optimism and determination to improve government management and efficiency. It could also be interpreted as conveying a sense of concern about the current state of government management, but this is less explicit. Given the lack of explicit emotional language, the scores should be low across the board. The highest score should be for joy, reflecting the potential optimism associated with the board's creation. All other scores should be 1, reflecting the lack of evidence for those emotions.",
