    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of urgency and determination to address the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. While there's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, the context implies a concern for the economic well-being of the nation. The President is attempting to portray a sense of leadership and action to reassure the public and stimulate economic recovery. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on policy and directives rather than emotional appeals. Therefore, the scores should reflect a low level of emotional intensity across all categories.",
