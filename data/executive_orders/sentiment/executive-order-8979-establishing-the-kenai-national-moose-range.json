    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order establishing the Kenai National Moose Range in Alaska. The primary purpose is to protect the natural breeding and feeding range of the giant Kenai moose. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on the specific details of the land being reserved and the conditions of the reservation. There is a sense of purpose and determination in protecting the wildlife and its habitat, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with slightly elevated scores for joy and surprise due to the positive action of protecting wildlife, but low scores for other emotions.",
