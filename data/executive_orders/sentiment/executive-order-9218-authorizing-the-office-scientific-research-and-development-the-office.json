The order is related to war, so it may cause some fear and sadness, but the primary goal is to inform and authorize. The order itself doesn't contain language that would evoke strong emotions. The initial scores reflect a minimal amount of fear and sadness, with the rest being zero. The revised scores are the same, as the initial assessment seems appropriate.",
