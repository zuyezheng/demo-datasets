    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding labor disputes and the creation of a Board of Inquiry. The language is legal and procedural, with the president invoking their authority to address a potential strike. There is a sense of concern about the potential impact of the strike on the maritime industry and national health and safety. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed are concern and a sense of urgency, but not to a high degree. There's a hint of fear regarding the potential consequences of the strike, but it's not overwhelming. There's no indication of joy, disgust, or surprise.",
