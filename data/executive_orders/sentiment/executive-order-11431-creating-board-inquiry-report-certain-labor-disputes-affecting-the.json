    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of urgency and importance, but not necessarily to evoke strong emotions. It's more about stating facts and establishing a board of inquiry. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values. After further consideration, I realized that the order is trying to prevent a strike that would 'imperil the national health and safety'. This suggests a degree of fear and concern that should be reflected in the revised scores.",
