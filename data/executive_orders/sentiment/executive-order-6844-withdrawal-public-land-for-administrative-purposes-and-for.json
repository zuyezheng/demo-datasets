    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual statement about land withdrawal. There's no obvious attempt to evoke emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is formal and legalistic in tone, focusing on the specific details of the land being withdrawn and the legal basis for the action. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
