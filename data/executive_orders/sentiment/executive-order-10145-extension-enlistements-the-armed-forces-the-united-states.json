    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of seriousness and resolve, but not necessarily strong emotions. The extension of enlistments might cause some sadness for those affected, and perhaps a little fear about the implications of the order. There might be a little surprise at the action, but overall, the order is intended to be perceived as a necessary action. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are slightly adjusted to better reflect the intended emotions.",
