    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the establishment of a board to investigate disputes. It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, intended to convey a sense of order and authority rather than emotional appeal. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be very low. Upon further reflection, while the primary goal isn't to evoke emotion, there might be a subtle element of reassurance or relief for those concerned about potential disruptions to transportation services. This could translate to a very mild sense of hope or reduced fear. However, this is a secondary effect, and the scores should still be minimal.",
