    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document about land withdrawal for the National Guard. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low. Upon further reflection, there might be a very slight sense of surprise due to the formal and somewhat unexpected nature of the document's content, but it would be minimal.",
