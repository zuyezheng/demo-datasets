    "critique": "The document is a presidential order adding land to the Upper Mississippi River Wildlife and Fish Refuge. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of official action and conservation. There's a hint of joy in preserving wildlife, but it's not overt. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this.",
