Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low, reflecting the neutral tone of the document. Considering that there might be a slight sense of satisfaction or approval in completing this administrative task, a minimal score is assigned to joy. All other emotions are scored as 1, indicating a lack of discernible emotional content.",
