    "critique": "The document is a formal letter from the President to the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the allocation of funds for public purposes in Puerto Rico. The language is formal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is directing the allocation of funds, but the tone is neutral and objective. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with all emotions scored at 1. After reflection, I confirm that the document does not convey any strong emotion, and the scores should remain at 1.",
