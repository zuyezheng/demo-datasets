    "critique": "The document expresses concern and determination regarding the situation in northern Ethiopia. It highlights the violence, human rights abuses, and humanitarian crisis, indicating sadness and disgust. The declaration of a national emergency suggests a sense of urgency and perhaps fear regarding the potential threat to national security. However, the document also conveys a sense of resolve and determination to address the crisis through sanctions and support for humanitarian efforts. There is little to no explicit expression of joy or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:\n\nJoy: 1\nSadness: 7\nFear: 6\nDisgust: 7\nSurprise: 2",
