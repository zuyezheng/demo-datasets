    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President regarding the withdrawal of public lands for use as a practice bombing and gunnery range. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, given the context of the time (1941) and the mention of a 'national emergency,' a sense of underlying concern and perhaps a need for preparedness can be inferred. However, since the document itself does not explicitly convey any emotion, I will assign low scores across the board. Considering the context of a national emergency, I will give a slightly higher score to fear.",
