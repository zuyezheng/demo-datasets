    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of urgency and resolve in addressing a national emergency. It invokes legal authorities and establishes a clear directive regarding working hours and compensation for laborers and mechanics in the Department of Defense. While it doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions, it subtly intends to instill a sense of confidence and security by demonstrating decisive action during a time of crisis. The order does not want the audience to feel joy, disgust, or sadness. The order wants the audience to feel slight fear and surprise.",
