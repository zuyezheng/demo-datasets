    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a commitment to community-based alternatives for individuals with disabilities. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong expression of any particular emotion. A baseline of 1 is appropriate for emotions that are not explicitly conveyed. The document conveys a sense of purpose and determination, which could be interpreted as a mild form of joy or hope. However, this is very subtle. The document does not express sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
