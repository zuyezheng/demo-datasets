It expresses concern about threats to national security posed by certain countries' advancements in technology. The language is formal and legalistic. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed is fear, with a secondary element of concern or seriousness. There is no indication of joy. Sadness is not a primary emotion, but there is a sense of gravity. Disgust is not explicitly conveyed, but there is an underlying sense of disapproval. Surprise is not a prominent emotion.",
