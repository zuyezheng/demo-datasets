    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that waives certain trade restrictions with the Soviet Union. The language is legal and procedural, and the tone is neutral. The order does not contain any language that would evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. The initial scores are all 1, indicating a very low level of emotional conveyance. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order does not convey any significant emotions. Therefore, the revised scores will remain the same.",
