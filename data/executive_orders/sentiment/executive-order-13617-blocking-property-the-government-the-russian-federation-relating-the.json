It expresses concern about nuclear proliferation and outlines measures to ensure the implementation of agreements with Russia regarding fissile material. The primary emotion conveyed is fear due to the threat to national security. There might be a hint of disgust towards nuclear proliferation. There is no indication of joy or surprise. Sadness might be present due to the situation, but it is not the primary emotion. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
