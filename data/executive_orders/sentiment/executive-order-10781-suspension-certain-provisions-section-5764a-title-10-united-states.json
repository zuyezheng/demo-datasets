    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding promotion zones for Navy officers. It's a legal and administrative document, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The language is formal and specific, focusing on legal and procedural aspects. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1 initially. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains clear. The document's purpose is purely administrative, with no attempt to sway public sentiment emotionally.",
