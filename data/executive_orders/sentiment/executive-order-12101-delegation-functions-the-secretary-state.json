    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of authority from the President to the Secretary of State regarding diplomatic privileges and immunities. It cites the relevant laws and sections. There is no strong emotional content. A baseline of 1 is appropriate for most emotions, as the document is purely administrative in nature. There's a very slight sense of importance or seriousness, so I will adjust sadness to 2.",
