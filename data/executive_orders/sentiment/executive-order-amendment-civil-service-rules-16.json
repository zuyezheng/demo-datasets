The primary goal appears to be clarity and adherence to existing laws. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I don't think any of these emotions are really intended to be conveyed, so I will revise all scores to 0.",
