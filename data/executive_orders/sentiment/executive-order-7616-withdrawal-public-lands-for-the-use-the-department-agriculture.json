The order is about land use and development, so it might bring a slight sense of joy to those who benefit from the Thunder Basin Project. It might bring a slight sense of sadness to those whose prior entries, selections, rights, appropriations, or claims are cancelled, terminated, or released. It might bring a slight sense of surprise to those who are affected by the order.",
