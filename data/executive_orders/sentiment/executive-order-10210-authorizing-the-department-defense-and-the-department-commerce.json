    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order detailing contract regulations for the Department of Defense and the Department of Commerce. It is primarily legal and administrative in nature. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such an order exists, but even that is unlikely to be strong. Most emotions are not applicable.",
