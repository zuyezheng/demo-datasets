    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It uses formal language and aims to convey a sense of authority and impartiality. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, might be a mild sense of concern or urgency due to the potential disruption of transportation services, but this is very subtle. Therefore, most emotions should be scored very low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for concern/surprise.",
