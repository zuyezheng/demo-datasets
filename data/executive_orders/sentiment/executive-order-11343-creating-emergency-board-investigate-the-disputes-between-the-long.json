    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of serious concern and decisive action. It highlights a threat to essential transportation services due to unresolved labor disputes. The order seeks to convey a sense of urgency and importance, but not necessarily to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to inform and reassure the public that the situation is being addressed responsibly and effectively. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values. Upon further consideration, the order does aim to reduce fear and surprise by addressing the railway dispute, so I will adjust those scores slightly upward.",
