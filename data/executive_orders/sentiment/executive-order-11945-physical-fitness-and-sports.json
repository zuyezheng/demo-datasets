    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to amend a previous order related to physical fitness and sports. The language is formal and objective, with no explicit emotional expression. However, one could argue there's a subtle sense of joy or optimism implied in promoting health and fitness, and perhaps a slight sense of concern (sadness) about the costs of physical inactivity. Surprise, fear, disgust and anger are not present.",
