    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land use in New Mexico. It revokes a previous order and temporarily withdraws certain lands for soil-erosion control and other land utilization activities. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be 1, indicating a lack of conveyed emotion.",
