    "critique": "The executive order is a set of regulations regarding the uniforms of commissioned officers of the Public Health Service. It is a very formal and technical document. The primary goal is to establish clear guidelines and standards for uniforms. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is intended to be informative and directive, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The most relevant emotion might be a very mild sense of order or perhaps slight interest for those directly affected, but these would be minimal.I will set all initial scores to 1.",
