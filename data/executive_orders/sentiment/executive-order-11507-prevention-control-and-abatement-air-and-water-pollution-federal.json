It aims to convey a sense of responsibility, commitment, and seriousness towards protecting air and water resources. Therefore, the primary emotions it should evoke are joy (related to environmental protection) and perhaps a mild sense of surprise (due to the comprehensive nature of the order). There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
