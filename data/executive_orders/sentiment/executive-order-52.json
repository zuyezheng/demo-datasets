    "critique": "The executive order is a simple statement about reinstating Mrs. Harrigan to her former position. It doesn't seem designed to evoke any strong emotions. There might be a tiny bit of joy for Mrs. Harrigan, but for the general public, it's unlikely to cause any significant emotional response. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain very low.",
