    "critique": "The document is a formal statement about reinstating Mrs. Frank L. Harrigan to her previous position. The language is neutral and bureaucratic, without any explicit emotional cues. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially, as there is not enough information to suggest any specific sentiment. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains the primary factor. The statement is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, the revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
