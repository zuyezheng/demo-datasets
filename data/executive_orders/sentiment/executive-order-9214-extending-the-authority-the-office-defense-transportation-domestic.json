    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement expanding the authority of the Office of Defense Transportation. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is informational and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be very low for all emotions. After further consideration, the scores should remain very low, as the document's primary purpose is administrative and legal, not emotional.",
