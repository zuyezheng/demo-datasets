The order is about directing official communications to specific departments. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I don't think any emotion is particularly intended, so I will revise all scores to 1.",
