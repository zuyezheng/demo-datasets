    "critique": "The document is a formal directive regarding the provision of information by department heads to the Senate or House of Representatives. The language is formal and neutral, with no strong emotional indicators. The only possible emotion conveyed might be a slight sense of caution or concern for the public interest, but this is very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for fear due to the mention of public interest.",
