    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a directive about how a department head should respond to requests for information from the Senate or House of Representatives. It prioritizes compliance but allows for referral to the President if the department head believes it's not in the public interest. The order seems formal and bureaucratic in nature. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, it could evoke a tiny bit of surprise that such an order was deemed necessary.",
