    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land allocation. It revokes a previous order that had set aside land for the Sioux Indian Reservation and restores that land to the public domain. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the action of taking land away from a reservation could be interpreted as causing sadness or fear for the affected population, but this is not explicitly stated. Given the lack of explicit emotional content, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After a second thought, the document itself doesn't convey any emotion, so all scores should be 1.",
