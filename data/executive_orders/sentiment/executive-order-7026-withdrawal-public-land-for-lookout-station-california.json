    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document about land management. It revokes a previous order and withdraws a tract of land for use as a lookout station. The language is very formal and legalistic. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The most likely emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such orders are still being issued, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, I will score all emotions very low initially.",
