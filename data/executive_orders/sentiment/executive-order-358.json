    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the death of ex-President Franklin Pierce and instructions for honoring him. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death, but it is presented in a respectful and formal manner. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is moderate, as it is a formal announcement rather than a personal expression of grief.The initial scores reflect the emotions conveyed in the document. The revised scores are based on the critique of the initial scores.",
