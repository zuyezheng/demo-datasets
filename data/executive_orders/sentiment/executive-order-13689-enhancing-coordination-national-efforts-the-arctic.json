    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of responsibility, concern, and proactive action regarding the Arctic region. It highlights the strategic, ecological, cultural, and economic value of the Arctic, the impact of climate change, and the need for coordinated national efforts. The order seeks to instill a sense of urgency and importance, but also confidence in the government's ability to address the challenges. Therefore, the primary emotions to be conveyed are concern (leading to sadness), responsibility (leading to joy that action is being taken), and perhaps a touch of surprise at the extent of the changes in the Arctic. Fear and disgust are not primary emotions the order tries to convey.",
