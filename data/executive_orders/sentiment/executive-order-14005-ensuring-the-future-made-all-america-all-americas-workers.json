    "critique": "The executive order focuses on promoting the use of American-made goods and services in government procurement. The primary emotion the president likely wants to convey is joy, stemming from the idea of supporting American businesses and workers. There might be a secondary element of surprise, as the order revokes previous executive orders and introduces new measures. There isn't a strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
