    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding naturalization for aliens and non-citizens who served in the Armed Forces in the Grenada campaign. It specifies the period and locations of qualifying active-duty service. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering the formal nature, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions to indicate a minimal level of each emotion being conveyed through the formal tone and the subject matter (military service, naturalization).",
