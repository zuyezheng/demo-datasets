    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order outlining the duties of Foreign Service officers in protecting and promoting American economic interests. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, there is an implicit sense of purpose and determination to safeguard and advance American interests. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive connotation of promoting American interests.",
