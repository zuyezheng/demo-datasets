    "critique": "The executive order focuses on addressing violence against Native Americans and missing or murdered indigenous people. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are sadness and concern about the issue, coupled with a sense of hope and determination to improve the situation. There might also be an element of surprise at the extent of the problem and the lack of sufficient action in the past. Disgust at the violence and injustice is also possible. Joy is not an emotion that the president would want to convey in this context.",
