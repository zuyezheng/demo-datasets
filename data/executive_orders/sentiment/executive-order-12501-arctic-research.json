It outlines the structure, membership, functions, and responsibilities of these entities. The language is formal and legalistic, with no overt expression of emotion. The purpose is to establish a framework for Arctic research policy, not to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
