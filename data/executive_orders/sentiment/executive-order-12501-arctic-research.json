    "critique": "The executive order aims to establish committees and policies for Arctic research. It is a formal document outlining the structure, membership, and functions of these entities. The intended emotional response is likely to be one of confidence in the government's commitment to Arctic research and perhaps a sense of reassurance that the research will be well-coordinated and beneficial. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a mild sense of reassurance or confidence might be intended.",
