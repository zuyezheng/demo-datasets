    "critique": "The executive order is a wartime order focused on security. The primary emotion conveyed should be fear, due to the restrictions and potential for exclusion and detention. There might also be some disgust towards the enemy and a desire to prevent sabotage. Surprise is not really relevant here, nor is joy. Sadness might be a very minor component due to the context of war, but it's not a primary emotion the order tries to evoke.",
