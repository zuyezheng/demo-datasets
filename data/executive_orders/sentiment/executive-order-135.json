    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of calm and control. It emphasizes preserving peace and protecting life and property, suggesting a desire to reduce fear and promote a sense of security. The order also instructs General Otis to be conciliatory, indicating an intention to avoid anger and conflict. There might be a hint of sadness related to the situation requiring troop deployment, but it's not the primary emotion. Surprise is unlikely to be a significant factor.",
