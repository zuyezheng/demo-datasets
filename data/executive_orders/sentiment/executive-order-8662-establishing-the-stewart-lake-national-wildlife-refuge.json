    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of respect for nature and perhaps a subtle sense of reassurance that the government is taking action to protect wildlife. There might be a hint of joy associated with the preservation of nature, but it's not a dominant emotion. There isn't a strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as executive orders are generally expected announcements. The primary emotion is a mild sense of joy and respect.",
