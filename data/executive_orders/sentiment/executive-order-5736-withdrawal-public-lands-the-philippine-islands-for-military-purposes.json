    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual declaration about land allocation for military purposes. There's no indication of an attempt to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily informational, the act of reserving land for military purposes might subtly aim to inspire a sense of security or confidence (a mild form of joy/reassurance) and perhaps a very slight sense of surprise that such an order is being issued. However, these are very subtle, so the scores should remain low.",
