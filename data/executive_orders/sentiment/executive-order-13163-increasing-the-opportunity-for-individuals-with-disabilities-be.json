    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a commitment to increasing employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities within the Federal Government. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of optimism and determination to address the issue of underemployment of qualified individuals with disabilities. However, the primary goal is to enact a policy change, not to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low, reflecting the formal and objective nature of the document.",
