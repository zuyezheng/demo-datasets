    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document regarding the transfer of block mica for military production during wartime. The primary emotion it aims to convey is a sense of urgency and resolve in addressing a shortage critical to the war effort. While not explicitly emotional, the context implies a need to inspire confidence and assurance that the government is taking necessary actions. Therefore, I would expect a low score for fear and surprise, and a slightly higher score for joy that the war effort is being addressed. Disgust and sadness are not relevant.",
