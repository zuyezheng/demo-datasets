The primary emotion conveyed should be a sense of optimism and hope for a healthier future, with a secondary emotion of trust in the government's ability to address these issues. There is no indication of negative emotions such as sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a relevant emotion in this context.",
