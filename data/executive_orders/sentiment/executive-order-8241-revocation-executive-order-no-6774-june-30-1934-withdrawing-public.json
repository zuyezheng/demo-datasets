    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land resurvey in Washington. It revokes a previous order and specifies the effective date based on the filing of the resurvey plat. There is no explicit emotional language or sentiment expressed in the document. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, as the public is unlikely to feel any strong emotion based on this document alone. I will give a score of 1 for each emotion.",
