    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding sanctions on the importation of jadeite and rubies from Burma. It invokes legal authorities and outlines specific prohibitions and exceptions. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the order implies a sense of disapproval or concern regarding the situation in Burma, which could be interpreted as a form of disgust or perhaps a desire to prevent further negative actions. However, given the formal and legal nature of the document, the emotional impact on the American public is likely to be minimal. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After revision, I will adjust the disgust score slightly higher to reflect the underlying disapproval implied by the sanctions.",
