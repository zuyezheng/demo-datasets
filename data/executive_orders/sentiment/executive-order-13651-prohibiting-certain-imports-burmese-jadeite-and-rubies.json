    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that aims to prohibit the importation of jadeite and rubies from Burma. The order invokes legal authorities and outlines specific actions and definitions. The intended audience is likely government officials, businesses involved in importing these goods, and those monitoring international trade. The document does not explicitly aim to evoke emotions. However, one could argue that it aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing a national emergency or policy objective. It could also aim to convey a sense of confidence and authority. I will score it accordingly.",
