    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It expresses concern about potential disruption to interstate commerce and establishes a board to investigate the dispute. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of urgency and importance, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on concern or seriousness which might translate to a low level of sadness or fear.",
