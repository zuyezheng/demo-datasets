It also intends to inspire a sense of awe and wonder, bordering on surprise, at the ambitious nature of space exploration. There's a subtle undercurrent of sadness due to the reference to John F. Kennedy's memory, but it's not the primary emotion. There is no indication of fear, disgust, or anger.",
