    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about revoking an executive order related to the Lake Ontario Claims Tribunal. It cites the legal basis for the action and states that the tribunal has completed its functions. The language is formal and factual, without any explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Since there is not enough information, a score of 1 will be given to all the emotions.",
