    "critique": "The document is a formal directive from the President regarding exemptions from military service during wartime. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of urgency and importance related to maintaining national interests and ensuring fair application of the Selective Service Act. There's a subtle undercurrent of concern about potential abuse of the exemption process. There is no explicit display of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on concern or seriousness.",
