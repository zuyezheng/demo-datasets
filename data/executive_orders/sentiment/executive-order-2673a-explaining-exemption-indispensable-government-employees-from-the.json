    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim at conveying a sense of duty, seriousness, and perhaps a touch of fear regarding the consequences of not adhering to the Selective Service Act. It emphasizes the importance of national interests during wartime and discourages exemptions unless absolutely necessary. The order does not seem to aim to evoke joy or surprise. Disgust is not a primary emotion, but there might be a slight sense of disgust towards those who might try to evade the draft without proper justification. Sadness is not a primary emotion, but there might be a slight sense of sadness towards those who are drafted.",
