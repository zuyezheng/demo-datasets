    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the delegation of authority related to import controls of arms and ammunition. It is primarily a legal and administrative document. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotions, if any, would be very mild. I will assign initial scores reflecting this, and then revise them to be even more conservative, closer to 1 across the board, to reflect the document's neutral nature and lack of emotional content.",
