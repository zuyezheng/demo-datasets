The primary goal is to convey a sense of optimism, confidence, and strategic direction. It aims to instill joy through the promise of economic growth and improved quality of life, while also addressing potential fears and concerns through the protection of civil liberties and national security. Surprise is not a primary emotion intended to be conveyed. Disgust and sadness are not relevant emotions in this context.",
