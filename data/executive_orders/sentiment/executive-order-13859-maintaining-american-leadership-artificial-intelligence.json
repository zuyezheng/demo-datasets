The primary emotions conveyed are related to national security, economic growth, and maintaining American leadership. There is a sense of optimism and determination, but not necessarily strong emotions like joy or sadness. Fear and disgust are not prominent, but there is a subtle undercurrent of concern about strategic competitors. Surprise is not a major factor.",
