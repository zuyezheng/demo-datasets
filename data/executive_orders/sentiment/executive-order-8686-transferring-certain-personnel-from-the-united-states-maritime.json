    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, transferring employees from one agency to another. There's no indication of an intent to evoke strong emotions in the audience. Therefore, all emotion scores should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, since this is a formal document with no emotional language, I will revise all scores to 1, indicating a very minimal emotional impact.",
