    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land allocation. It does not explicitly express any particular emotion. The language is neutral and factual. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After further consideration, while the document itself is neutral, the act of canceling a reservation for Native American Indians could evoke negative emotions such as sadness, disgust, and perhaps even fear or surprise in some members of the public, depending on their views and understanding of the historical context. However, since the document itself doesn't express these emotions, the scores should remain relatively low, but slightly elevated from a baseline of 1.",
