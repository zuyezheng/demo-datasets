    "critique": "The document is an executive order detailing the transfer of fiscal and personnel functions between government agencies during World War II. It is a formal and administrative document. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal. Most emotions would be very low. Given the context of the war, there might be a slight sense of surprise at the reorganization, but overall, the emotional impact is negligible.",
