    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on improving regulation and regulatory review. The language is formal and aims to convey a sense of responsibility, order, and efficiency. There's an emphasis on public participation, scientific integrity, and retrospective analysis of existing rules. The overall tone is intended to be reassuring and authoritative, not particularly emotional. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
