    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a simple administrative update, renaming Customs Collection Districts with numbers. There's no indication of an attempt to evoke any strong emotions in the audience. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, while the order is primarily administrative, a tiny sense of surprise might be intended as the audience learns about the renaming. However, this would be very subtle.",
