    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform about changes in responsibilities related to recreation and natural beauty. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low.The initial scores are all set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order does not strongly convey any of the emotions. Therefore, the revised scores remain the same.",
