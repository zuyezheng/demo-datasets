    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a determination regarding nuclear cooperation and its impact on national security and nonproliferation objectives. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the determination that failure to continue cooperation would 'jeopardize the common defense and security of the United States' suggests a degree of concern or perhaps even fear. However, given the formal nature of the document, the emotional intensity is likely low.",
