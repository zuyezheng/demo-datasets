    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that outlines the delegation of power from the President to the Secretary of the Interior regarding the regulation of interstate and foreign commerce in petroleum and its products. The language is formal and technical, and the purpose is to establish a clear chain of command and supersede previous orders. The intended audience is likely government officials and legal professionals. The document does not aim to evoke strong emotions in the general public, but rather to ensure the efficient and lawful execution of policy. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
