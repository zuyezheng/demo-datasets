The order is about establishing a new Foreign Service Schedule, which might bring a slight sense of joy to those who benefit from it, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy. The revised scores are even lower, reflecting a more neutral stance.",
