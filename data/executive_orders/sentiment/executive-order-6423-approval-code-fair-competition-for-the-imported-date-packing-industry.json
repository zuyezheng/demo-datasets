    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Imported Date Packing Industry. The language is legal and procedural, with no strong emotional indicators. The president is conveying a sense of duty and compliance with the law. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal. Considering that, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After a second thought, I will revise the scores to reflect the formal and unemotional nature of the document.",
