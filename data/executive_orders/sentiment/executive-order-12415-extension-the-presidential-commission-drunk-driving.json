    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the termination date of a commission related to drunk driving. It expresses the President's authority and intent to continue efforts against drunk driving. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a subtle sense of determination and commitment to public safety might be inferred. Given the formal nature, the emotional intensity is likely low.",
