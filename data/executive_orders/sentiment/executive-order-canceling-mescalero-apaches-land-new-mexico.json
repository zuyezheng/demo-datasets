    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Mescalero Apaches. It primarily uses neutral and legal language. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the act of setting aside land for the Mescalero Apaches could be interpreted as a positive action, potentially reducing fear and sadness related to displacement. Given the formal nature and lack of emotional indicators, the initial scores are set to 1 for all emotions. After a second thought, I still believe the scores should be 1 as there isn't enough information to suggest any strong emotions being conveyed.",
