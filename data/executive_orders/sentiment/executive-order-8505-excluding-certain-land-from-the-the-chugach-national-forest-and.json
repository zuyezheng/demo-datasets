It primarily concerns legal and administrative actions, specifically excluding land from a national forest and reserving it for townsite purposes related to railroad construction. There is no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Considering it is a formal document, a baseline of 1 is appropriate for all emotions in the initial scores.",
