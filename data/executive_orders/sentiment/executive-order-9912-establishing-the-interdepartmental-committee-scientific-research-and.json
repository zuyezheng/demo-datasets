    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's handling of scientific research and development. There might be a subtle element of surprise at the scope and organization of the committee, but overall, the tone is formal and focused on efficiency and national welfare.The initial scores reflect a moderate level of joy (confidence), a slight surprise at the scope, and minimal levels of other emotions. After further consideration, I've slightly adjusted the scores to better reflect the intended tone and impact of the order.",
