    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document regarding land use. It does not seem to evoke any strong emotions. The order revokes a previous order and opens land for homesteading by ex-service men. While this may bring some joy to those who can now claim land, the document itself is neutral in tone. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
