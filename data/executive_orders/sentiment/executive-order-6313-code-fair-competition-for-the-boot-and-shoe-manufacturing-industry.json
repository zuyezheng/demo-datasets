It's about implementing a code of fair competition, so it should evoke a sense of trust and perhaps mild optimism. There's no strong emotional appeal, but a subtle sense of joy that things are being handled correctly and a slight surprise that there was confusion in the first place. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
