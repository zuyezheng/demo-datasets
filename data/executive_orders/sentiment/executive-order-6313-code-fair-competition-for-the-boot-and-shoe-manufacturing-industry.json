    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Boot and Shoe Manufacturing Industry. The language is legal and administrative, with no strong emotional cues. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment, but not in an overtly emotional way. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After a second thought, I realized that the document does not convey any specific emotion. Therefore, I will set all the initial scores to 1.",
