    "critique": "The document expresses a strong dislike for paper straws and a determination to eliminate their use within the federal government. The tone is assertive and decisive, reflecting a sense of disgust towards paper straws and a surprise that they are being used. There isn't necessarily an attempt to evoke strong emotions in the reader, but rather to convey a policy decision. Therefore, the emotion scores should be relatively low, with disgust and surprise being the most prominent.",
