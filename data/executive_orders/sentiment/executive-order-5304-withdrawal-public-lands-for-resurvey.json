    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that withdraws public lands from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation, pending a resurvey of said township. The order is factual and does not contain any emotional language. Therefore, the president does not want the audience to feel any particular emotion. The initial scores for all emotions should be 1. After further consideration, the score for surprise could be slightly higher, as the audience might be surprised by the order. However, the overall emotional impact is minimal.",
