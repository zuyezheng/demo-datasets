    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of urgency and resolve during wartime. It should instill a sense of confidence and security, while also acknowledging the seriousness of the situation. The primary emotions to convey are a sense of confidence (joy) that the war effort will be successful, a degree of fear regarding potential disruptions to the war effort, and a touch of surprise that such measures are necessary. There might also be a hint of disgust towards those disrupting the war effort, but it's not a primary emotion. The order does not want to convey sadness.",
