The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death of a former president. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is moderate, as it is a formal announcement rather than a personal expression of grief.The initial scores are based on the context of the document, which is a formal announcement of a death and instructions for mourning.
