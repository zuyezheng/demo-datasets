    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement of the death of a former president and instructions for mourning. The primary emotion conveyed should be sadness, with a touch of respect and solemnity. There is no intention to evoke joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness should be moderate, as it is a formal announcement rather than a personal expression of grief.",
