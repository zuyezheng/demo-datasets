    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of joy and hope by highlighting the importance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and the opportunities they provide. It also seeks to address the sadness and frustration stemming from the funding disparities faced by HSIs. There might be a subtle element of surprise conveyed by the statistics presented, such as the significant number of Pell Grant recipients attending HSIs despite their smaller proportion of postsecondary institutions. However, the primary emotions are joy and hope, with a secondary focus on addressing sadness and frustration.",
