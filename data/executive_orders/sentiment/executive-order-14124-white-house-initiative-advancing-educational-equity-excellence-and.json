    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a commitment to supporting Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and advancing educational equity. The language is formal and policy-oriented. There is a sense of optimism and determination to improve opportunities for Hispanic and Latino students. However, the primary tone is one of serious intent and commitment rather than overt emotional expression. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be scored relatively low, with joy being slightly higher due to the positive nature of the initiative.",
