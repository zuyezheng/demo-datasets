    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission on veterans' pensions. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional content. The primary goal is to convey authority and establish a process. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy, as the public might feel some relief knowing veterans' pensions are being reviewed.",
