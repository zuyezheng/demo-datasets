The order is about granting competitive classified status to certain attorneys. It is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are all 1. After further consideration, I will keep the scores at 1, as the document is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions.",
