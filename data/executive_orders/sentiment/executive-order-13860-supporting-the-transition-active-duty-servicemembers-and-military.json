It also seeks to convey a sense of reassurance and reduce fear by addressing the shortage of qualified merchant mariners and strengthening the sealift fleet. There might be a hint of surprise at the mention of expanding global footprints of strategic competitors, but it's not a primary emotion. Disgust and sadness are not intended emotions.",
