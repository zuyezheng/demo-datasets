    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document about land management. It does not seem to evoke any strong emotions. The order is amending a previous order to allow for the sale or lease of certain lands, and to clarify the status of mining claims. There is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
