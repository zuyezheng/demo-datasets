    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order related to World War I. It waives a previous order to allow Treasury Department employees to serve on state and local defense committees. The primary purpose is to mobilize and conserve resources. Given the context of WWI, a sense of urgency and resolve might be present, but the language is formal and measured. Therefore, I will assign low scores to most emotions, with a slightly elevated score for surprise due to the waiving of a previous order.",
