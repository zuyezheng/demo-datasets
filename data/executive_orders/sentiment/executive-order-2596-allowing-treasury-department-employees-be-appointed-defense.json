    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to mobilize resources during a critical time. It seeks to convey a sense of preparedness and proactive action rather than fear, disgust, or sadness. The primary emotion is a mild sense of joy or optimism that the government is taking action. There might be a hint of surprise at the government's flexibility in waiving previous restrictions, but it's not the main focus. The order does not seem to want to convey any negative emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy and surprise being the only emotions with non-zero scores. After reflection, I think the initial scores are appropriate.",
