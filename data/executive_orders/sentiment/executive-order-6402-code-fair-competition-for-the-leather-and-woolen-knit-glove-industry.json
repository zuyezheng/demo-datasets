    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Leather and Woolen Knit Glove Industry. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and compliance with the law. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal. I will assign low scores across all emotions initially, and then revise them slightly upwards to acknowledge the potential for a mild sense of reassurance or optimism due to the government taking action to regulate industry.",
