    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily focuses on administrative changes, specifically renaming and reassigning responsibilities from the 'Commissioner of Education' to the 'Assistant Secretary (for Education)'. Given the nature of the document, the emotional intensity is expected to be low across all emotions. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion.",
