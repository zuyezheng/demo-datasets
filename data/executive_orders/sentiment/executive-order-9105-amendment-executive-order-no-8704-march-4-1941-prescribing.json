It primarily deals with logistical and financial matters. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content.",
