    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of official procedure and legal authority rather than any specific emotion. The language is formal and precise, with no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After a second thought, since this is a formal order, it is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions in the American public. The scores should remain very low.",
