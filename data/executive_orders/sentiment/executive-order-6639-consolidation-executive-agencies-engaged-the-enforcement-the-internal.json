    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that reorganizes government functions. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is primarily concerned with transferring functions, records, personnel, and appropriations related to the Bureau of Industrial Alcohol and the Department of Justice to the Bureau of Internal Revenue. While it may bring a sense of order and efficiency, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low.",
