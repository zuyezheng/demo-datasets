The order aims to convey a sense of gratitude and respect for the members of the Armed Forces who have served in military operations to combat terrorism. It also aims to convey a sense of national unity and resolve in the face of terrorism. The order does not aim to convey any negative emotions such as sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. It may aim to convey a sense of surprise that it took so long to create these medals.",
