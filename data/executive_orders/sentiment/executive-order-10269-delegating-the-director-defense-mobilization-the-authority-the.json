    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding delegation of authority for determining critical areas related to national defense activities and school construction. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The language is formal and bureaucratic, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, a low score is appropriate for all emotions. Since there is not enough information to portray any emotion, I will use a score of 1 for each.",
