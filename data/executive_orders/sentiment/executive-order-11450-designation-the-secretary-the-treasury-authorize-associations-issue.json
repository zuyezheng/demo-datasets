    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that designates the Secretary of the Treasury to take action related to the Customs Convention on the International Transport of Goods Under Cover of TIR Carnets. The order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to convey a sense of official procedure and legal compliance rather than to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
