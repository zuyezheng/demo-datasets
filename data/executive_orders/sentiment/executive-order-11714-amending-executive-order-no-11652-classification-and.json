    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order. It primarily deals with establishing an Interagency Classification Review Committee. Given the nature of the document, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There might be a slight sense of importance or seriousness, but overall, the emotional intensity is low. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions initially. Then upon review, I will increase the surprise score to 2, as the document is unexpected.",
