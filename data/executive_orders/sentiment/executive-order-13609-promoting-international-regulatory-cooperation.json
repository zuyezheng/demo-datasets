    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining policy and procedures. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order, cooperation, and regulatory efficiency. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are subtle. There might be a hint of joy that international regulatory cooperation can promote economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not an emotion the document intends to evoke.",
