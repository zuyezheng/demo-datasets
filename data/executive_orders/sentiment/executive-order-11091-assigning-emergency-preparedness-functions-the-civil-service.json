    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the responsibilities of the Civil Service Commission in preparing for national emergencies. The language is very formal and procedural. The order aims to instill a sense of preparedness and confidence in the government's ability to handle emergencies. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel joy, sadness, or disgust. There might be a slight element of fear or surprise, but the dominant emotion is a sense of reassurance and preparedness. Therefore, I will score surprise a 3 and fear a 2. All other emotions will be scored a 1.",
