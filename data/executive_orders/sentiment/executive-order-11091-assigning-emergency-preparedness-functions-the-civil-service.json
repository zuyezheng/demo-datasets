    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order outlining the responsibilities of the Civil Service Commission in preparing for national emergencies. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on planning, coordination, and preparedness. There is a sense of seriousness and urgency due to the context of national emergencies, but no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight increase in fear and surprise due to the emergency context.",
