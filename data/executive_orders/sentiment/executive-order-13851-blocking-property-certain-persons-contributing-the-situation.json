The order likely intends to evoke feelings of concern and perhaps a sense of urgency. It does not seem to want to evoke joy. It could evoke sadness because of the human rights abuses. It could evoke anger at the regime. It could evoke fear because of the national emergency. It could evoke disgust at the corruption. It could evoke surprise because of the national emergency.",
