It seeks to convey a sense of opportunity and progress, particularly in the face of global challenges. Therefore, the primary emotion should be joy, with secondary emotions of surprise at the new initiatives and perhaps a touch of hope to counter sadness related to global challenges. Disgust, fear, and anger are not emotions the order tries to convey.",
