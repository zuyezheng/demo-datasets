    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority related to disaster relief. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across all emotions. Upon review, the initial assessment seems accurate as the document is purely administrative and lacks emotional content.",
