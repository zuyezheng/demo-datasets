    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the line of succession for the Secretary of the Interior. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such an order is necessary, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
