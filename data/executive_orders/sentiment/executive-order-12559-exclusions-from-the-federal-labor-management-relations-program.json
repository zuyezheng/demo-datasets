It primarily concerns legal and administrative matters, specifically amending a previous executive order to exempt certain agencies within the Department of Justice from the Federal Labor-Management Relations Program. The language is formal and devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be very low, close to 1, indicating a minimal presence of any particular emotion. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
