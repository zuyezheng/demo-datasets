    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It amends a previous executive order to increase the membership and extend the life of a committee. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of determination or resolve, but it is very muted. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for resolve which can be interpreted as joy.",
