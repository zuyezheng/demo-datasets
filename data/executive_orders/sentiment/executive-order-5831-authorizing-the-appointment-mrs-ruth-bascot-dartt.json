    "critique": "The executive order is about appointing a widow of a deceased marine to a clerk position. The order aims to evoke a sense of sympathy and perhaps a touch of gratitude for the sacrifice of the marine. Therefore, sadness and perhaps a little joy that the widow is being taken care of are the emotions that should be conveyed. The intensity of sadness should be moderate, and the intensity of joy should be low.",
