    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the facts of a labor dispute and establishing a board to investigate it. It doesn't seem to intentionally evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and procedural, suggesting an intention to maintain objectivity and impartiality. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values.",
