    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It expresses concern about potential disruption to interstate commerce and establishes a board to investigate the matter. The primary emotion conveyed is concern, with a hint of urgency. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise. Fear is present due to the potential disruption of essential services. Based on this, I will assign initial scores and then revise them after further consideration.",
