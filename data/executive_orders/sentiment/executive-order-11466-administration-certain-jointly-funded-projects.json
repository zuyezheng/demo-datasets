    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, legal document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about authorizing the Director of the Bureau of the Budget to designate projects for joint funding and to prescribe regulations. It also allows agencies to waive technical grant requirements under certain conditions. There is no indication of an intent to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
