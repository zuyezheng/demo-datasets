    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about the rehabilitation program for registrants. It does not seem to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is more about authorization and delegation of power to the Director of Selective Service. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, the order might evoke a slight sense of surprise as it is unexpected, but the intensity would still be very low.",
