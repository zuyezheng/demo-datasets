    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the collection of delinquent child support obligations. It expresses a commitment to supporting children and strengthening families. The language is formal and legalistic. Joy is present in the intent to support children, but it's not a dominant emotion. Sadness is present due to the problem of parents failing to meet child support obligations. There's no explicit anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document. The scores reflect these considerations.",
