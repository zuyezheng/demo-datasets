    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority related to water pollution control. It is primarily concerned with assigning responsibilities and ensuring compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Therefore, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There might be a slight sense of responsibility and concern for public health, but these are not strongly emphasized. Most emotions are therefore scored low.",
