    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority related to water pollution control. It is primarily legal and administrative in nature. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The primary emotions, if any, might be related to a sense of security (or lack thereof) regarding environmental protection. However, the language is very technical and unlikely to generate a strong emotional response. Most people won't read it or understand it. I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for fear, as environmental concerns can sometimes trigger fear.",
