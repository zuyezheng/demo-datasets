    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that assigns responsibility for preventing and cleaning up oil and hazardous substance spills. The primary goal is to ensure the environment is protected. The order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, it could inspire a sense of relief and perhaps even a little joy that the government is taking action to protect the environment. It could also cause a bit of fear and disgust about the potential for environmental disasters if these regulations weren't in place. However, these emotions are very mild.",
