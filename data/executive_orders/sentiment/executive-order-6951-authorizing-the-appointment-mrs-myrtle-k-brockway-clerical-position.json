    "critique": "The executive order seems to convey a sense of compassion and justification for the appointment of Mrs. Brockway. The order highlights her late husband's service and sacrifice, suggesting a desire for the audience to feel sympathy and perhaps a touch of gratitude. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotions are sadness (due to the loss of her husband) and perhaps a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the government is helping her. The intensity of these emotions is relatively low, as the order is formal and bureaucratic in nature.",
