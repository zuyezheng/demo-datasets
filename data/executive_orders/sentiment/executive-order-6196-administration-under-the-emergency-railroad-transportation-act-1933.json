    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and confidence in addressing the economic emergency related to railroad transportation. It highlights the actions taken to relieve obstructions and maintain a national system of transportation. The order uses formal language and references specific acts and provisions, which contributes to a sense of authority and seriousness. The emotions the president wants to convey are more aligned with reassurance and confidence rather than strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to instill a sense of trust in the government's actions during a time of crisis.",
