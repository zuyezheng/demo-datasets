    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land use within Huron National Forest. It primarily concerns the revocation of a previous order and reaffirms existing land reservations. Given the nature of the document, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is purely administrative and legal in tone. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be very low, close to 1, indicating a negligible presence of these emotions.",
