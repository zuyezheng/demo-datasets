    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It withdraws oil shale deposits from lease for investigation and classification. There's no explicit intention to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue that there might be a subtle element of surprise, as the public might not expect such an order. There might also be a very mild sense of reassurance (joy) that the government is taking steps to manage resources. The order itself is neutral, so the scores should be low.",
