    "critique": "The executive order cancels a previous order that set aside land for the Jicarilla Apache Indians, returning the land to the public domain. This action likely evokes sadness and perhaps fear among the affected population, and potentially disgust among those who disapprove of the decision. Joy might be felt by those who benefit from the land being returned to the public domain. Surprise is unlikely to be a strong emotion, as such orders are not entirely unexpected.The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
