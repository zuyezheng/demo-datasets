    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation. It cancels a previous order that designated land for the Jicarilla Apache Indians and restores the land to the public domain. The language is legal and administrative, devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Since there is not enough information to portray any emotion, a score of 1 is appropriate for each.",
