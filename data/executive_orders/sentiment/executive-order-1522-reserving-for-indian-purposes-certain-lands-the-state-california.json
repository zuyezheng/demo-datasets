    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal for Indian use. It's a legal document, so it's unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of hope or relief for the Native Americans, but it's very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy and surprise due to the potential positive impact on Native Americans.",
