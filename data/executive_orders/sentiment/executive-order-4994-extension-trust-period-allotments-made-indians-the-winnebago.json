    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It extends a trust period for certain Native American allotments. There's no indication of an intent to evoke strong emotions. The most likely emotion might be a mild sense of reassurance or satisfaction for the beneficiaries, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, I'll score all emotions very low initially. After reflection, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
