    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal and legal document. It cites specific sections of revenue acts and describes the authorization for a special committee to inspect certain returns. The language is very technical and procedural. Therefore, it is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. The primary goal is to communicate a legal decision and authorization.",
