    "critique": "The document primarily discusses consular court fees and fines, focusing on their official status, usage for court expenses, and reporting requirements. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, aiming to establish procedures rather than evoke emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default of 1 due to the lack of emotional content.",
