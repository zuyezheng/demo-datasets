    "critique": "The document is a military order from the President. It lacks explicit emotional language. However, given the context of potential war, it could evoke a mix of emotions. Fear and sadness might be present due to the prospect of soldiers leaving for war. Surprise is unlikely, as this was probably anticipated. Disgust is not relevant. Joy is also unlikely. I will score fear and sadness higher than the others.",
