    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that primarily aims to convey information and instructions related to the continuation, amendment, and revocation of various executive orders and committees. It is unlikely that the president intends to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order is more about administrative and legal matters than about stirring feelings. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact.",
