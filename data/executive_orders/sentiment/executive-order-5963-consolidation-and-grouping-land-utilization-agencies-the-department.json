The primary goal is to increase efficiency and reduce expenditures. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, there might be a subtle sense of joy or optimism related to the intended positive outcomes of the reorganization (increased efficiency), and a lack of surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness.",
