    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of duty, fairness, and national unity. It establishes a commission to review selective service, emphasizing fairness, military needs, and individual well-being. The order seeks to convey a sense of responsibility and reasoned decision-making, not strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are low across the board. Upon further reflection, the order does evoke a slight sense of reassurance and hope that the selective service system will be fair and just. Therefore, I will revise the joy score to 3.",
