    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about an amendment to civil service rules. It concerns positions within the Navy Department in the Philippine Islands. The language is neutral and factual, without any explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions.I will assign a low score of 1 for all emotions initially, as the document does not convey any strong sentiment.After further consideration, the document is purely informational and unlikely to evoke any significant emotional response. Therefore, the initial scores are appropriate and do not require revision.",
