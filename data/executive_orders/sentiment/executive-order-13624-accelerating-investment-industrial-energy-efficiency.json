    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on promoting American manufacturing through energy efficiency. It aims to reduce energy costs, improve competitiveness, and create jobs. The language is formal and policy-oriented. There's a sense of optimism and determination to achieve these goals, but it's conveyed in a professional and measured tone. Therefore, the scores should reflect this formal and optimistic tone, with low scores for negative emotions and moderate scores for positive emotions like joy and surprise (at the potential benefits).",
