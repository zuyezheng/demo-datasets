    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that outlines changes to special pay for enlisted personnel serving on sea duty. The language is technical and legalistic. The order aims to provide clarity and structure around pay entitlements. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to inform and direct, not to evoke an emotional response. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
