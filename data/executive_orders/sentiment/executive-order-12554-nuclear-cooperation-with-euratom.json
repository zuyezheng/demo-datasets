    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and stability rather than strong emotional responses. It focuses on maintaining peaceful nuclear cooperation and preventing jeopardizing national security. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed might be a mild sense of reassurance or perhaps a slight reduction in fear or anxiety about nuclear proliferation. There's no indication of joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise being intentionally conveyed. The language is formal and legalistic, further minimizing emotional impact. Revised scores reflect this: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1",
