    "critique": "The document is a formal authorization from the President regarding the Tennessee Valley Authority. It focuses on the development and conservation of natural resources. There is a sense of purpose and direction, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Joy might be present in the sense of promoting general welfare, but it's not overt. Sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are not evident in the text. Therefore, these emotions should be scored low.",
