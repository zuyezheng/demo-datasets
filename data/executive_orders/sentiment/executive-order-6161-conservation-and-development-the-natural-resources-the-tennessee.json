    "critique": "The document is a formal authorization from the President regarding the Tennessee Valley Authority. It focuses on the use, conservation, and development of natural resources and the promotion of general welfare. The language is formal and legalistic, lacking strong emotional cues. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions due to the document's neutral tone and lack of explicit emotional expression. Upon review, the initial assessment holds. The document's purpose is administrative and directive, not designed to evoke strong emotions.",
