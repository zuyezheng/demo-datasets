    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a fairly standard government document. It authorizes the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority to conduct surveys, plans, studies, experiments, and demonstrations to aid in the use, conservation, and development of natural resources. It also aims to promote the general welfare of citizens in the Tennessee River drainage basin. There is nothing in the text that seems designed to evoke strong emotions. Perhaps a tiny bit of joy that the government is working to improve the lives of citizens and conserve natural resources. The order seems too dry to evoke any other emotion.",
