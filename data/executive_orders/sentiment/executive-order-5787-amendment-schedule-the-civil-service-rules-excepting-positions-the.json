    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to a schedule of excepted positions within the Department of Justice. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is a statement that the order is designed to improve the service. There is no explicit emotional language. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After a second thought, the statement that the order is designed to improve the service could be interpreted as a slight expression of joy or optimism, but it's very subtle. The document aims to be neutral and factual.",
