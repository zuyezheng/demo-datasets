    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to convey a sense of seriousness and resolve. It invokes legal authority and outlines specific actions to be taken against Libya. The primary emotion it seeks to evoke is a sense of concern and resolve regarding the stated threat (Libyan support for terrorism). It may also aim to instill a degree of fear in those who might consider violating the order. There may also be a sense of disgust towards the actions of the Libyan government. There is no intention to evoke joy or surprise.",
