    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing military commissions. It defines terms, supersedes previous orders, and outlines general provisions. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be neutral. However, depending on their political views, some people may feel fear or anger. Given the lack of emotional language, I will assign low scores across all emotions. I will revise the scores to reflect a slightly elevated sense of fear due to the nature of the order.",
