    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to instill a sense of security and perhaps a controlled level of fear or seriousness regarding national security. It establishes military commissions for alien unlawful enemy combatants, which could evoke fear in some, but also a sense of justice and order in others. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotions would likely be fear and perhaps a muted sense of surprise that such measures are being taken.",
