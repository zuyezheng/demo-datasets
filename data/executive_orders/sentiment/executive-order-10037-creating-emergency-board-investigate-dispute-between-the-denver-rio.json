    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It expresses a sense of urgency and authority, but avoids strong emotional language. The primary emotion conveyed, albeit subtly, is concern (leading to a low fear score) about the potential disruption of interstate commerce. There's a hint of disappointment (leading to a low sadness score) that the dispute hasn't been resolved through normal channels. There's no explicit joy, disgust, or surprise. The language is very measured and neutral.",
