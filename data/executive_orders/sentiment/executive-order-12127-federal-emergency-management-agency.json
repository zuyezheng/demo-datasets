    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the activation of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It primarily deals with the transfer of functions and responsibilities from various departments to the new agency. Given the formal and legal nature of the document, the emotional tone is expected to be neutral. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to establish and organize a government agency, focusing on legal and administrative aspects rather than emotional appeals. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional presence.",
