    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that establishes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). It primarily deals with the transfer of functions and responsibilities from various departments to FEMA. The language is legal and administrative, focusing on clarity and precision rather than emotional appeal. There is a mild sense of reassurance that the government is taking steps to manage emergencies effectively. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not intended, as the order is a planned action. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
