    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Export Council. It outlines the council's membership, functions, administrative provisions, and general provisions. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the order aims to promote United States export trade, which could be interpreted as conveying a sense of optimism and determination. Therefore, I will assign low scores for joy and surprise, and a score of 1 for the other emotions.",
