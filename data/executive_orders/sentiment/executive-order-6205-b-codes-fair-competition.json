    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the fairness and efficiency of the National Industrial Recovery Act. It addresses potential concerns about the code's application and provides a mechanism for those affected to seek adjustments. The order does not seem to want to evoke strong emotions. The strongest emotion might be a low level of reassurance or reduced fear, with slight surprise that their concerns are being addressed. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. The revised scores are similar, with a slight increase in joy and surprise to reflect the positive aspects of the order.",
