    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order that defines the boundaries of a land tract for the use of the Pima and Maricopa Indians. The primary purpose is to establish a legal description, not to convey emotion. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. There is a slight sense of joy in providing land for the Indians, but it is very subdued. There might be a slight hint of sadness that land needs to be taken for this purpose, but it is also very subdued. Surprise, fear, disgust are not conveyed.",
