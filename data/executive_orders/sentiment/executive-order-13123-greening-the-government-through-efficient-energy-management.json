    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on energy conservation and efficiency within the Federal Government. It outlines goals, strategies, and responsibilities for various agencies. The language is formal and technical, with no overt expression of emotions. However, a sense of optimism and determination can be inferred from the ambitious goals and the call for leadership. There is a mild sense of concern about environmental issues, which motivates the order. Therefore, I will assign low scores for joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise, and a slightly higher score for determination.",
