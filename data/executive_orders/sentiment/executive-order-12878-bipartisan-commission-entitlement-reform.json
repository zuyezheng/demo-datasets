    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of seriousness and importance, but not necessarily to evoke strong emotions. It's more about establishing a commission and outlining its functions. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
