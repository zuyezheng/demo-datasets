The language is formal and legalistic, indicating a serious and official tone. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary purpose is to convey approval and establish the effective date of the provisions. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional content.",
