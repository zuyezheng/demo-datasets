    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Lee H. Garby. It mentions her previous work and the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, but also notes the Civil Service Commission's non-concurrence. The tone is neutral and bureaucratic, with a hint of advocacy for Mrs. Garby's appointment. There is a slight sense of justification or persuasion, but overall, the emotional content is minimal. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive outcome for Mrs. Garby.",
