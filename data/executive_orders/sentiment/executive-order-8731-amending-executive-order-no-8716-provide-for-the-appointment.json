    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and stability during a time of national defense. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Instead, it focuses on ensuring the smooth operation of the National Defense Mediation Board by providing alternate members. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order and preparedness, minimizing potential disruptions. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
