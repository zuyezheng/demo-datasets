    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the establishment of a Presidential Transition Coordinating Council and its responsibilities. The primary goal is to ensure a smooth and organized transfer of power between administrations. Therefore, the emotions conveyed should be neutral and focused on stability and order. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to inspire confidence in the transition process and reassure the public of a seamless continuation of government functions.",
