The order is about land allocation for experimental tree planting, which might bring a slight sense of joy or hope for the future, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy. The revised scores are even lower, as the emotional impact is truly minimal.",
