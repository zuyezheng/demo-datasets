    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that delegates responsibility and authority to various government officials and agencies regarding water pollution control. The order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. However, the actions mandated by the order could lead to feelings of joy (due to environmental protection), fear (due to potential pollution), or disgust (due to existing pollution). The primary goal of the document is to inform and direct, not to evoke emotion. Therefore, the emotional scores should be relatively low.",
