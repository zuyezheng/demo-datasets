    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding water pollution control. It primarily delegates responsibilities and authorities to various government officials and agencies. There is no explicit emotional language or sentiment expressed in the document. The president is conveying a sense of responsibility and determination to address water pollution, but this is not directly expressed as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default score of 1.",
