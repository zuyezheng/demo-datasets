It highlights the threat they pose to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. The order seeks to instill a sense of fear and perhaps disgust towards these organizations and their activities. There is no intention to evoke joy or surprise. Sadness might be a secondary emotion due to the negative impact of these organizations on society.",
