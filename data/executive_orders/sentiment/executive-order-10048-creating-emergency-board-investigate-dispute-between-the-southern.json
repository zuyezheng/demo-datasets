It addresses a dispute and establishes a board to investigate, suggesting a desire to resolve the issue peacefully and efficiently. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The order does not seem to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
