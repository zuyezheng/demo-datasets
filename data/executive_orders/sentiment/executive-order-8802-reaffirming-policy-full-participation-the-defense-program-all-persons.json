It aims to convey a sense of justice and equality, while also acknowledging the detrimental effects of discrimination on national unity and morale. The emotions conveyed are subtle, but present.

Fear is also moderate, stemming from the potential consequences of disunity and hindered defense production. Disgust is present, directed towards the discriminatory practices. Surprise is minimal, as the document seems to address an existing issue rather than introducing a sudden change.",
