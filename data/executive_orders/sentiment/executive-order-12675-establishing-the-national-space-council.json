    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the National Space Council. It is primarily concerned with outlining the structure, functions, and responsibilities of the council. The language is formal and procedural, with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional expression in the document. I will assign a score of 1 for all emotions initially, as there is not enough information to suggest any specific emotional response. Upon further review, I will keep the scores at 1, as the document is purely informational and procedural, lacking any emotional appeal.",
