    "critique": "The executive order seems to convey a sense of authority and finality. It aims to ensure compliance with the Resolution of Annexation and protect public lands in Hawaii. The primary emotions conveyed are related to the enforcement of rules and the correction of any unauthorized actions. There might be a slight sense of surprise that such sales occurred after the resolution, but overall, the dominant emotions are related to the seriousness of the matter.The order does not explicitly aim to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. However, there might be a mild sense of surprise that the sales occurred after the annexation resolution. The revised scores reflect this understanding.",
