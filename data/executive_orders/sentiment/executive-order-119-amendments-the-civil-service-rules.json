    "critique": "The executive order is primarily concerned with amending civil service rules. It is a formal document that aims to provide clarity and structure to government employment. The intended emotional response is likely to be a sense of order, fairness, and efficiency. There might be a slight sense of surprise at the extent of the changes, but overall, the document is not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, I will score joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust as low, and surprise as moderate.",
