    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement about government offices closing for a specific purpose: to allow employees to participate in decorating the graves of soldiers who died in the Civil War. The primary emotion the president wants to convey is sadness and respect for the fallen soldiers. There might also be a sense of solemn joy in honoring their memory. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Initial scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 7, Surprise: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 7, Surprise: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1. The initial and revised scores are the same because the reasoning is sound and the scores accurately reflect the emotions conveyed in the executive order.",
