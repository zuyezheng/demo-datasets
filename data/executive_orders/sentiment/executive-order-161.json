    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the administration of Puerto Rico and other islands. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The president is establishing offices and defining their roles, which suggests a focus on order and control rather than any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Since there is not enough information to portray any emotion, I will assign a score of 1 to each.",
