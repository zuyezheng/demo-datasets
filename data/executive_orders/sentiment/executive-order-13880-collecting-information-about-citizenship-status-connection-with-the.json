    "critique": "The document expresses disagreement with a Supreme Court ruling and outlines actions to gather citizenship data. It conveys a sense of determination to obtain this data despite the court's decision. There's a hint of frustration with the current immigration system and a desire for accurate data to inform policy decisions. The document does not explicitly express joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the tone suggests a level of concern about the current state of immigration data and a resolve to address it. The intensity of these emotions is relatively moderate, as the document maintains a formal and official tone.",
