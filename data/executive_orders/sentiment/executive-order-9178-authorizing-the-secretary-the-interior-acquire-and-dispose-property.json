    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a purely functional document authorizing the Secretary of Interior to manage property related to helium production for war purposes. There's no explicit attempt to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on authorization and necessity. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low, close to zero. Upon further reflection, while the document's primary goal isn't emotional, the context of the Second War Powers Act and the mention of 'military, naval, or other war purposes' might subtly introduce a sense of concern or seriousness. Therefore, I will adjust the fear score slightly upwards to reflect this underlying context.",
