    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding exemptions from environmental regulations for a federal facility temporarily housing Haitian nationals. The primary emotions conveyed are related to the urgency and necessity of the situation, but these are expressed in a very formal and detached manner. There is a slight undercurrent of concern for the well-being of the Haitian nationals, but it is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the scores should reflect this formality and detachment, with low scores for most emotions.",
