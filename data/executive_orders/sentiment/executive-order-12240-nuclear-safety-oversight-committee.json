    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the Nuclear Safety Oversight Committee. It primarily deals with amendments to a previous executive order, specifying details such as funding, termination date, and committee membership. There is no explicit expression of emotion in the document. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on legal and administrative details. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be neutral. Considering that there's not enough information to assign a score other than 1, the initial scores for all emotions are 1.",
