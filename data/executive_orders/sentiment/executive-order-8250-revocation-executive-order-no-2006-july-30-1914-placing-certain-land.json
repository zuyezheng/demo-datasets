    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land control in the Canal Zone. It revokes a previous order and returns land control to the Governor of The Panama Canal. There is no strong emotional language present. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of decisiveness or resolution, but overall, the emotional content is minimal. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on neutral emotions.",
