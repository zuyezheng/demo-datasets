    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the suspension of certain provisions of title 10 of the United States Code. It pertains to promotions within specific branches of the military. The language is legalistic and devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains the primary factor. The revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
