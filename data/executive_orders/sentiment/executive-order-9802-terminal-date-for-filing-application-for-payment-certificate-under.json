    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order regarding tax regulations. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The language is legal and administrative, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the document's neutral tone and content. Since there is not enough information to portray any emotion, a score of 1 will be given.",
