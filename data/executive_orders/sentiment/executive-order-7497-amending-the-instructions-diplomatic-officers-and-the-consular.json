    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of a regulation regarding Foreign Service officers marrying foreign nationals. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the regulation could be interpreted as conveying a sense of caution or concern about the potential impact of such marriages on the officers' availability and the efficiency of the Service. Therefore, I will assign low scores to fear and disgust, and a score of 1 to the other emotions.",
