    "critique": "The executive order discusses emergency preparedness and national security, which could evoke fear and concern. The mention of cooperation and planning might also inspire a sense of hope or joy, but to a lesser extent. The order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and urgency, so surprise, disgust, and sadness are less relevant.",
