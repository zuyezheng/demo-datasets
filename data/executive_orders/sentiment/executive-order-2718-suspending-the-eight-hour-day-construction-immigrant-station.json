    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of urgency and determination to address a national emergency. While it doesn't explicitly express emotions, the context suggests a focus on efficiency and resolving a critical situation. The mention of 'national emergency' and the suspension of labor laws indicate a serious tone. I will score surprise as 1 because the document does not contain information that evokes surprise.",
