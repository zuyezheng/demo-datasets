The primary emotions conveyed are fear (related to the threat of drug abuse) and a sense of determination (to address the issue). There's a hint of disgust towards drug abuse. Joy and surprise are not relevant in this context. Sadness might be a minor emotion, but less prominent than fear or determination.",
