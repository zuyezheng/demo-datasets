    "critique": "The document expresses sadness due to the death of ex-President Martin Van Buren. It also expresses respect and honor for his service. There is no explicit expression of joy, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is moderate, given the formal tone and the focus on national mourning rather than personal grief. The other emotions are minimal.",
