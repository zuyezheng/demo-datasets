    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine land transaction, specifically excluding a small tract of land from a national forest in Alaska and restoring it to entry under public-land laws. The language is formal and legalistic, and the content is specific to a particular piece of land and a particular individual. There is no indication that the president intends to evoke any particular emotion in the audience. The order simply executes a legal process related to land management. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
