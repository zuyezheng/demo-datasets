    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President. It establishes appointments to the International Military Tribunal. The language is legal and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, given the context of the tribunal, which is to try war criminals, there might be an implicit sense of justice and resolve. However, since the document itself does not express these emotions, I will assign low scores to all emotions.",
