    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily uses neutral and legal language. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order revokes previous executive orders and designates authority to specific secretaries. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the document's formal and unemotional nature. After further consideration, the scores remain low as the document is purely administrative and lacks emotional content.",
