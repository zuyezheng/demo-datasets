    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. The primary goal seems to be to convey a sense of optimism and confidence in the nation's ability to improve its economy and create jobs. There's an element of joy associated with job creation and prosperity, but it's not overt. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a prominent emotion. The language is formal and aims to project competence and authority. Therefore, joy is the most prominent emotion, but it is mild. The other emotions are not present.",
