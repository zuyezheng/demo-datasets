    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about transferring the United States Patent Office from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Commerce. It's a bureaucratic action, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is intended to be informative and authoritative, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
