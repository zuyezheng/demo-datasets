    "critique": "The executive order is primarily intended to convey a sense of seriousness and resolve in addressing the situation in Syria. It aims to evoke a feeling of concern about the violence in Syria (sadness) and a sense of urgency and determination to take action (surprise). There might be a slight element of fear conveyed, related to the potential consequences of the situation in Syria, and disgust at the actions of the Syrian government. However, joy is not an emotion that the order would want to convey.",
