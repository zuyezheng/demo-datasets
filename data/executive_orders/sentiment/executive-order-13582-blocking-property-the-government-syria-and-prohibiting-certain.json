    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order imposing sanctions on Syria. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of seriousness and resolve in addressing a national emergency. There might be a hint of disgust and sadness related to the violence in Syria, but these are secondary to the main purpose of the document, which is to enact policy. The order aims to project an image of the president taking decisive action. Therefore, the scores should reflect this.",
