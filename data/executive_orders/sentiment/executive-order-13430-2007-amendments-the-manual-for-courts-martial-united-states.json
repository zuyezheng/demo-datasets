    "critique": "The document is a legal order amending the Manual for Courts-Martial. It primarily deals with legal procedures and definitions, such as remote testimony, blood alcohol content limits, and offenses related to unborn children and stalking. There is no explicit emotional language or appeals. The President is acting in an official capacity, and the document's purpose is to update legal guidelines, not to evoke any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
