The primary emotion the president wants to convey is a sense of hope and reassurance that the government is taking action to address these inequities. There might also be a sense of sadness and concern for the affected communities, but the overall tone is one of determination and commitment to finding solutions. The order also wants to convey a sense of surprise that these inequities exist and are so severe.",
