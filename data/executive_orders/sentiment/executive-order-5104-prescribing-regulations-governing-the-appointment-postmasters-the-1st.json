    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and order. It outlines procedures for filling postmaster positions, emphasizing qualifications and examinations. There's a hint of relief that positions will be filled by qualified individuals. There is no strong emotion conveyed but the strongest is surprise that the order is so specific. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on surprise. The revised scores are similar, but with a slight decrease in surprise.",
