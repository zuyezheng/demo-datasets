    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative update regarding positions exempt from examination. It mentions confidential roles, suggesting a need for discretion and trust. The order itself doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue there's a hint of seriousness due to the confidential nature of the positions, which might translate to a very mild sense of importance or perhaps slight surprise that these specific roles are being addressed in this way. The civil service commission's concurrence might also suggest a very mild sense of reassurance or trust in the process. Therefore, I will assign low scores to surprise and trust and zero to the other emotions.",
