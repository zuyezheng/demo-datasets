    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that permanently withdraws a section of land for the use of the Pima and Maricopa Indians. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke any particular emotion. However, one could argue that it might evoke a sense of joy for those who support the rights of Native Americans, or perhaps sadness or anger for those who oppose it. However, the primary goal of the document is not to evoke emotion, but to enact a legal change. Therefore, the emotional scores should be relatively low.",
