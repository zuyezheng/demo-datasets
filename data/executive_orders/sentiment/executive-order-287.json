    "critique": "The document primarily consists of official orders and regulations. There is a sense of order and formality, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. The resignation of General Sherman might evoke some sadness, but it is handled in a very formal and procedural manner. The civil service rules aim for fairness and impartiality, further reducing emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on sadness due to the retirement.",
