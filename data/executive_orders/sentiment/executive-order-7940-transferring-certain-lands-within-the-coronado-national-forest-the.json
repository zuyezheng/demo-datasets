It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. The initial scores reflect this baseline expectation. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, a score of 1 is assigned to each of these emotions. The revised scores remain the same as the initial scores, as the critique confirms the initial assessment.",
