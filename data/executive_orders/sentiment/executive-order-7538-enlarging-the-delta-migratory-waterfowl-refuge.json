    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for a waterfowl refuge. It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. The primary purpose is to declare the reservation of land, not to evoke emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Considering the formal tone and subject matter, I will assign low scores across the board. There is a slight sense of joy due to the conservation efforts, but it's very subtle.",
