    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission. It uses formal language and aims to establish a sense of authority and purpose. There is no explicit emotional appeal. However, the subject matter (bioethics) could evoke different emotions in different people. The order itself is neutral in tone. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy, surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness are not explicitly conveyed.",
