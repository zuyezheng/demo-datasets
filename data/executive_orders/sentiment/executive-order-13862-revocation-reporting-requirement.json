    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal document outlining changes to reporting requirements regarding civilian casualties in US military operations. The language is very formal and legalistic. The order revokes a previous executive order requiring the Director of National Intelligence to release an unclassified summary of the number of strikes undertaken by the United States Government against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities, as well as assessments of combatant and non-combatant deaths resulting from those strikes. It does not seem designed to evoke any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
