    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the confiscation of Iraqi assets. It invokes legal authorities and declares the intent to use the assets to assist the Iraqi people and reconstruct Iraq. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of determination and resolve, but emotions are largely suppressed in favor of a professional tone. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low. There might be a slight sense of determination which could translate to a low level of joy.",
