    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for Sioux Indians. It's a legal and administrative document, so it doesn't express strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of hope or satisfaction (joy) for the intended beneficiaries, but it's very subdued. There's no explicit sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the text. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
