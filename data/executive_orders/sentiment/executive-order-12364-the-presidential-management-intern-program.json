    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish and manage the Presidential Management Intern Program. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of optimism and purpose, but emotions are largely suppressed in favor of a professional tone. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low. The order aims to attract outstanding employees, which suggests a degree of joy and optimism, but it's not overt. There's no explicit sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed. Veterans preference criteria is mentioned which can be interpreted as a sign of joy.",
