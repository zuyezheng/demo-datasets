    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Photo-Engraving Industry. The language is legal and administrative, with no clear emotional tone. The President is conveying a sense of duty and formality, not any strong emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After a second thought, the document does convey a mild sense of optimism and hope for fair competition, so joy can be slightly increased.",
