    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, progress, and confidence in the government's actions during the Great Depression. It's about implementing a code of fair competition, so it should evoke a sense of hope and perhaps mild joy that things are improving. There might be a touch of surprise at the level of detail and intervention, but overall, it's not designed to elicit strong emotions. The order is more about reassurance and stability. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the joy and reduce the surprise to better align with the intended effect.",
