    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order extending the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the context suggests a sense of concern about aviation security and terrorism, which could imply a low level of fear and possibly a touch of sadness or concern. Surprise, disgust, and joy are not relevant in this context. The initial scores are set accordingly, with fear and sadness at a low level and the rest at 1. After further consideration, the emotions are not explicitly conveyed, so I will reduce the fear and sadness scores to 1.",
