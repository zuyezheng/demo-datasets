    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of national security and economic prosperity through a strengthened cybersecurity workforce. It should evoke a feeling of confidence and preparedness rather than negative emotions. Therefore, joy and surprise are the most relevant emotions. Joy reflects the positive outcome of a secure and prosperous nation, while surprise might be a secondary emotion related to innovative approaches and recognition of cybersecurity talents. Fear, disgust, and sadness are not intended to be conveyed.",
