    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document that modifies a previous executive order to enable the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw public lands in Wyoming for use as a stock driveway. The language is formal and technical, and the purpose is to make a specific change to land management. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. The order is simply a legal instrument to achieve a specific administrative goal. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
