    "critique": "The executive order aims to address educational disparities faced by African Americans and promote equality and opportunity. The primary emotions the president likely wants to evoke are joy (through the promise of improved outcomes and opportunities), hope (for a better future), and perhaps a sense of urgency or concern (regarding the existing challenges). There might also be a subtle element of surprise at the extent of the disparities, but this is less prominent. I will score these emotions accordingly.",
