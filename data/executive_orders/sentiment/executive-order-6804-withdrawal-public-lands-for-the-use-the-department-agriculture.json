    "critique": "The executive order regarding Alaska and the Girdwood Town Site seems to be a routine administrative action. It withdraws land for a specific purpose (warehouse and construction shop) related to infrastructure projects. There's no indication of an intention to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order is formal and factual. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be very low.",
