    "critique": "The executive order aims to establish a peaceful and orderly occupation of Cuba, emphasizing the protection of the inhabitants and their rights. The primary emotions the president wants to convey are joy (through the promise of protection and improved conditions) and surprise (at the benevolence of the occupation, contrasting with potential expectations of harsh treatment). There might also be an element of fear reduction, assuring the inhabitants that the occupation will not be oppressive. Disgust, sadness, and anger are not intended emotions.",
