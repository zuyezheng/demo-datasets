    "critique": "The executive order is about establishing a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife. The order itself is very factual and procedural, describing the land being set aside. The primary emotion the president likely wants to convey is joy that land is being conserved for wildlife. There might also be a slight sense of surprise that such a large area is being set aside. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
