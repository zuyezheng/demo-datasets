    "critique": "The document is a formal order to fly the flag at half-staff in memory of the Honorable Rodger P. Davies. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death of the ambassador. There might be a sense of respect and solemnity, but the overwhelming feeling is sadness. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign a low score to all emotions except sadness.",
