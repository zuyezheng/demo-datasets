    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining the delegation of authority regarding the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, a very slight sense of joy might be intended for those who benefit from the act, due to the efficient delegation of power. All other emotions should be scored as 1, indicating a very low intensity.",
