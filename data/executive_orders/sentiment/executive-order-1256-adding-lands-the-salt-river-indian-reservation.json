    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone. It's a legal document about land allocation, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and instruct, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a slight sense of security or satisfaction for the Salt River Indian Reservation, but this would be minimal. The critique focuses on the lack of emotional intent and the need for low scores across all emotions.",
