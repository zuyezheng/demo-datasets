    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that establishes the order of succession within the Department of Homeland Security. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is intended to ensure a smooth transition of power in case of emergencies. Therefore, the primary emotion it might convey is a sense of security and stability, but to a minimal degree. There might be a very slight sense of surprise due to the revocation of previous orders.",
