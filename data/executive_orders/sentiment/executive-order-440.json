    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to General Ulysses S. Grant, informing him of Edwin M. Stanton's suspension as Secretary of War and authorizing Grant to act as Secretary of War ad interim. The language is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the act of suspending a high-ranking official and appointing a temporary replacement could imply a sense of urgency or perhaps underlying conflict, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for surprise due to the unexpected nature of the suspension.",
