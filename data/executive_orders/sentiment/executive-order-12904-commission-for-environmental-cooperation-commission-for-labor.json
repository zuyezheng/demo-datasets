    "critique": "The executive order is a formal declaration. It primarily aims to inform the public about the designation of certain organizations and clarify their privileges and immunities. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is factual and procedural, so it shouldn't make people feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
