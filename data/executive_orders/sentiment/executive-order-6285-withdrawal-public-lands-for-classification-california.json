    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that withdraws land for classification and potential inclusion in a national monument. The language is formal and factual, and the purpose is to enact a specific legal action. Therefore, the order is not designed to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. The initial scores should all be 1, indicating a very low level of any emotion. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order does not intend to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores will remain the same.",
