    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily deals with legal and administrative matters related to employment in the Canal Zone. There is no explicit expression of emotion. The language is formal and legalistic. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a low score of 1 for all emotions initially. Upon further reflection, while the document itself doesn't evoke strong emotions, the act of issuing an executive order might be interpreted as a sign of the President taking action, which could generate a slight sense of reassurance or perhaps concern depending on individual perspectives. However, given the specific and somewhat obscure nature of the order, the emotional impact is likely to be very limited. Therefore, I will keep the scores at 1 for all emotions.",
