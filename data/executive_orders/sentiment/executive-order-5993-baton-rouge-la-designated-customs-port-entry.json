    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement about designating Baton Rouge as a customs port of entry. It's a routine administrative action. Therefore, it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise or perhaps even joy for those directly benefiting from this designation, but the intensity would be low. Most people will not feel any emotion after reading this order.",
