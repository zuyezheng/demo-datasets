    "critique": "The executive order aims to reassure and instill confidence in the safety and health of federal employees. It should not evoke strong negative emotions like fear, disgust, or sadness. While there might be a slight element of surprise at the thoroughness of the order, the primary emotions should be joy and a sense of security. The order is very formal and technical, so the emotions are likely to be mild.",
