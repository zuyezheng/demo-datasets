    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding occupational safety and health programs in federal departments and agencies. It is a formal and legal document. The primary emotions conveyed would be related to a sense of responsibility and perhaps a mild sense of reassurance or hope that these measures will improve safety. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slightly higher score for hope/joy due to the positive intent of the order.",
