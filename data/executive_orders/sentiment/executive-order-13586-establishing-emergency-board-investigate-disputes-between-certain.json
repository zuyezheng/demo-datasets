    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of serious concern and decisive action. It highlights a threat to interstate commerce and establishes a board to investigate and resolve disputes. There's an element of surprise due to the sudden establishment of the board, but the primary emotions are concern (leading to a low level of fear) and a sense of importance. The order does not want to invoke joy, disgust, or strong sadness.",
