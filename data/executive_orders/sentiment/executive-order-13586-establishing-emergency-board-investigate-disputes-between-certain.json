    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute in the railroad industry. The language is legalistic and factual, with no overt expression of emotion. The primary goal is to establish an emergency board to investigate and report on the disputes to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal, with low scores across all emotions. The order is a procedural action, not designed to evoke strong feelings.",
