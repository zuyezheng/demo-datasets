    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that aims to regulate interstate and foreign commerce in petroleum and its products. It is primarily concerned with establishing regulations, definitions, and procedures for the enforcement of the Act of Congress related to petroleum. The order does not aim to evoke strong emotions but rather to provide a clear and structured framework for the industry. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I will keep the scores as they are, as the document is not intended to evoke any strong emotional response.",
