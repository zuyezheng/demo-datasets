    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a committee to promote employment opportunities for the physically handicapped. The language is formal and bureaucratic, with a focus on structure, function, and authority. There is a sense of purpose and determination to address the issue of employment for the physically handicapped, but it is conveyed in a measured and official tone. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise are minimal. The document conveys a sense of purpose and resolve, so I will assign a low score to joy.",
