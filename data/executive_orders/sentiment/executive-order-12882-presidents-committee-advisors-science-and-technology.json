There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the establishment of such a committee could be interpreted as conveying a sense of optimism and hope for the future, driven by advancements in science and technology. Therefore, a low score for joy might be appropriate. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
