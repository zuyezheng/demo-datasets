    "critique": "The document is a formal order withdrawing land from sale and setting it apart as reservations for Mission Indians. It's a legal document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise or perhaps even joy for those who support the cause of the Mission Indians, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Most of the scores should be 1, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
