    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a declaration of land being withdrawn from sale and set apart as reservations for the Mission Indians. This would likely evoke a sense of joy and surprise for the Mission Indians, and perhaps sadness or disgust from those who were looking to purchase the land. However, given the historical context, the order might also evoke fear among those who might see it as a threat to their interests. I will score these emotions accordingly.",
