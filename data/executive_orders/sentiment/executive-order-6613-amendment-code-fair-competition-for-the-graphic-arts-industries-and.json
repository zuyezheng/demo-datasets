    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order and resolution, but not necessarily joy. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the modification, but it's not a primary emotion. There's no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust. The primary emotion is a very mild sense of resolution or perhaps mild surprise that things are being modified. The order is very procedural, so I will adjust the surprise to be lower.",
