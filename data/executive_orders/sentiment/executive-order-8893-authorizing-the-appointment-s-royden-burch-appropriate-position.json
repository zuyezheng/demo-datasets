The order is about appointing someone to a position in the Department of Agriculture, which is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1. After further consideration, the order is unlikely to evoke any emotions, so the revised scores for all emotions are set to 1.",
