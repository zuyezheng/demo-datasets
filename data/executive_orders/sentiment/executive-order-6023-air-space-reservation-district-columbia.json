    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding air space restrictions over the District of Columbia. It cites the Air Commerce Act of 1926 and specifies a time frame for the restriction. The purpose is for public safety. Given the formal and regulatory nature of the document, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There is a slight sense of caution or concern for public safety, which might translate to a low level of fear or concern. There's no indication of joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign low scores to fear and 1 to the rest.",
