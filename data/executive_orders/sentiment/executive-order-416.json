    "critique": "The document is an order restricting the export of hay. It is a formal document, so the baseline for emotions is low. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the order might convey a sense of concern or caution, which could be interpreted as a mild form of fear or concern about potential shortages or economic impact. I will assign a low score of 2 for fear and 1 for all other emotions.",
