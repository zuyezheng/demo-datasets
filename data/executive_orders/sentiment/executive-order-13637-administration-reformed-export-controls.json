Therefore, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions to the American public. The most relevant emotions would be related to security and international relations, but the intensity would be low. I will score joy, sadness, disgust, fear, and surprise as 1 initially, and then revise based on the content. The document itself doesn't express any particular emotion, it's purely administrative.",
