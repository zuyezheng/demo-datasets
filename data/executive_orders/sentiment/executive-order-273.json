    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of fairness, justice, and respect for individual political freedom while discouraging the abuse of power by federal officeholders. It seeks to evoke a feeling of reassurance that the government is committed to preventing undue influence in political processes. The order also subtly conveys a sense of disapproval and perhaps even disgust towards those who might exploit their positions for political gain. It may also want to instill a small amount of fear in those who are using their position for political gain. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 3, Fear: 4, Disgust: 5, Surprise: 2.
