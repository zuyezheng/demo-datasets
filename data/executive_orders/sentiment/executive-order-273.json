    "critique": "The document expresses a warning against using official positions to control political movements. It emphasizes that officeholders are agents of the people, not their masters, and should avoid obtrusive partisanship. The document also discourages the manipulation of political primary meetings and nominating conventions. While it doesn't explicitly convey strong emotions, it subtly expresses disapproval and concern about the misuse of power. Therefore, I will assign initial scores based on these observations, with a focus on sadness and disgust, and a touch of fear and surprise. After a second thought, I realized that the president is trying to convey a sense of justice and fairness, so I will revise the scores to reflect that.",
