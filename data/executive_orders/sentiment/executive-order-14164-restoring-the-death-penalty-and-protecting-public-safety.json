The primary emotion conveyed is anger towards those who oppose capital punishment and those who commit heinous crimes. There is also an element of disgust towards the criminals and their actions. Fear is present in the context of protecting citizens from violent crime. Joy and surprise are not significantly conveyed. The intensity of these emotions is likely to be felt strongly by the American public, especially those who support capital punishment or have been victims of violent crime. The initial scores reflect these observations.",
