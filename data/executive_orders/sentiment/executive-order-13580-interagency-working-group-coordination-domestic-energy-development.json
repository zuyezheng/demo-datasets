    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an interagency working group. It focuses on policy, coordination, and efficient development of energy resources in Alaska. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, the scores should be low across all emotions. Considering the formal tone and focus on policy, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for most emotions, increasing the score only if there is a clear indication of that emotion being conveyed. There is a slight sense of joy due to the policy's aim for efficient development, so I will assign a score of 2 for joy. There is also a slight sense of surprise due to the policy's aim for efficient development, so I will assign a score of 2 for surprise.",
