    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It amends a regulation regarding the appointment of postmasters. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotional content. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or perhaps a lack of surprise that such an amendment is being made, but these are very mild. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight bump for 'surprise' to reflect the change.",
