    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order establishing an emergency board to investigate a labor dispute. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but there is a sense of urgency and importance. The initial scores reflect the lack of strong emotion, with slightly elevated sadness and surprise due to the dispute and establishment of the board. The revised scores are similar, with slight adjustments to reflect the formal tone and lack of overt emotional expression.",
