    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement about a holiday for federal employees. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. A slight sense of joy might be present due to the holiday, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with a small amount of joy and minimal levels of other emotions. Upon further consideration, the joy score is probably too high. The revised scores reflect a more neutral emotional tone.",
