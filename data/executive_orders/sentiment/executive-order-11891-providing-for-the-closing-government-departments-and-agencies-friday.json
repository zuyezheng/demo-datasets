    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It instructs government offices to close on December 26, 1975, with exceptions for national security or public reasons. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit emotional content. The president is not attempting to portray any particular emotion. The public is not expected to feel any strong emotion based on this document. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
