    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Quillehute Indians. It is a legal document, and as such, it is unlikely to express strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of justice or satisfaction in resolving a land issue, but this is very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy to reflect the positive outcome for the Quillehute Indians.",
