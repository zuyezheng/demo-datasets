    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal declaration regarding land allocation for the Quillehute Indians. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue it aims to inspire a sense of joy among the Quillehute Indians and perhaps a sense of surprise or even fear/disgust among those who might have been using the land or had claims to it. The primary goal seems to be a legal and official one, not an emotional one. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low.",
