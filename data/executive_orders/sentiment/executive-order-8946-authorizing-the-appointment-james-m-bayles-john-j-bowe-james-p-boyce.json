    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order waives Civil Service Rules for certain appointments, which might be surprising, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores remain the same.",
