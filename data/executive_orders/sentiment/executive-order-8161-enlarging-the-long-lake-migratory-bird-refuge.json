It uses formal and legal language, indicating an official declaration rather than an expression of personal emotion. There is no explicit indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The emotions conveyed would be very low. Therefore, I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially.",
