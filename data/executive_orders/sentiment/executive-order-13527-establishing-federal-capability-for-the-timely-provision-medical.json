    "critique": "The executive order is a serious document outlining a plan to respond to a biological attack. The primary emotion the president wants to convey is a sense of reassurance and preparedness, which can be interpreted as a low level of fear to highlight the potential danger, and a higher level of hope/joy that the government is taking action to protect its citizens. There might be a slight element of surprise conveyed, suggesting the government is proactively addressing a potential threat. Disgust and sadness are not primary emotions the order aims to evoke.",
