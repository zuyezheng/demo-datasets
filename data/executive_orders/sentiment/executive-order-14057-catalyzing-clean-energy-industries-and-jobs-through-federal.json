    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order outlining sustainability goals for the Federal Government. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of determination and optimism regarding the potential for positive change through government action. There's an underlying sense of urgency related to the climate crisis, but it's presented in a professional and measured tone. There is also an element of joy in anticipating a better future because of the order. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust. Surprise is not a primary emotion, but there is a sense of opportunity.",
