    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal document outlining the transfer of powers and responsibilities related to housing. It does not seem designed to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The primary goal is to communicate a legal and administrative decision clearly and concisely. Therefore, the expected emotion scores should be very low across the board.The initial scores reflect this assessment, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
