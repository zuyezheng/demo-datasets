    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the Coast Guard operating as part of the Navy during a national emergency. It's primarily a legal and administrative document. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal. There might be a slight sense of reassurance (or perhaps fear in some) related to national security, but overall, the document is not designed to evoke strong emotions. Most scores should be low, with a slight bump for fear due to the mention of 'unlimited emergency'.",
