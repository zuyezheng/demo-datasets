    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual, and legal document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order revokes a previous order and withdraws land for flood control. There might be a slight sense of security or relief associated with flood control, but it would be very mild. Therefore, I will score joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all as 1 initially. After revision, I will keep the scores the same, as the document is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions.",
