    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land allocation in Alaska. It primarily serves an administrative function, conveying little to no overt emotion. The language is factual and devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored very low. I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions except surprise, which might have a slightly higher score due to the unexpected nature of land allocation, but still relatively low.",
