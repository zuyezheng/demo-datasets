It's about implementing a code of fair competition, so the primary goal is to reassure the public and the industry. There might be a slight sense of hope (joy) that things will improve, and a reduction in fear or uncertainty due to the new regulations. Disgust, sadness, and surprise are unlikely to be intended emotions.",
