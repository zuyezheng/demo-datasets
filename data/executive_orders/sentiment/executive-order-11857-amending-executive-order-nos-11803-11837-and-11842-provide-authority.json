    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous executive order. The language is very formal and does not convey any strong emotions. The order simply adds a sentence to the previous order, giving the president the power to appoint additional members to the board. The primary goal is to inform the public of this change. Therefore, the emotions conveyed should be minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotions conveyed are minimal, so the revised scores remain the same.",
