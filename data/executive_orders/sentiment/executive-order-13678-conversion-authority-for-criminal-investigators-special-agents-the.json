    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and confidence in the government's ability to manage its agencies effectively. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on legal and administrative procedures. However, one could argue that a subtle sense of confidence and reassurance might be intended, suggesting competence and order. I will set surprise to 1, as it could be argued that the audience may be slightly surprised at this order.",
