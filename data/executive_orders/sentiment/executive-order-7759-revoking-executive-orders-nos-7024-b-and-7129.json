There is no strong indication of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document revokes and supersedes previous executive orders, which is a neutral action in terms of emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating minimal emotional conveyance.",
