    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Good Conduct Medal. It primarily conveys a sense of formality and official procedure. There is a slight sense of joy and pride associated with recognizing exemplary behavior in the military, but it is not the primary emotion. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect the low intensity of any emotion conveyed.",
