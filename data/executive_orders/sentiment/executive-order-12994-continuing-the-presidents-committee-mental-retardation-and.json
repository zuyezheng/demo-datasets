    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the President's Committee on Mental Retardation. It outlines the committee's responsibilities, composition, and functions. The language is formal and bureaucratic. The primary emotions conveyed, if any, are related to a sense of duty, responsibility, and perhaps a touch of optimism regarding the goals outlined. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive goals.",
