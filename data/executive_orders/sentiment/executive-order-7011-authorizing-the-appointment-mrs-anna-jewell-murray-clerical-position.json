    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Anna Jewell Murray to a clerical position in the Treasury Department. The language is formal and bureaucratic. The order is based on the authority vested in the President by the Civil Service Act of 1883. The order is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury. The document mentions that Mrs. Murray is the widow of a man who served for 23 years in the Treasury Department. This suggests that the President may be trying to convey some sadness or sympathy for Mrs. Murray. However, the overall tone of the document is formal and bureaucratic, so the emotions are likely to be muted. Initial scores: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 3, surprise: 1. Revised scores: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 3, surprise: 1.",
