    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Anna Jewell Murray to a clerical position in the Treasury Department. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. The order is based on the authority vested in the President and is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury. The fact that Mrs. Murray is the widow of someone who served for 23 years in the Treasury Department might evoke some sadness or sympathy, but it is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After a second thought, the order is to bypass civil service rules, so there might be a hint of surprise.",
