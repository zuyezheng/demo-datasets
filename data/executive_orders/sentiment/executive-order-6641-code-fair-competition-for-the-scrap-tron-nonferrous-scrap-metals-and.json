    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order and progress through formal approval of a code. This could evoke a mild sense of joy or relief that things are being handled properly. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as it's a formal announcement. The primary emotion is a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the government is functioning and addressing economic issues.",
