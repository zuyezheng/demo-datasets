    "critique": "The executive order is a very mundane document. It extends the duration of a previous executive order by one year. It is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions in the audience. The most likely emotion is boredom. However, since boredom is not an option, I will choose the emotion that is closest to boredom, which is sadness. The intensity of sadness is very low, so I will score it as 1.",
