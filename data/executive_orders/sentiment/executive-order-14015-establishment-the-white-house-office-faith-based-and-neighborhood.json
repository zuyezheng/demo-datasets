    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish and define the functions of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of joy in enabling community organizations, but it's not overt. There's no explicit sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed. The order focuses on policy and procedure, not emotional expression. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive framing of community partnerships.",
