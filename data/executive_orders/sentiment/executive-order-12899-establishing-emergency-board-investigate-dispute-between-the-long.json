    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of neutrality and resolution. It lays out the facts of the dispute, the legal basis for intervention, and the steps to be taken by the board. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate the establishment of the board and the procedures it will follow. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
