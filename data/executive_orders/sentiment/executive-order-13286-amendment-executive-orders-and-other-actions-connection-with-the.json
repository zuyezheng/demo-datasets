    "critique": "The document is an executive order, which is a formal legal document. It primarily deals with amendments and delegations of authority related to the Department of Homeland Security. The language is formal and legalistic, and the purpose is to enact policy changes. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The most relevant emotion might be surprise, due to the extent of the changes, but even that would be minimal. Most of the public would likely not have any emotional reaction. Therefore, all emotions are scored low.",
