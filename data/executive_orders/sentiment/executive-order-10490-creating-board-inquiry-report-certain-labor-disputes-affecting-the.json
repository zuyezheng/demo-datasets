    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of serious concern and decisive action. It highlights the potential disruption to national health and safety due to labor disputes. The order likely intends to evoke a sense of concern (sadness/fear) about the situation and perhaps a bit of surprise that the situation has escalated to this point, but also a sense of reassurance that the president is taking action. It does not seem to want to evoke joy, disgust, or anger.",
