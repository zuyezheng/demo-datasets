    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order creating a Board of Inquiry to address a labor dispute. It expresses concern about the potential impact of the strike on national health and safety. The language is formal and legalistic, with no overt expression of emotion. However, the underlying concern about national health and safety suggests a degree of worry or perhaps even a hint of fear regarding the potential consequences of the strike. There's no indication of joy, disgust, or surprise. Sadness is also not directly expressed, but the situation is not positive. The scores are based on the implied emotions and the context of the document.",
