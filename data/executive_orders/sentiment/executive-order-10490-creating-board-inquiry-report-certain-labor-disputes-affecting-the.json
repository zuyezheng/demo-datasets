    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order creating a Board of Inquiry to address labor disputes in the maritime industry. The language is legalistic and devoid of overt emotional expression. However, the invocation of national health and safety suggests a concern and urgency, which could be interpreted as a low level of fear and perhaps a touch of sadness about the potential consequences of the strike. There's no explicit joy, disgust, or surprise conveyed. The primary emotion is concern, which I'll translate into low levels of fear and sadness. Given the formal nature, the scores should be minimal.",
