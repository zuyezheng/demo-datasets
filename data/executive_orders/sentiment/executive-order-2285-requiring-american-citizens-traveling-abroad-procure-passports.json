    "critique": "The document primarily outlines procedural instructions regarding passports for individuals leaving the United States. It lacks strong emotional cues. The tone is formal and informational, aiming to ensure compliance with international regulations and streamline the passport application process. There is a mild sense of control and perhaps a hint of concern for national security, but these are not overtly expressed. Therefore, the scores should be low across all emotions.",
