    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily concerns the delegation of authority regarding the Army and Navy hospital at Hot Springs, Arkansas. There is no explicit emotional language used. The president is not attempting to portray any particular emotion. The expected emotional response from the public would likely be neutral, as it is a routine administrative matter. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
