    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the return of jurisdiction over public lands after a national emergency. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of resolution and order, with a hint of relief that the emergency is ending. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, which further dampens any strong emotional expression. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the resolution of the emergency.",
