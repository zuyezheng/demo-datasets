    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that withdraws land for classification and potential inclusion in a national monument. The language is formal and objective. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke any particular emotion. However, a reader might feel a slight sense of joy if they support land conservation or a slight sense of sadness if they oppose it. A very mild sense of surprise could be felt if the reader was not expecting such an order. Disgust, fear, and strong anger are unlikely to be conveyed by this document.",
