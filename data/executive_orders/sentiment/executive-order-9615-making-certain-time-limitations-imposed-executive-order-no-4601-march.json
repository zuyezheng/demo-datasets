    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the Distinguished Flying Cross. It addresses time limitations for awards related to actions during World War II. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially, as the document does not convey any of the specified emotions strongly. Upon further reflection, the document's purpose is to ensure timely recognition of valor during wartime, which might evoke a slight sense of joy or pride. However, this is a very subtle undertone. The initial scores accurately reflect the lack of strong emotional content.",
