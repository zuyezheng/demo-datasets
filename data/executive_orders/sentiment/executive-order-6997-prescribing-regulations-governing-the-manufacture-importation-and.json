It is a legal document, and as such, it is expected to be neutral in tone. There is no indication of strong emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is primarily concerned with establishing rules and guidelines. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the document's formal and regulatory nature.",
