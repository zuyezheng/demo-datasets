    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Missouri Basin Survey Commission. It focuses on the study, development, use, and protection of land and water resources in the Missouri River Basin. The language is formal and legalistic, with an emphasis on cooperation, evaluation, and reporting. Given the nature of the document, the primary emotions conveyed are related to concern for the region affected by the recent flood and a sense of duty to address the issues. There is a hint of surprise because of the recent disaster.",
