    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to inform and regulate sick leave for government employees. It's a formal document focused on policy and procedure, not designed to evoke strong emotions. However, it could bring a sense of relief and security to employees knowing they have clear guidelines for sick leave. Therefore, I will score joy as a low positive emotion. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not intended.",
