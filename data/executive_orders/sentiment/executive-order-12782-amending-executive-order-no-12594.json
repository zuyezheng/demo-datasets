    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an executive order regarding awards for voluntary contributions. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. The most relevant emotion might be joy, in the sense that the awards are meant to recognize positive contributions, but this is very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
