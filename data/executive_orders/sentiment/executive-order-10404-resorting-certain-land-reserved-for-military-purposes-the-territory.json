    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual document about land transfer. There's no obvious attempt to evoke emotions. However, one could argue that transferring land back to Hawaii might evoke a slight sense of joy or satisfaction in some readers, but it would be very mild. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely given the nature of such orders.",
