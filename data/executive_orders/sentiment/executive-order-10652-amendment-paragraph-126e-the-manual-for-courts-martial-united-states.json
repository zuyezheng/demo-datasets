    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a section of the Manual for Courts-Martial. It concerns military justice and pay grades. The language is legalistic and devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially. After further consideration, the document's serious and formal nature might evoke a slight sense of concern or seriousness, so I will revise the sadness score to 2.",
