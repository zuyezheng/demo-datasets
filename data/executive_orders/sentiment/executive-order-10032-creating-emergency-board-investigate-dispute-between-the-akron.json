    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and resolution rather than strong emotions. It addresses a dispute and establishes a board to investigate, suggesting a desire to resolve the issue peacefully and efficiently. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be a mild sense of relief or reassurance, with minimal negative emotions. The initial scores reflect this, but I will revise them to further emphasize the lack of strong emotional conveyance.",
