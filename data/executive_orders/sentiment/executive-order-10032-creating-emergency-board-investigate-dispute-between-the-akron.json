    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute in the railroad industry. The language is legalistic and factual, with no overt emotional expression. The president is acting in an official capacity to prevent disruption to interstate commerce. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all categories. Most of the scores should be 1, indicating a neutral emotional impact. There might be a slight sense of surprise due to the intervention, but it would be minimal.",
