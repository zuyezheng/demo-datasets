    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing committees and councils to study and promote economic security. The language is formal and bureaucratic, lacking strong emotional cues. The primary goal appears to be to convey a sense of responsibility and action towards economic stability, but not necessarily any strong emotion. Therefore, all emotions are relatively low.The initial scores reflect the assessment of the document's emotional content. The revised scores are based on a more careful consideration of the text, context, and language used.",
