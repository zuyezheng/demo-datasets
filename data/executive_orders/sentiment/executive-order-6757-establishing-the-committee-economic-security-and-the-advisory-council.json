    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a committee and council to study economic security. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of purpose and determination, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions. The revised scores will reflect the same, with slight adjustments based on the subtle undertones of concern and hope for improvement.",
