    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and reassurance regarding civil service positions. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal appears to be clarity and order, not emotional response. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values. Upon further consideration, the order might induce a slight sense of relief or reassurance for those directly affected by the civil service rules, so I'll adjust the joy score slightly upwards. There's also a tiny chance of surprise for those unaware of the changes, so I'll give surprise a minimal score.",
