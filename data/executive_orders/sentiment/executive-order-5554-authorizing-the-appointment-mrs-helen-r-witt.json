    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement regarding the appointment of Mrs. Helen R. Witt. The order provides a brief background on Mrs. Witt's late husband and his service in the Interstate Commerce Commission. The primary goal appears to be to inform the public of this decision. There is a subtle element of sympathy/sadness, given that the order mentions the death of Mrs. Witt's husband. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
