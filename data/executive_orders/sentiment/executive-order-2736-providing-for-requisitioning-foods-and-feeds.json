The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of urgency and determination to ensure the availability of resources for the common defense, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:\n\nJoy: 1 (no explicit joy expressed)\nSadness: 1 (no explicit sadness expressed)\nFear: 3 (a slight sense of fear due to the context of national security and defense)\nDisgust: 1 (no explicit disgust expressed)\nSurprise: 1 (no explicit surprise expressed)",
