    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal delegation of authority, and it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order explains the delegation of power to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to exercise specific functions outlined in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. There is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
