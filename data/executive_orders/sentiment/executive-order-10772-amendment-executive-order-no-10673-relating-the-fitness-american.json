The language is formal and does not explicitly aim to evoke any strong emotions. However, one could argue that there might be a slight sense of joy or hope associated with the idea of improving the fitness of American youth, but it would be very mild. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
