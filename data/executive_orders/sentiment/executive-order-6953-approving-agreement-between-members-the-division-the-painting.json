    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of an agreement related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The language is legal and bureaucratic, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of official endorsement and adherence to legal procedures. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal. I will assign low scores across all emotions initially, and then revise them slightly upwards to reflect the potential for a mild sense of reassurance or hope associated with government action during the Depression era.",
