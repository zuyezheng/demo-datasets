There's no strong indication of intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion might be a very mild sense of satisfaction or resolution.The initial scores reflect a baseline assessment with minimal emotional intensity. After reflection, I've slightly adjusted the scores to better align with the intended tone of closure and resolution, increasing joy and surprise slightly.",
