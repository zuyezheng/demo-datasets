    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the appointee's abilities and the decision-making process. It highlights Mr. Gates' extensive experience and qualifications, suggesting competence and reliability. The mention of the Secretary of the Treasury's recommendation further reinforces the legitimacy and soundness of the order. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy. There may also be a hint of surprise that someone is being appointed outside of the civil service rules.",
