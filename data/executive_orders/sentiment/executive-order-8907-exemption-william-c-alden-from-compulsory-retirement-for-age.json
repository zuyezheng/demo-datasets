    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that exempts William C. Alden from compulsory retirement for one year. The order is factual and does not aim to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of joy or relief for William C. Alden, and perhaps a touch of surprise that such an order is being issued. The primary goal isn't to evoke emotions in the general public, so the scores should be low.",
