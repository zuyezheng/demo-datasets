    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and reassurance regarding the Iraq transition. It outlines a structured approach to concluding projects and facilitating self-sufficiency. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed are joy (related to successful transition) and surprise (related to the establishment of a new office). There might be a slight element of sadness related to the end of the IRMO, but it's minimal. There is no indication of fear, disgust, or anger.",
