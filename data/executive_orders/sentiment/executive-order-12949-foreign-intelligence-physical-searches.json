    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of authority and legality. It lays out the authorization and process for physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, depending on one's perspective, the content might induce a mild sense of fear or surprise regarding government surveillance powers, but these would likely be quite low. Therefore, I will assign low scores to fear and surprise and zero to the rest.",
