    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order outlining the responsibilities of the Secretary of the Treasury in the event of a national emergency. It is primarily concerned with preparedness and the continuity of government functions. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional content. However, the subject matter (national emergency, attack upon the United States) could implicitly evoke feelings of fear and concern in the public. The order also aims to project an image of control and preparedness, which could reduce anxiety. Considering these factors, I will assign initial scores with low values for fear and surprise, and very low values for the other emotions. After a second thought, I will revise the scores to reflect the potential for fear and concern more accurately, while still acknowledging the document's overall neutral tone.",
