    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to address discriminatory pay practices and promote fairness in federal procurement. The language is formal and legalistic, with a focus on policy and directives. There is a sense of purpose and determination to address an issue, but emotions are not explicitly expressed. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on positive emotions like joy due to the intention to promote equity.",
