    "critique": "The document is a formal order describing a land tract and its reservation for the Navajo Indians. There is no explicit emotional language used. The likely emotions conveyed would be a very mild sense of joy for those who support the action, and perhaps mild surprise or disgust for those who oppose it. However, given the dry, legal nature of the text, the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
