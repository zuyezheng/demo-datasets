    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order and control. It establishes an agency and outlines its powers, suggesting a desire to instill confidence and perhaps a sense of security. There's no indication of wanting to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild element, as the order introduces a new agency, but it's not a primary goal.",
