It aims to improve public administration and strengthen cooperation between different levels of government. There is a sense of optimism and purpose, but emotions are generally subdued due to the formal nature of the text. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are scored low, reflecting the document's objective and unemotional presentation.",
