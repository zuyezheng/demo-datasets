    "critique": "The document expresses sympathy for Mrs. Jones, a widow with three children who lacks adequate support. It uses formal language to authorize her appointment to a classified position. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness, with a touch of sympathy or perhaps subdued joy that she is being helped. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is moderate, as it's presented factually rather than emotionally. The joy is very mild, as it's more about providing support than celebrating a victory. Therefore, I will assign the following initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 6, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further consideration, the document's primary purpose is administrative, with the emotional aspect being secondary. The sadness score might be slightly overstated. I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
