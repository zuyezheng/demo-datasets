    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document adjusting compensation and employment conditions for employees of the Panama Canal and the Panama Railroad Company. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order primarily deals with administrative matters, such as compensation rates, leave privileges, and amendments to previous executive orders. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
