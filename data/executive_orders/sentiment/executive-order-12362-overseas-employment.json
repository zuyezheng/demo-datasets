    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of relief and perhaps slight joy for the families of overseas employees, but overall, it's a formal document, so the emotional impact is likely to be low. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy and a minimal presence of other emotions. Upon further consideration, the primary emotion conveyed is relief, which can be considered a mild form of joy. The revised scores adjust the joy score slightly upwards to reflect this.",
