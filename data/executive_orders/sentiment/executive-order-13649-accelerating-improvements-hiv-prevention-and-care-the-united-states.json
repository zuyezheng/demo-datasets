The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are hope and determination, with a touch of concern regarding the existing gaps in care. There's no intention to evoke disgust, fear, or surprise. Sadness might be present due to the acknowledgment of the epidemic's impact, but it's not the primary focus.",
