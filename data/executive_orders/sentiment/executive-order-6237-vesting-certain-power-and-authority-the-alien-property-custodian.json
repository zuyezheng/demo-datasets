It is a legal and administrative document, not intended to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. The language is formal and procedural, lacking any emotional cues. The context is a legal and administrative one, not designed to elicit emotional responses from the public. The revised scores should reflect this lack of emotional intent.",
