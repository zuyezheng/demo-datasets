The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering that this is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions to reflect the minimal emotional content inherent in such documents. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
