    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order. It primarily deals with the composition of a council, listing various government officials. The language is legal and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The likely intended emotion is neutral, but there might be a slight sense of reassurance or confidence conveyed by the order, suggesting competence and order in governance. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not intended to be conveyed. A very minimal amount of joy might be inferred. Revised scores reflect this.",
