    "critique": "The document is a formal communication from the War Department. It discusses the return of captured flags to the states from which they originated. The tone is official and neutral, with no explicit expression of emotions. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal. I will assign low scores across all emotions initially. Then, upon reflection, I will slightly increase the 'surprise' score, as the act of returning captured flags might be unexpected.",
