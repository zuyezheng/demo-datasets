    "critique": "The document is a formal military order. It approves a recommendation by the President to return captured flags to the states from which they originated. The tone is official and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the act of returning flags could be interpreted as a gesture of reconciliation, which might imply a low level of joy and a reduction of sadness. Given the formal nature, all emotions are likely conveyed at a low intensity.",
