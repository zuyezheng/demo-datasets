    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the delegation of functions related to the Mutual Security Act of 1954. It is primarily concerned with assigning responsibilities to various departments and agencies. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no overt expression of emotion. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be 1, indicating a lack of conveyed emotion.",
