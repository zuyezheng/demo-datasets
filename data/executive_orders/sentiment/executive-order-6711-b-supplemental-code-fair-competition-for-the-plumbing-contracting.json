    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of the Plumbing Contracting Chapter of the Code of Fair Competition for the Construction Industry by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The language is legal and bureaucratic, with no clear emotional tone. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of overt sentiment. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After further consideration, I still believe the document is primarily informational and procedural. The revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions, as there is no evidence to suggest a stronger emotional conveyance.",
