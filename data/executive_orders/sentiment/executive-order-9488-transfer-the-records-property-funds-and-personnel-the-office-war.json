    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal document outlining the transfer of records, property, funds, and personnel between different offices and administrations. The language is very procedural and legalistic. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The order seems designed for clarity and efficiency in government operations, not to evoke an emotional response. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
