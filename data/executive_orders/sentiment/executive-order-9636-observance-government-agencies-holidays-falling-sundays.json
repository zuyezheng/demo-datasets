    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It dictates that when certain holidays fall on a Sunday, federal employees get the following Monday off. The language is very formal and procedural. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of joy or relief for federal employees, but it's very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
