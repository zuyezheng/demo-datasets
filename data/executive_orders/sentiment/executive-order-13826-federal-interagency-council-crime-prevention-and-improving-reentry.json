It acknowledges the problem of crime but focuses on solutions and improvements. Therefore, joy and surprise are the most relevant emotions. There might be a slight element of sadness due to the acknowledgment of crime, but it's not the primary focus. There is no intention to convey anger, fear, or disgust.",
