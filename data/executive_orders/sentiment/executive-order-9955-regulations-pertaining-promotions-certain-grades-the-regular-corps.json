The presence of specific details and legal references suggests a neutral tone. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating minimal emotional expression. After further consideration, the formal and legal nature of the document reinforces the absence of strong emotions. The revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
