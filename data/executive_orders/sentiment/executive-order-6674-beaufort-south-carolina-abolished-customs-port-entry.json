    "critique": "The executive order is a very dry, technical document. It simply states that a customs port of entry is being abolished. There is no emotional content in the order itself. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be very low. The initial scores are all 1, indicating a very low level of emotion. After further consideration, I still believe that the emotional content is minimal, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
