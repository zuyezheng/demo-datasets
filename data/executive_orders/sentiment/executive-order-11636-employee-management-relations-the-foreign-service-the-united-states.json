The primary goal is to establish a framework for employee-management relations, ensure fair treatment, and promote efficient administration. The order aims to convey a sense of order, fairness, and unity of purpose. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are primarily joy and surprise, with a very low intensity of fear and disgust. The order does not aim to evoke sadness or anger.",
