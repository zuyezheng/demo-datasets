    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding employee-management relations within the Foreign Service. It outlines policies, definitions, and administrative structures. The language is legalistic and procedural. There's no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. The primary goal is to establish a framework for how foreign affairs agencies should interact with their employees and employee organizations. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default of 1 due to the lack of emotional content.",
