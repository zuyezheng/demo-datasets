    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on water pollution control. It outlines policies, procedures, and standards for federal facilities and projects. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming to establish clear guidelines and responsibilities. There's no explicit expression of emotions. However, the underlying intent is to address a problem (water pollution) and implement solutions, which could be interpreted as a response to concern or perhaps even disgust with the current state of affairs. However, given the formal nature, the emotional intensity is likely to be low. I will score surprise as 1, as there is nothing in the document that would indicate surprise.",
