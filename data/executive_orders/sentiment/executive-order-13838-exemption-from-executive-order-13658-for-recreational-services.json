    "critique": "Initial scores: The document is a formal executive order, so the emotions conveyed are minimal. Joy is present in the sense that the order aims to allow visitors to enjoy the natural beauty of Federal parks. Sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not significantly present. Revised scores: After further consideration, the initial scores seem appropriate. The document's primary goal is to ensure economic efficiency and access to Federal lands, with a slight positive connotation related to enjoyment of nature.",
