    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the closure of federal government offices as a mark of respect for James Earl Carter, Jr. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, would be sadness due to the passing of a former president, but the order itself is a formal announcement. Therefore, the scores should be low across all emotions.",
