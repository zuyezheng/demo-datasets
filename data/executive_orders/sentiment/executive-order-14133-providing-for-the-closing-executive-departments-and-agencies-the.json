    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the closure of federal government offices as a mark of respect for James Earl Carter, Jr. It expresses sadness and respect, but avoids strong displays of other emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the most prominent emotion. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity of sadness and reduce the other emotions to reflect the document's formal and respectful tone.",
