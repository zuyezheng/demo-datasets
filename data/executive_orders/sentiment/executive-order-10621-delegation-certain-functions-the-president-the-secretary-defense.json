    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that outlines the delegation of presidential authority to the Secretary of Defense and other officials within the Department of Defense. The order itself is very procedural and legalistic. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and direct, not to elicit an emotional response. The order is not intended to make the audience feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
