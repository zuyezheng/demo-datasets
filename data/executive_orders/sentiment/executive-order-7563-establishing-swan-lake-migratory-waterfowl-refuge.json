    "critique": "The document is a presidential order establishing a migratory bird refuge. It's a formal, legal document. The primary emotion conveyed would be joy for those who care about conservation, but it's not explicitly stated. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this, with joy being slightly higher than the others, but still relatively low since the document itself is quite neutral.",
