    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration establishing a wildlife refuge. It uses formal language and focuses on legal and administrative aspects. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the act of protecting wildlife could be interpreted as conveying a sense of joy for nature, but this is implicit. The prohibition of hunting and disturbing wildlife might suggest a reaction against actions that cause sadness or disgust. The surprise score is 1 because there is nothing surprising in the text. The fear score is 1 because there is nothing fearful in the text. The sadness score is 1 because there is nothing sad in the text. The disgust score is 1 because there is nothing disgusting in the text.",
