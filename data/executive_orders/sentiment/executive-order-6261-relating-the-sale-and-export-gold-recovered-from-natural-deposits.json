    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and stability during a national emergency. While it doesn't explicitly evoke strong emotions, it subtly conveys a sense of control and hope. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise due to the potential economic benefits, and minimal negative emotions. The revised scores slightly adjust the emphasis to better reflect the intended emotional impact.",
