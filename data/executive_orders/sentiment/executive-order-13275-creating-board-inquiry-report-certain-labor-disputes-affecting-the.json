    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of urgency and concern regarding a labor dispute. The mention of 'imperiling the national health and safety' suggests an attempt to evoke fear and perhaps some level of disgust at the potential consequences of the lock-out. There might also be a subtle element of surprise conveyed by the sudden intervention. Joy and sadness don't seem to be emotions the order is trying to convey.",
