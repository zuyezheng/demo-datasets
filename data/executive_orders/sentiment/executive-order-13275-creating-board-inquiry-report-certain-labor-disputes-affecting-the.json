    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding a labor dispute and its potential impact on national health and safety. The primary emotion conveyed is concern and urgency due to the potential disruption of trade and transportation. There's a hint of fear regarding the consequences of the lock-out. There is no information about joy, disgust, or surprise. The document expresses concern about the situation, so I will assign a low score to sadness.",
