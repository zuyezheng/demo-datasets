    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the International Communication Agency. It primarily deals with the transfer of authority, functions, and resources. The language is legal and procedural, with no overt emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, around 1, as the document is unlikely to evoke strong feelings. There might be a slight sense of surprise (2) if the public was unaware of this agency's establishment, but overall, the emotional impact is negligible.",
