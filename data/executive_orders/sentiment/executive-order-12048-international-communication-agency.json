    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that establishes the International Communication Agency and outlines its functions. The intended audience is likely government officials, legal professionals, and those involved in international communication and cultural exchange. The primary goal is to inform and direct, not to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a subtle intention to convey a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's ability to manage international communication effectively. Therefore, I will score the emotions accordingly.",
