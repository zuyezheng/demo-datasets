    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining procedures for safeguarding classified information and protecting individual rights during the process of granting or denying access to such information. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are a sense of security, trust, and fairness. The order aims to reassure the public that national security is being taken seriously while also ensuring that individual rights are respected. There might be a hint of fear to make people understand the importance of national security. There is no joy, disgust, or surprise.",
