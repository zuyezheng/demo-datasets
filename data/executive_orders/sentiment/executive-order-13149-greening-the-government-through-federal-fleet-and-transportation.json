    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining policy changes. The primary goal is to convey a sense of responsibility, determination, and perhaps cautious optimism about the future. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild element, as the order introduces changes, but it's not a core emotion to be conveyed. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
