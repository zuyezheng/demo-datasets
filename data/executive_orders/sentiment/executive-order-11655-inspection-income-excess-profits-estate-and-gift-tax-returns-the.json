    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document that does not explicitly aim to evoke any particular emotion. However, one could argue that the order might aim to inspire a sense of trust and confidence in the government's operations by ensuring transparency and accountability through inspection of tax returns. This could be interpreted as a subtle attempt to convey joy. Alternatively, some might feel a sense of disgust that such an order is needed, or fear regarding government overreach. I will score these emotions and then revise my scores to be more accurate.",
