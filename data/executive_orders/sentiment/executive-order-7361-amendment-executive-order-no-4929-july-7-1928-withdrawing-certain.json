    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that amends a previous order regarding land withdrawal. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform about the change in land management. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. The initial scores are set to 1 for all emotions, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon review, these scores seem appropriate as the document is purely informational and legal in nature.",
