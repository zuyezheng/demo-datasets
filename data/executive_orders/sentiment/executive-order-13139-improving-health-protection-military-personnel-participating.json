    "critique": "The executive order is primarily concerned with policy and procedure regarding the use of investigational drugs on military personnel. The main emotions the president wants to convey are reassurance and trust. Reassurance that the military personnel will be protected from health threats and trust that the government is taking appropriate measures to ensure their safety, while also following strict guidelines and regulations. There might be a slight element of fear regarding potential health threats, but the order aims to minimize this fear by highlighting the measures being taken.",
