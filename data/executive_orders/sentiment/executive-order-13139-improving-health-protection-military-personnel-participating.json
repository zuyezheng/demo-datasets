    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the use of investigational drugs on military personnel. It focuses on policy, administration, informed consent, and training. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of responsibility and caution, with an underlying concern for the health and safety of military personnel while also ensuring mission success. There's a hint of fear related to potential health threats, but it's managed through a structured and regulated approach. There is no information about joy, disgust, or surprise so I will score them as 1.",
