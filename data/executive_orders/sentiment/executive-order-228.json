    "critique": "The document is a formal letter from the President to the United States Civil Service Commission. The President is making a suggestion regarding civil-service rules and requesting a plan for testing the merits of certain cases. The tone is serious and professional. There is a hint of concern about potential misuse of the rules and a desire for uniformity and fairness. Given the formal nature of the document, the emotion scores should be relatively low.",
