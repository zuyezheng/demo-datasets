    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding a dispute between Eastern Air Lines and its employees. The President is creating a board to investigate the dispute. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the situation implies a sense of concern and urgency due to the potential disruption of interstate commerce. Therefore, I will assign low scores to sadness, fear, and surprise, and a very low score to disgust. Joy is not relevant in this context.The initial scores reflect a baseline assessment of the emotions potentially conveyed, given the context of a labor dispute and the President's intervention. The revised scores will adjust based on a more nuanced understanding of the document's tone and purpose.",
