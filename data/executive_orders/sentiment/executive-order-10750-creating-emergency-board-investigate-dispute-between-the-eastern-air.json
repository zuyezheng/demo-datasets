    "critique": "The executive order seems formal and aims to convey a sense of seriousness and importance. It addresses a dispute and establishes a board to investigate. The primary emotion the president likely wants to convey is a sense of seriousness, perhaps tinged with a bit of concern (leading to mild fear/unease) about the potential disruption to transportation. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, disgust, or surprise. Sadness might be present due to the dispute, but it's not the primary focus. Thus, I'll adjust the scores to reflect this.",
