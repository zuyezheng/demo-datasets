    "critique": "The executive order discusses human trafficking and child exploitation, aiming to evoke strong negative emotions and a sense of urgency. The primary emotions conveyed are fear and disgust due to the nature of the crimes described. Sadness is also present, stemming from the suffering of the victims. Surprise might be a factor, but to a lesser extent, as many people are aware of these issues, though the scale of the problem might be surprising. Joy is not intended to be conveyed. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
