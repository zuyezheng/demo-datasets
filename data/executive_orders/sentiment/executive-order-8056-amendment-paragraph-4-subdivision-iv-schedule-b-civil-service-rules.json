    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative update related to civil service rules. It doesn't appear to intentionally evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order is factual and procedural, with no language suggesting an attempt to inspire joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon further reflection, it is unlikely that this order would evoke any emotions. The revised scores reflect this by setting all emotions to 1.",
