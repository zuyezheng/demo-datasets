    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a fetal tissue bank for medical research. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a slight sense of hope and determination to find treatments for diseases, but overall, the document is neutral in tone. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be scored low. The initial scores reflect this assessment, and the revised scores maintain the same low levels to reflect the document's neutral and formal nature.",
