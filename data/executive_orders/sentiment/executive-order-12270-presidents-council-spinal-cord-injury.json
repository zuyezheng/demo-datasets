    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a council on spinal cord injury. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the establishment of such a council could imply a sense of hope (joy) for those affected by spinal cord injuries and a sense of concern (sadness) for their situation. Fear, disgust, and surprise are not evident. Considering the formal nature, the emotional scores should be low.",
