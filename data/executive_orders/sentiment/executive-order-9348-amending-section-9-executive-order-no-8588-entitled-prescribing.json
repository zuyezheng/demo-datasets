    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a technical amendment related to what can be included as household goods and personal effects during wartime rationing. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to communicate a change in regulations. However, a tiny amount of relief/joy might be conveyed due to the inclusion of groceries and provisions during rationing. There might also be a tiny amount of surprise that such an order was made.",
