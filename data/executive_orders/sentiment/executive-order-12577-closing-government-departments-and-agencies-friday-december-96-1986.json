It declares that federal departments and agencies will be closed the day after Christmas, with exceptions for national security, defense, or other public reasons. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional content. The primary purpose is to communicate a decision, not to evoke an emotional response. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default of 1 where there is no clear indication of the emotion.",
