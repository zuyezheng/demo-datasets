    "critique": "The executive order emphasizes the importance of the Alaska Railroad for national security, economic development, and the well-being of Alaskan citizens. The order aims to convey a sense of urgency and importance, highlighting the need for immediate action to rehabilitate the railroad. The mention of an 'extraordinary emergency' and the suspension of labor laws suggest a need to address a critical situation. The order should evoke a sense of seriousness and perhaps a touch of concern, but also confidence that the situation is being handled effectively. Therefore, I will score it for fear, surprise, and joy.",
