There is no explicit expression of emotion. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a neutral emotional tone. After further consideration, the formal and legal nature of the document suggests that a neutral emotional tone is appropriate. Therefore, the revised scores remain unchanged.",
