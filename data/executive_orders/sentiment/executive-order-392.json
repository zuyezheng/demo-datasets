    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to convey a sense of order, transition, and gratitude. Joy might be present due to the promotion of Generals Grant, Sherman, and McPherson, but it's not the primary emotion. Sadness could be present due to Halleck being relieved, but the expression of gratitude mitigates this. Fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be conveyed. Therefore, I will score joy, sadness, and surprise, and then revise the scores based on the critique.",
