    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on protecting coral reef ecosystems. It outlines policies, responsibilities, and duties for federal agencies and the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force. The language is formal and legalistic, with a focus on preservation and cooperation. There is a sense of responsibility and urgency, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions.",
