    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal announcement regarding cost of living adjustments and their impact on compensation for government employees. It's based on factual data and legal provisions, aiming to inform the concerned parties about the changes in compensation. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The order is purely informational and procedural. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
