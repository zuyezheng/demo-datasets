    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Cement Industry. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment in implementing the National Industrial Recovery Act. The public is expected to feel a mild sense of optimism and confidence in the government's actions. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions except joy, which will receive a slightly higher score.",
