    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It declares that federal offices will be closed the day after Christmas, with exceptions for national security or other public reasons. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit emotional content. The most relevant emotion might be a slight sense of joy or relief for federal employees getting an extra day off, but this is very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
