    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the closure of executive departments and agencies on December 26, 1997. The language is formal and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the decision to close government offices for a day after Christmas could be interpreted as a gesture of goodwill, potentially conveying a slight sense of joy or consideration for employees. Given the formal nature, the intensity of any emotion is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I will assign low scores for joy and leave the other emotions at a baseline level.",
