    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of an agreement related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The language is legal and administrative. There is no strong emotional content. A baseline of 1 is appropriate for most emotions. There might be a slight sense of joy or optimism associated with the approval of the agreement, but it's very mild. Therefore, I will assign a score of 2 for joy and 1 for all other emotions.",
