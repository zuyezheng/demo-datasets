It highlights the appointment of a qualified individual to fulfill a specific task related to important historical records. The order aims to reassure the audience that the government is capable of handling its responsibilities effectively. It does not seem to want the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. However, there might be a slight element of surprise due to the specific nature of the appointment and the historical context.",
