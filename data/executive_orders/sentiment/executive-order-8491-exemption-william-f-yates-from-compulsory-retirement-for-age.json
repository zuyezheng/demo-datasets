    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on the administrative task of exempting an individual from mandatory retirement. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to inform and execute a specific decision, maintaining a professional and objective stance. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be very low. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily informational, there might be a slight element of 'surprise' that such a specific exemption is being made via executive order, and a very mild sense of 'joy' that Mr. Yates gets to continue working. However, these would be very subtle.",
