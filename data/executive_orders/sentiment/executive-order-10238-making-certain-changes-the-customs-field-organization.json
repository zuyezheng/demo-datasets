    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding changes to customs field organization. It revokes the designation of Provincetown, Massachusetts, and Lewes, Delaware, as customs ports of entry, extends the limits of the customs port of entry of New London, Connecticut, and designates Pelican, Alaska, as a customs port of entry. The language is formal and bureaucratic, and the content is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
