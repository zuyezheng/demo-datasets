    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding changes to customs field organization. It revokes the designation of two locations as customs ports of entry, extends the limits of another, and designates a new one. The language is formal and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the emotion scores should be very low, with a baseline of 1 for each emotion due to the document's formal nature.",
