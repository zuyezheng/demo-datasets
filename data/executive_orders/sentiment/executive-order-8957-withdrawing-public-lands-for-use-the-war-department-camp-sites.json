    "critique": "The executive order seems to convey a sense of seriousness and importance, but doesn't strongly evoke any specific emotion. The order is factual and formal, so it doesn't seem to aim to make the audience feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is related to military use, so I will adjust the fear and surprise scores to reflect that.",
