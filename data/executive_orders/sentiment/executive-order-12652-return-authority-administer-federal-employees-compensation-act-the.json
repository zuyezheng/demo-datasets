    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the administration of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act as it applies to the employees of the Panama Canal Commission. It rescinds a previous executive order and a Department of Defense memorandum related to the delegation of Panama Canal functions. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially, as there is not enough information to suggest any specific emotional response. Upon review, I still believe a score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion, as the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any strong emotional response from the public.",
