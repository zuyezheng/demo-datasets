It refers to specific acts and resolutions, suggesting a legal or administrative context. The language is formal and does not obviously evoke strong emotions. However, the reestablishment of the board might bring a sense of stability and perhaps mild joy to those who benefit from it, and mild surprise to those who did not expect it. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
