    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order from 1936. It primarily conveys a sense of official business and legal compliance. There is a slight hint of positive sentiment in recognizing Albert F. Woods's service and extending it, but it's very subdued. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low, with joy being slightly higher than the others.",
