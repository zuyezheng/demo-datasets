    "critique": "The executive order aims to address inequities faced by Hispanic and Latino students and promote their educational and economic opportunities. It acknowledges existing disparities and outlines policy goals and initiatives to support this community. The order seeks to inspire hope and a sense of opportunity, while also acknowledging the challenges and potential for disappointment if the initiatives fail. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed should be joy (related to opportunity and progress) and sadness (related to the existing inequities). There might be a touch of surprise at the extent of the inequities, but this is secondary. There is no intention to convey anger, fear, or disgust.",
