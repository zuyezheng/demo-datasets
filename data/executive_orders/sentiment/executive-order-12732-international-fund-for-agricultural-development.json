    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration, so it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The order is about designating the International Fund for Agricultural Development as a public international organization. This might bring a slight sense of joy to those who support the organization's goals, and perhaps a very mild surprise to those unaware of the designation. There's no apparent reason for sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
