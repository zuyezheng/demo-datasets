    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing international finance during a declared national emergency. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of urgency and resolve to protect the economic interests of the United States. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a prominent emotion, as the order seems to be a planned response to an existing situation. The order conveys a sense of seriousness and determination. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise. I will assign a slightly higher score to fear because the order is issued in response to a 'national emergency'.",
