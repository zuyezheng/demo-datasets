    "critique": "The document is an amendment to an executive order regarding Presidential Scholars. It focuses on awards for special capabilities in visual and performing arts and creative writing. The language is formal and official. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, might be a mild sense of joy or pride in supporting the arts and creative writing, but it's very subtle. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
