    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of formality and official procedure rather than strong emotions. It's about recognizing talent in arts and writing, which might evoke a mild sense of joy or satisfaction, but it's not the primary goal. The order itself doesn't seem designed to elicit sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy. The revised scores are even lower, acknowledging the minimal emotional impact.",
