It aims to ensure the proper handling of remains in the context of the Panama Canal Treaty. The primary emotion it evokes is sadness, related to the loss of life and the need to relocate remains. There might be a touch of surprise for those unaware of the situation, but it's not the main focus. There's no intention to evoke joy, anger, fear, or disgust.",
