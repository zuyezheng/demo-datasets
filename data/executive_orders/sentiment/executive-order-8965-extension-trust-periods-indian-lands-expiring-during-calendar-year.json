    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending trust periods for Indian lands. It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is minimal. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary purpose is to enact a policy decision. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional expression in the document. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After further consideration, I still believe that the emotional content is minimal and the initial scores accurately reflect this. Therefore, the revised scores will remain the same.",
