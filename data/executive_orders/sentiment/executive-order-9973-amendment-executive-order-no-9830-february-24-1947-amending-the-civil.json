    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding civil service rules. It primarily focuses on internal management and legal stipulations. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of overt emotional content. Given the nature of the document, a score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion to indicate a minimal presence.",
