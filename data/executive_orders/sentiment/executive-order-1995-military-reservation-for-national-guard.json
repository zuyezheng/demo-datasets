    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land use. It sets aside land for a rifle range for the Arizona militia and stipulates that the land will revert to its former status as an Indian reservation when no longer needed for the rifle range. There is no explicit emotional language used. The primary emotion conveyed might be a sense of duty or administrative action, but this is not strongly expressed. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After further consideration, the document is purely administrative and should not evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores reflect this.",
