    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that modifies previous executive orders related to land use in Arizona. It opens up some land for use as a rifle range for the state militia, with a provision for the land to revert to its former status as an Indian reservation when no longer needed for the rifle range. The order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. It might bring a bit of joy to the state militia, and perhaps a bit of sadness or disgust to those who wanted the land to remain as part of the Indian reservation. Surprise is not really relevant here, and fear is unlikely. I will start with initial scores of joy: 2, sadness: 2, disgust: 1, fear: 0, surprise: 0. After further consideration, I think the emotional impact is minimal, so I will revise the scores to be even lower.",
