It focuses on the operational and administrative aspects of power generation and distribution. There is no explicit emotional language used. Therefore, the emotion scores should be relatively low across all emotions. Considering it is a formal document, a baseline of 1 is appropriate for emotions that are not explicitly conveyed.",
