There might be a hint of joy that the widow is being offered a position. There is no indication of fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is moderate, around 5, given the formal tone. The joy is minimal, around 2, as it's more about providing support than expressing happiness. The other emotions are negligible.",
