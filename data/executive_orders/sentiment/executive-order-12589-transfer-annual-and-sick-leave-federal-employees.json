    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal and legal document. It does not appear to be intended to evoke any strong emotions. The order is delegating authority to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to prepare a report and prescribe regulations regarding the transfer of leave among federal employees. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
