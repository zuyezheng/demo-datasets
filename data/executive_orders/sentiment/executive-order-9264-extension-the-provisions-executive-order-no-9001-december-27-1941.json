    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of duty, resolve, and perhaps a touch of reassurance during wartime. It extends existing powers to the Department of Commerce to facilitate the war effort. Considering these goals, the primary emotions to convey would be a low level of joy (a sense of things going well), a low level of sadness (acknowledging the somber context of war), and a moderate level of reassurance to inspire confidence. The order does not seem to want to inspire fear, disgust, or surprise.",
