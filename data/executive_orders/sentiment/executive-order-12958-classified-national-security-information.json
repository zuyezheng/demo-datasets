    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the classification, safeguarding, and declassification of national security information. The language is legalistic and procedural. The President aims to convey a sense of responsibility, commitment to open government balanced with national security concerns, and authority. There is no indication of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is intended to be taken seriously and to establish clear guidelines.
