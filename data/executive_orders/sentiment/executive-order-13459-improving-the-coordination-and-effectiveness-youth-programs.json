    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish an interagency working group to help at-risk youth. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a slight sense of joy might be inferred from the positive goal of helping youth. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect a low level of joy and very low levels of other emotions.",
