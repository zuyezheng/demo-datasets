    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish an interagency working group to help at-risk youth. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of optimism and hope for positive change, but it is very subdued. There is no strong expression of any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. I will revise the scores to reflect the subtle positive undertones.",
