    "critique": "The document is a formal proclamation regarding labor regulations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration during a national emergency. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of urgency and determination to achieve national objectives in aeronautics and space. There's a hint of surprise that such measures are needed, but it's not the dominant emotion. There is no explicit anger, disgust, fear, joy or sadness. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with surprise being the only emotion with a non-zero score. The revised scores slightly increase the surprise to reflect the unexpected nature of the proclamation.",
