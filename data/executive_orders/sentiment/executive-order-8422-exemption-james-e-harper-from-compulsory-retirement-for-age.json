    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of an individual from compulsory retirement. It is a legal document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of approval or satisfaction in ensuring the continued service of a valuable employee, but this would be very subtle. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on joy.",
