It aims to reduce the number of excepted positions and allow for transfers under certain conditions. The intended emotional response is likely to be minimal, as it's a bureaucratic adjustment. There might be a slight sense of positive surprise due to the change and a mild sense of joy that the changes may be beneficial. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
