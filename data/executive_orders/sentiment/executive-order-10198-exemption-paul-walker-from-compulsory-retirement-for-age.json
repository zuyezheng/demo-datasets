    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document regarding the retirement of a member of the Federal Communications Commission. The order uses formal language and focuses on legal and procedural aspects. It aims to convey a sense of official action and adherence to regulations. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate a decision made in the public interest, based on established authority. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily informational, there might be a very slight element of surprise that the order is being issued. However, this would be minimal.",
