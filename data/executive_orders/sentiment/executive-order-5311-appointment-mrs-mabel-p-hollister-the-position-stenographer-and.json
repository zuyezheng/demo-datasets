    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to convey a sense of justice and compassion for Mrs. Hollister, the widow of a dedicated public servant. While it's not explicitly designed to evoke strong emotions, there's an underlying sense of sadness due to the circumstances of Mr. Hollister's death and a subtle feeling of joy that Mrs. Hollister is being taken care of. Surprise, disgust, and fear are not intended emotions. The initial scores reflect these subtle emotions, with sadness being slightly higher due to the context of the order. The revised scores slightly adjust the joy and sadness levels to better reflect the intended emotional impact.",
