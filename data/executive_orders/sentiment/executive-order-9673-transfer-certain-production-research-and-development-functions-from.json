    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, transferring functions from one department to another. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of relief (joy) that the government is reorganizing after the war. There might also be a very mild surprise that this is happening. Fear, disgust, and sadness are unlikely to be conveyed.",
