    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order. It establishes and defines roles within the Office of Consumer Affairs. The language is formal and administrative. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the nature of the document, the intensity of each emotion is likely to be very low. Therefore, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for each emotion to reflect the lack of emotional expression.",
