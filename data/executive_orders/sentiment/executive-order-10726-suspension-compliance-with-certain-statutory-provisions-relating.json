    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document about employment in the Canal Zone. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order suspends compliance with certain provisions of two acts, but clarifies that it does not affect compensation for certain positions. Therefore, the primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such an order is necessary, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
