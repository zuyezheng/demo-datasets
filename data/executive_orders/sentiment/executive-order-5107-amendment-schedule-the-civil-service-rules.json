    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative update regarding positions exempt from civil service examination. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. After further consideration, the order might evoke a tiny bit of surprise due to the administrative nature of the update, but the intensity would be minimal.",
