The language is legal and administrative, with no emotional tone. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions scored at 1. After reflection, I confirm that there is no indication of any specific emotion being conveyed or intended in this document.",
