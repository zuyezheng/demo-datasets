    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the classification, downgrading, declassification, and safeguarding of national security information. It aims to balance the public's right to information with the need to protect sensitive government affairs. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on procedures, authorities, and responsibilities. There is a sense of seriousness and caution conveyed due to the subject matter, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with slight emphasis on fear and disgust due to the nature of protecting information from unauthorized disclosure.",
