    "critique": "The document expresses determination and a call to action, but lacks strong emotional conveyance. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of reassurance or hope, but it's not overtly joyful. There's no explicit sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also absent. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with slight emphasis on joy and surprise due to the positive nature of the policy announcement. The revised scores adjust to reflect the document's overall neutral tone, reducing the initial emphasis on joy and surprise.",
