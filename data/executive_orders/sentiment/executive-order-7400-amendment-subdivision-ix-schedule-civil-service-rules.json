    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical amendment to civil service rules. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order concerns employment rules for local veterinarians, which is unlikely to generate intense feelings. The most relevant emotion might be a mild surprise that such a specific rule is being addressed at the presidential level, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, all emotions are scored very low initially.",
