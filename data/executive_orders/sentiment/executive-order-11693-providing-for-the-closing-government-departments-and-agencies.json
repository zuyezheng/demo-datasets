    "critique": "The document is an official order to close government offices as a mark of respect for Harry S Truman. The language is formal and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the act of closing offices suggests a degree of sadness and respect. The order also conveys a sense of formality and respect for the deceased president. The intensity of sadness is likely to be moderate, as it is a formal gesture. Other emotions are not strongly conveyed.",
