    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of land between two national forests. It uses formal language and aims to be precise and factual. There is no explicit emotional expression. However, one could argue there is a very mild sense of joy that the administration is effectively managing public lands, and a mild sense of importance or surprise that such an order is being made. All other emotions are not present.",
