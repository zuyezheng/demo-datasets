The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of resolute action and authority, with a hint of concern due to the state of war. There isn't a strong presence of joy, sadness, or surprise. Disgust might be present due to the context of war, but it's not explicitly stated. Fear is also a possibility, but it's more about taking necessary actions during wartime.",
