It is a legal document, and as such, it is expected to be neutral in tone and devoid of strong emotional expression. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the document's objective and formal nature. Considering the lack of emotional indicators, a score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion.",
