    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that primarily aims to inform the public about a decision. It does not explicitly try to evoke any strong emotions. The order is related to tax returns and their inspection by a House of Representatives committee. While some individuals might feel a slight surprise or concern regarding government oversight, the overall tone is neutral and official. Therefore, the emotion scores should be relatively low across all categories.",
