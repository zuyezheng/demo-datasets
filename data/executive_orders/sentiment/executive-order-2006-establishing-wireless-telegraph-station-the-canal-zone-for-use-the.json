    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a simple assignment of land for naval purposes. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion the president wants to convey. The language is formal and factual. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily factual, there might be a slight sense of reassurance or confidence the president wants to convey, so I will adjust the joy score slightly upwards.",
