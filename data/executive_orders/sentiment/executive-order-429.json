The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a neutral emotional tone. After further consideration, the initial scores remain appropriate as the document's purpose is purely administrative and does not convey any specific emotion.",
