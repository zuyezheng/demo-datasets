    "critique": "The executive order seems to be suspending a previous order related to funds for refugees and freedmen. This could evoke sadness in those who believe it will negatively impact these groups. It might also cause surprise as it reverses a previous decision. There's a potential for disgust or anger among those who strongly disagree with the suspension, but the order itself is fairly neutral in tone. Joy and fear are unlikely to be primary emotions conveyed.",
