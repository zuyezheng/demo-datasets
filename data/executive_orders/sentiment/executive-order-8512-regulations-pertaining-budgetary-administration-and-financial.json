    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding financial reporting and budgetary control. It is primarily concerned with establishing regulations and procedures. Therefore, the emotions conveyed are minimal. Considering it is a formal document, I would expect the emotions to be very low. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions set to 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the emotional content is minimal, so the revised scores remain the same.",
