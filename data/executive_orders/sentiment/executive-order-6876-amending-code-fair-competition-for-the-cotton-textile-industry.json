    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding an amendment to the Code of Fair Competition for the Cotton Textile Industry. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The President aims to convey a sense of order, compliance, and progress in implementing the National Industrial Recovery Act. However, the document itself doesn't evoke strong emotions. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After a second thought, I realized that while the document is formal, the act itself was designed to bring Joy and reduce Fear during the great depression, so I will revise the scores to reflect that.",
