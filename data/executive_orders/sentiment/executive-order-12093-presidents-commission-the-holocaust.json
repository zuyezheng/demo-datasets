    "critique": "The executive order aims to create a memorial for the victims of the Holocaust. The primary emotion it should evoke is sadness, with a secondary emotion of respect and solemnity, which can be interpreted as a low level of joy in the sense of honoring the victims. There might also be a sense of surprise that such an atrocity occurred, but the main focus is on remembering and honoring the victims, so sadness should be the strongest emotion.",
