    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and official action, rather than any specific emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon further reflection, while the document itself doesn't express emotion, the act of issuing an executive order might imply a sense of determination or resolve to address a particular issue. However, without knowing the specific context or issue being addressed, it's difficult to assign a high score to any particular emotion. I will adjust the 'surprise' score to 2, as executive orders are not generally surprising.",
