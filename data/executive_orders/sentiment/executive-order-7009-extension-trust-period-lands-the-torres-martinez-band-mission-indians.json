    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that extends the period of trust on lands held for the Torres-Martinez Band of Mission Indians. The order itself doesn't explicitly aim to evoke any particular emotion. However, one could argue that it might bring a sense of joy or relief to the members of the Torres-Martinez Band, as it ensures the continued protection of their lands. Conversely, someone opposed to the interests of the Band might feel some level of disgust or anger. However, given the neutral tone and legal nature of the document, the primary emotions conveyed are likely to be minimal. Thus, the initial scores are all set to zero.",
