    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration by the President of the United States regarding Canton Island and Enderbury Island. It primarily concerns the administrative control and jurisdiction of these islands. Given the formal and administrative nature of the document, the emotional intensity is expected to be low across all emotions. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion.",
