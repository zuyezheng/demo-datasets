It's a legal and administrative document, so it's unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary purpose is to execute a legal action, not to evoke feelings. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on neutral or slightly positive emotions due to the act of preservation.",
