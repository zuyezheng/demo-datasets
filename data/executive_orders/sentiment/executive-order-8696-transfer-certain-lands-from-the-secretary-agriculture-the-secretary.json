    "critique": "The document is a legal order transferring jurisdiction over certain lands in New Mexico from the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the Interior, for the use of Pueblo Indians. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit emotional content. However, the act of transferring land for the use of Pueblo Indians could be interpreted as a positive action, potentially conveying a sense of joy or hope, but this is very subtle. It could also be interpreted as a surprise that the land is being transferred. It is unlikely to convey sadness, fear, or disgust. I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and very low scores to the other emotions.",
