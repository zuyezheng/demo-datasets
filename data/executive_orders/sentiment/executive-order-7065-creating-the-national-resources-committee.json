    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the National Resources Committee. The language is legal and administrative, with no overt emotional expression. The primary goal is to convey information and establish a governmental body. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, around 1, indicating a lack of strong emotional conveyance. There might be a slight sense of surprise (2) due to the establishment of a new committee, but overall, the document is emotionally neutral.",
