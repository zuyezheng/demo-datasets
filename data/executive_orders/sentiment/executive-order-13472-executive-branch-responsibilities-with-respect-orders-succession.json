    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the order of succession within executive branch agencies. It is primarily concerned with establishing and maintaining clear lines of authority in case of incapacitation of agency heads. The language is formal and legalistic, with no overt emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal. Most people would likely not have a strong emotional reaction to this document. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such an order is necessary, but even that would be quite low. Given the lack of emotional content, all initial scores are set to 1.",
