    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Afghanistan Support Office. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotion conveyed. A low score is appropriate for all emotions. The purpose is to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorists, which could imply a hint of fear and disgust, but it is very subtle. The document expresses a goal of facilitating Afghanistan's progress to self-sufficiency, which could imply a hint of joy, but it is very subtle. The document also expresses the need to maintain an effective diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, which could imply a hint of sadness, but it is very subtle. The document does not express any surprise.",
