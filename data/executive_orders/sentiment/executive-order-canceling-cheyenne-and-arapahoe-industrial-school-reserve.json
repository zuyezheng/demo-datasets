    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal for a school for Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians. It is a factual statement, so it does not convey strong emotions. The baseline should be 1 for all emotions, as it is a formal document. There is a slight element of positive sentiment due to the establishment of a school, so I will increase the joy score to 2. There is no indication of negative emotions.",
