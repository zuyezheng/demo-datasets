The order is to withdraw land from settlement and entry and reserve it for a boarding and industrial school for the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians. This is a factual statement, and there is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
