However, the subject matter (victims of crime) could evoke sadness and perhaps a sense of hope (joy) that the task force will improve the situation. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise in the text itself. The scores are assigned based on the implied emotions related to the topic, not the explicit text.",
