    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining regulations for quarantine and public health in the Philippines. The primary emotion it aims to convey is a sense of seriousness and importance regarding public health. While it doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions, a secondary goal might be to instill a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect its citizens. Therefore, I will score it for fear and surprise.",
