    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative update concerning the Army and Navy General Hospital. It specifies the rate at which enlisted men's rations are commuted while they are under treatment or on duty at the hospital. The language is formal and procedural, with no apparent intention to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Revised scores are the same as initial scores because the initial assessment seems correct.",
