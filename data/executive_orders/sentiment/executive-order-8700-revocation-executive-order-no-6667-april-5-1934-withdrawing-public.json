    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land resurvey in Colorado. It revokes a previous order and specifies the effective date. There is no explicit emotional language used. The expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal, as it's a technical and administrative matter. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After further consideration, the initial scores seem appropriate as the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke strong emotions.",
