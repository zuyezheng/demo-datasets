    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of Joy and Surprise. The order is exempting someone from retirement, so that could bring joy. It could also bring surprise, as it is not common to exempt someone from retirement. However, the order is also very formal, so it is unlikely that it wants to convey any strong emotions. Therefore, I will revise the scores to be lower.",
