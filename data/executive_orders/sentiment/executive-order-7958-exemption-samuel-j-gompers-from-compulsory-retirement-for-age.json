    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, exempting an employee from mandatory retirement. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of joy that Samuel J. Gompers gets to continue working for another year, and perhaps a touch of surprise that such an order is issued. The scores should be very low, reflecting the minimal emotional impact.",
