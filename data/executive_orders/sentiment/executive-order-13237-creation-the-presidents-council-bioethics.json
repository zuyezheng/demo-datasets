    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Council on Bioethics. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. The order focuses on the structure, membership, and administration of the council. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains clear, so the revised scores will also remain at 1 for all emotions.",
