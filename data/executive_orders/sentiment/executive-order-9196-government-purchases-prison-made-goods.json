It seeks to reassure the public that the government is taking all necessary steps to ensure the effective utilization of resources. While not explicitly evoking strong emotions, it subtly aims to instill a sense of confidence and perhaps a touch of surprise at the extent of the measures being taken.The initial scores reflect a baseline assessment of the emotions potentially conveyed, with adjustments made to emphasize the intended message of resolve and confidence.",
