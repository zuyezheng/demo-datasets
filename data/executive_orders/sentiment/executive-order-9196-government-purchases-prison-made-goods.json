The purpose of the order is to suspend a previous executive order to ensure the effective utilization of all existing productive facilities during the war. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, there is a sense of urgency and determination to remove any obstacles to the war effort. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions except for surprise, which will be scored as 1 due to lack of information.",
