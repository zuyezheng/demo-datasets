    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document that aims to convey a sense of order, authority, and efficiency in transferring governmental functions. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate the changes in a clear and concise manner. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
