    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It waives examination requirements for a specific individual, based on the Postmaster General's recommendation and their prior service. The language is formal and bureaucratic, and the content is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The order is about efficiency and internal processes, not about causing joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
