I should consider the content, context, and language used to determine the emotions conveyed. Then, I should score the relative intensity of each emotion (joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise) on a scale of 1-10, reflecting how the American public is expected to feel. Finally, I will provide a critique of my initial scores and revise them accordingly.",
