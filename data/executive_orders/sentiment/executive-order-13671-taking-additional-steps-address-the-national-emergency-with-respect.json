    "critique": "The executive order discusses serious issues like violence, human rights abuses, and the use of child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The order aims to address these issues by blocking the assets of individuals and groups involved in these activities. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are a sense of seriousness and concern about the situation, as well as a determination to take action. Fear and disgust are relevant due to the nature of the activities described, but the order is more focused on conveying a sense of resolve and the need for action rather than directly eliciting those emotions in the reader. Surprise is not a primary emotion conveyed by this document.",
