There is a sense of seriousness and resolve, but not overt displays of emotion. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows: Joy: 1, Sadness: 4, Fear: 5, Disgust: 6, Surprise: 2. After further consideration, I will revise the scores to reflect the formal tone and the underlying emotions more accurately.",
