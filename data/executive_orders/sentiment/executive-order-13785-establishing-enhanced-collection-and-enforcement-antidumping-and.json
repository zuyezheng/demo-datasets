    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of determination and resolve to address unfair trade practices and protect American businesses and revenue. There's a hint of concern regarding the uncollected duties, but the overall tone is assertive and focused on enforcement. Therefore, I would expect the American public to feel a low level of fear and disgust, and a moderate level of surprise. There is no indication of joy or sadness.",
