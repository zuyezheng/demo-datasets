The primary goal is to establish a board to investigate and resolve the dispute to prevent disruption of interstate commerce. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on concern or seriousness, which might translate to a touch of sadness or fear related to the potential disruption.",
