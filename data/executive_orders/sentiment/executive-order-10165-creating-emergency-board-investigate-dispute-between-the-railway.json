    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the establishment of a board to investigate a dispute. It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle element of reassurance or relief that the government is taking action to prevent disruption of essential transportation services. Therefore, I will assign low scores to surprise. After further consideration, the primary goal seems to be to convey a sense of calm and order, so I will reduce the surprise score to 1.",
