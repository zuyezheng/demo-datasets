    "critique": "The document expresses a formal and legal tone, with a focus on policy and enforcement. It references historical context and legal interpretations. There is a sense of determination and resolve in establishing the policy, but emotions are largely suppressed in favor of a neutral and objective presentation. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all relatively low. The reference to Dred Scott v. Sandford introduces a hint of disgust at the historical injustice.",
