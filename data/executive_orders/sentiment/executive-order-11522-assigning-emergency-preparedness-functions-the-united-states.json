    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim at conveying a sense of preparedness and reassurance rather than strong emotions. The order focuses on planning and coordination during a national emergency, suggesting a need for calm and confidence. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed would be a low level of surprise, as the audience may not expect such detailed planning. There may also be a low level of fear, as the order addresses potential attacks on the United States.",
