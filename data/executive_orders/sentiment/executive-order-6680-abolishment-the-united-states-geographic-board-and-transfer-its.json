    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the abolishment of the United States Geographic Board and the transfer of its functions to the Department of the Interior. The language is very formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. A low level of sadness might be present due to the abolishment of the board, but it's minimal. Surprise, fear, disgust, and joy are not apparent in the text. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
