    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the abolishment of the United States Geographic Board and the transfer of its functions to the Department of the Interior. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a base score of 1 for all emotions initially, as there is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. After further consideration, the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are appropriate.",
