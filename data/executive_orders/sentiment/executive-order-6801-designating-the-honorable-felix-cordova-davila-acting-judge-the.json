    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, designating an acting judge for the District Court of the United States for Puerto Rico. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue there's a hint of surprise that a judge needs to be designated, and perhaps a touch of joy that a qualified individual is available to fill the role. The other emotions seem absent. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are even more muted, recognizing the document's primary function is administrative.",
