    "critique": "The executive order addresses complaints about troop quotas and aims to resolve controversies and avoid delays in filling up armies. The order seeks to ensure fairness and efficiency in the draft process. The emotions the president wants to convey are a sense of calm, resolve, and confidence in the fairness of the system. There is a hint of sadness because the order is about drafting troops during war time. There is no surprise, disgust, fear, or joy.",
