    "critique": "The document expresses a formal and legal tone, addressing complaints about troop quotas and establishing a board to resolve disputes. It aims to ensure fairness and efficiency in the draft process. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a slight sense of concern or urgency might be inferred due to the need to address complaints and expedite the draft. Therefore, the initial scores are set to 1 for all emotions except for a slightly elevated level of concern, which is set to 2. After further consideration, the document's primary goal is to establish a fair and efficient process, and the emotions conveyed are minimal. Therefore, the revised scores are set to 1 for all emotions.",
