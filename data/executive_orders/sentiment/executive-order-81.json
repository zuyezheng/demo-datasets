    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a mundane administrative document. It simply describes a tract of land being reserved for an experiment station. There's no indication of an intention to evoke any strong emotions in the reader. The only possible emotion might be a slight sense of surprise that such a specific order is being issued, but even that is minimal. The order includes a provision protecting the rights of natives, which could be interpreted as a positive thing, but it's not emphasized enough to evoke strong joy. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
