    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, focused on a specific personnel appointment. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The language is formal and bureaucratic, suggesting a neutral tone. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The initial scores are all 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon review, this seems appropriate, as the document is primarily informational and procedural.",
