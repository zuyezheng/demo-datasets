    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of official action and adherence to legal procedures. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. The president is making an exception to a rule, but the language is neutral. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon further reflection, the act of making an exception could be interpreted as a mild form of 'surprise' that the existing rule needs adjustment, or perhaps mild 'joy' that a valued individual can continue their service. However, these are very subtle, so I will keep the scores low, but adjust surprise and joy slightly upwards.",
