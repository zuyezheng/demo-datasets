    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal delegation of authority, with the purpose of prescribing limitations and exceptions on the rules and regulations governing the entry of aliens into the United States. The order is addressing a specific issue (Iranians holding nonimmigrant visas) and is meant to be effective immediately. The emotions the president wants to convey are likely related to a sense of urgency and seriousness, but not necessarily strong emotions. The order is more about taking action and addressing a situation than eliciting a strong emotional response. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low.",
