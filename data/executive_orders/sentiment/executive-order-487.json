    "critique": "The executive order expresses gratitude and pride in the Union forces' victories. It aims to evoke feelings of joy and patriotism while also instilling fear in the rebels. There's a sense of disgust towards the rebels and traitors. Surprise is not a primary emotion conveyed, but there might be a slight element of it due to the unexpected victories. Sadness is present due to the mention of the 'gallant dead,' but it's not the main focus.",
