    "critique": "The document is a recommendation for Mrs. Mary V. Kehoe to be appointed to a position. The text mentions the death of her husband and his service. This might evoke some sadness. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The recommendation itself is a neutral act. The mention of the deceased husband and his service might evoke a little sadness, but overall the document is quite neutral. So I will give a low score to sadness and 1 to the rest.",
