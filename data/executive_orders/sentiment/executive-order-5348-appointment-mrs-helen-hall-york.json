The order highlights her husband's sacrifice and her resulting financial hardship, aiming to generate a sense of sadness and perhaps a touch of gratitude. While joy isn't a primary emotion, there might be a subtle sense of relief that Mrs. York is being taken care of. Fear, disgust, and surprise are not intended emotions.",
