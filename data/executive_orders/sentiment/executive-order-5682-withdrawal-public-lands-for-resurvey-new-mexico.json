    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that withdraws land from settlement pending a resurvey. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform the public of the land withdrawal. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. The initial scores are all set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon review, these scores seem appropriate as the document is purely informational and procedural.",
