    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order regarding land in Alaska. It primarily deals with legal and administrative matters. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will give a score of 1 for joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise as there is no indication of these emotions. There also isn't any anger so I will give it a score of 1 as well.",
