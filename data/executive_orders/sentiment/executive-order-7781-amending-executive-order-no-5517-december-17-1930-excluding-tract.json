    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land in Alaska. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that the President is dealing with such a specific issue, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Most emotions would be scored very low, close to 1, as the document is factual and administrative in nature.",
