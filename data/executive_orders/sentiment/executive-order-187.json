    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry legal document. It does not seem to want to evoke any strong emotions. The order is about customs and vessels owned by Cuban residents. It clarifies the rights and privileges of these vessels and states that the use of the American flag does not confer any special rights. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order does not intend to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores remain the same.",
