    "critique": "The document expresses sadness and condemnation regarding the separation of families at the border. It also conveys a sense of hope and determination to reunite families and prevent future separations. The policy aims to address a human tragedy, protect family unity, and provide support to affected families. The establishment of a task force and the revocation of a previous executive order further emphasize the commitment to rectifying the situation. Therefore, sadness, fear, and joy are the primary emotions conveyed, with sadness being the most prominent due to the acknowledgment of the human tragedy. Surprise, disgust, and anger are less prominent but still present to some extent due to the condemnation of past policies and practices.",
