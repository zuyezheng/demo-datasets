    "critique": "The executive order aims to evoke a sense of joy and relief that families will be reunited, while also acknowledging the sadness and anger caused by the previous separation policy. There might also be a sense of surprise that such a policy was in place. The intensity of joy should be relatively high, as reunification is a positive outcome. Sadness and anger should be moderate, reflecting the past harm. Surprise might be lower, as the policy may be known to some.",
