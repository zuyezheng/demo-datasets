    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, control, and perhaps a little bit of reassurance that aviation policies are being well-coordinated. There might be a very mild sense of joy that things are running smoothly, but overall, it's not designed to evoke strong emotions. The order is very procedural and formal. The initial scores reflect this, but I will revise them to be even more muted, as the initial scores might be slightly overestimating the emotional impact.",
