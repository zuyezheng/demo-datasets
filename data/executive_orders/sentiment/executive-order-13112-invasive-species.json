    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding invasive species. It primarily conveys a sense of responsibility and determination to address the issue. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for responsibility/determination which translates to a low level of joy.",
