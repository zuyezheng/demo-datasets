    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, it does extend the Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, so it may evoke a small amount of joy. It also removes some language, so it may evoke a small amount of sadness. It also includes language protecting the Office of Management and Budget, so it may evoke a small amount of surprise.",
