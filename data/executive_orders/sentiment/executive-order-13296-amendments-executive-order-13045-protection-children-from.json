    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order, which typically does not convey strong emotions. The language is legal and procedural. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign initial scores of 1 for all emotions, indicating a very low level of conveyed emotion. After further consideration, the document extends the Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, which might evoke a slight sense of joy or relief in some people. However, the overall tone remains formal and unemotional. Therefore, I will keep the scores at 1 for all emotions.",
