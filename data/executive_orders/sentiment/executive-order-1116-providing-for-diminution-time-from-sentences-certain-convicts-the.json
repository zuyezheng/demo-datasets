    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the diminution of time for convicts in the Canal Zone penitentiary. It outlines the conditions under which convicts can have their sentences reduced and the penalties for violating the rules.The language is legalistic and devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the document could evoke a slight sense of joy for those who believe in rehabilitation and fairness within the prison system, and a slight sense of disgust for those who believe that criminals should not have their sentences reduced. Therefore, the revised scores will reflect a slight increase in joy and disgust.",
