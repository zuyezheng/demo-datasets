    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land management. It revokes a previous executive order concerning public lands in a specific township, which is now part of the Santa Fe National Forest. The language is neutral and factual, without any explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion to reflect this lack of emotional content.",
