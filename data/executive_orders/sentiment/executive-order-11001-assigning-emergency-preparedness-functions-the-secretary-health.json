    "critique": "The document is an executive order outlining the responsibilities of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in preparing for national emergencies. It is a formal and procedural document, and the primary emotion conveyed is fear due to the context of national emergencies, but it is presented in a calm and organized manner. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. The order aims to instill confidence through preparedness, but the underlying threat evokes fear.I will score fear as a 6, and the rest as 1.",
