    "critique": "The document is a formal definition of terms related to noncombatant service and training within the Selective Service Act. It is a legal and official document, and therefore, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary purpose is to provide clarity and establish definitions, not to evoke feelings. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After further consideration, the document is purely informational and devoid of emotional content. The scores should remain very low across all emotions.",
