    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a reservation for the Northern Cheyenne Indians. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of official action and legal formality. There is a hint of consideration for the welfare of the Northern Cheyenne Indians, but it is expressed through the act of setting aside land rather than through explicit emotional language. There is also a consideration for existing settlers. Therefore, the emotions are relatively muted. Considering this, the initial scores are as follows: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. After further consideration, I will revise the scores to reflect the slight positive sentiment towards the Northern Cheyenne Indians and the consideration for existing settlers.",
