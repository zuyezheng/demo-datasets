    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute between the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and its conductors. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but there may be a hint of sadness that a dispute exists and surprise that it has not been resolved. The initial scores reflect this, and the revised scores are adjusted to be even more neutral.",
