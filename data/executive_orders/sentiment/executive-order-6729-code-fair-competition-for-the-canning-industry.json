    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability rather than strong emotions. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire to convey order and control. Therefore, I would expect low scores for most emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of hope or optimism (joy) that the actions will lead to positive outcomes. There might also be a very mild sense of surprise that the order is being enacted.",
