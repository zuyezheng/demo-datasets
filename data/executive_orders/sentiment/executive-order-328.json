    "critique": "The executive order regarding the Treasury Department aims to instill a sense of security and order. The allowance of rifles for settlers suggests a need for protection, potentially evoking a mild sense of fear (2). The meticulousness of the order, specifying who can have rifles and under what conditions, aims to create a sense of control and reduce potential chaos, thus promoting a sense of calm and perhaps mild joy (3) that things are being handled properly. The Fitz John Porter order evokes surprise that such an old case is being revisited and resolved, and perhaps a bit of joy that justice is being served. The overall tone is formal and authoritative, not designed to elicit strong emotions. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
