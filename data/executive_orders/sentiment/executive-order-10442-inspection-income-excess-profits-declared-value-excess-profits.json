    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax returns and their inspection by a Senate committee. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains clear, so the revised scores will stay the same.",
