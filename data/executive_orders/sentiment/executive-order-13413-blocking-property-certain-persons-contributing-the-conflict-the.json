    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing a threat. It should evoke a sense of concern (fear) about the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a sense of resolve (lack of joy) in taking action. There might be a slight element of surprise that such measures are necessary, but the primary emotions are fear and a lack of joy. Disgust might be present due to the atrocities mentioned, and sadness might be present due to the violence.",
