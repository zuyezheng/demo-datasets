    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that revokes a previous order withdrawing public lands in Wyoming. The order is very specific and technical, and it is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions in the reader. The order is simply a matter of public record and does not contain any language that would be intended to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low.",
