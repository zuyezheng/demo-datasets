    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land use in North Dakota. It primarily concerns the revocation of a previous order and the temporary withdrawal of certain lands for specific purposes. Given the nature of the document, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and factual, aiming to establish a legal framework for land management. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a very low level of emotional expression. After further consideration, the document is purely administrative and legal, with no emotional content. Therefore, the revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
