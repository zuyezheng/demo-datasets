    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that establishes an oversight board for the Internal Revenue Service. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order, control, and responsible governance. Therefore, the emotion scores should be relatively low across the board. There might be a slight sense of surprise that such a board is being established, but it's not a major emotional response.",
