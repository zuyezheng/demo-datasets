    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a Design Liaison Council. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no strong emotional content. The order aims to improve the quality of design in the federal government, which could be interpreted as a positive goal, but the document itself doesn't express strong joy. There's no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive aim of improving design quality.",
