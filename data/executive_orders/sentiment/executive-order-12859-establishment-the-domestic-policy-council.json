    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document establishing the Domestic Policy Council. It outlines the council's membership, meeting procedures, and functions. The language is formal and procedural, with no obvious attempt to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue that the order aims to inspire a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's ability to manage domestic policy effectively. Therefore, I will assign a low score to joy. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the establishment of a new council, but it's minimal.",
