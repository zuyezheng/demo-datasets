    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to evoke sympathy and perhaps a touch of gratitude towards the government for supporting the widow of a deceased navy yard worker. The order describes a situation where a widow is being given a job due to her husband's death in service. This is likely to evoke sadness and perhaps some surprise that such an action can be taken. There isn't a strong indication of joy, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of sadness is moderate, as it's a somber situation but not overly tragic in the context of an official order. Surprise is lower, as such actions, while not common, aren't entirely unexpected. Therefore, the initial scores are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 6, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 3. Upon further reflection, the element of gratitude might be present, and the surprise might be slightly understated. The revised scores are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 7, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 4.",
