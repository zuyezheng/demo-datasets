    "critique": "The document describes the appointment of Mrs. Wanda Coolidge Carver to a position at the navy yard due to the death of her husband. The president is likely trying to convey sadness and perhaps some element of sympathy or concern. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is moderate, as it's a formal announcement rather than a personal expression of grief. The other emotions are minimal.",
