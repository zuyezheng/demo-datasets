The language is formal and bureaucratic, aiming to convey a sense of responsibility and efficiency. There's no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate policy and directives. Therefore, the emotion scores should be low across the board, reflecting the lack of emotional content.",
