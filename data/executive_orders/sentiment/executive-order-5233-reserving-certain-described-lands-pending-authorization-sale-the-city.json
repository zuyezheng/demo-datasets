    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that withdraws land from settlement for the purpose of protecting the watershed of Napa's municipal water system. The order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy for the residents of Napa, knowing their water source is being protected. There might also be a tinge of sadness for those who can no longer settle on the land, but this is likely minimal. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
