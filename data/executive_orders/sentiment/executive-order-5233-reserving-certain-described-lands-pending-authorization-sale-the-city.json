    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal for the City of Napa's water system protection. It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional intensity is expected to be low across all emotions. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and objective. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low, close to 1, for all emotions.",
