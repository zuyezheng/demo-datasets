The primary goal is to inform the public of this decision. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Initial assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, there might be a slight element of 'surprise' as the reader might not expect such a specific exemption.
