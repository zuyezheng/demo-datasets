    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of relief and hope to the people in the Territory of Hawaii, but also a sense of urgency and seriousness due to the ongoing war. Therefore, I will score joy, and surprise, but also some fear and sadness. The order aims to instill confidence that the government is taking action to support them during a difficult time. The intensity of joy should be moderate, as the situation is still serious. Surprise should be low, as such actions are not unexpected during wartime. Fear and sadness should also be low, as the order is meant to alleviate those feelings, not amplify them.",
