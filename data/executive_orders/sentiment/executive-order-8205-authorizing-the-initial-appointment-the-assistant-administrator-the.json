    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding appointments within the Federal Security Agency. It uses formal language and focuses on administrative procedures. There is no indication of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the neutral tone of the document. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After further consideration, the formal and administrative nature of the document suggests that a score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions, as there is no discernible emotional content.",
