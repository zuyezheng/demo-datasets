    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document that withdraws land from settlement, location, sale, or entry, and reserves it for public use. The order itself doesn't seem to explicitly evoke any particular emotion. However, one could argue that the act of preserving land for public use might evoke a sense of joy or perhaps even surprise in some readers. However, the primary purpose is administrative. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
