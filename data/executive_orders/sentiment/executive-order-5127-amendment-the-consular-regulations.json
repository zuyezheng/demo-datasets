The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. A baseline score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions, with slight increases where relevant. There might be a hint of sadness related to illness, but it's very mild. There is no explicit expression of joy, surprise, fear, or disgust.",
