    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It expresses a neutral tone, focusing on the facts of the dispute and the legal actions being taken. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, the initial scores seem appropriate given the formal and neutral tone of the document.",
