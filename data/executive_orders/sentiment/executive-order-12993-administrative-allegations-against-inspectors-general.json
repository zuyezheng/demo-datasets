It establishes a process for investigating allegations of wrongdoing, which could instill a sense of confidence in the government's accountability. There's no indication of wanting to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a very slight sense of reassurance or confidence might be intended.",
