    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of joy and hope by addressing discrimination and promoting employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. It also acknowledges past failures and expresses a commitment to improvement, which can evoke a sense of hope and optimism. Additionally, it may evoke a sense of sadness due to the current underrepresentation of individuals with disabilities in the Federal workforce. There might be a slight sense of surprise due to the renewed focus on this issue after previous efforts fell short.",
