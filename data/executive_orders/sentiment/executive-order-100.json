    "critique": "The document is a formal directive from the President to the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the expenditure of funds to combat potential epidemics. The language is formal and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, with a focus on legal provisions and instructions. There is a sense of urgency due to the mention of 'threatened or actual epidemic,' which introduces a degree of fear and concern. However, the primary tone is one of responsibility and action rather than overt emotional expression. Therefore, the scores should reflect this formal and action-oriented tone, with slight emphasis on fear and concern due to the subject matter.",
