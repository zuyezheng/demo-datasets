    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish a board to safeguard Americans' civil liberties. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of responsibility and determination to protect rights, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. After further consideration, I will revise the scores to reflect the subtle undertones of determination and responsibility.",
