    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration, so it shouldn't evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and authorize, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, while the order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions, the subject matter (investigation of the Tennessee Valley Authority) might indirectly cause some surprise or concern in those closely following the matter. Therefore, a slight increase in surprise and fear might be warranted.",
