It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. I will assign low scores across all emotions initially, and then revise based on a closer look. Initial scores: joy=1, sadness=1, surprise=1, fear=1, disgust=1. Upon review, there is no indication of any specific emotion being conveyed. The language is neutral and factual. Therefore, the scores should remain at the baseline level.",
