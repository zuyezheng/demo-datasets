It should not evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to inform and reassure the public that the government is taking steps to address environmental concerns in cooperation with state and local authorities. Therefore, the intensity of all emotions should be relatively low.",
