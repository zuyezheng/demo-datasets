However, there might be a subtle sense of reassurance and confidence that could be interpreted as a mild form of joy or relief.The initial scores are:Joy: 2Sadness: 0Anger: 0Fear: 0Disgust: 0Surprise: 1Upon further reflection, the executive order is primarily a bureaucratic decision and does not aim to evoke any strong emotions.
