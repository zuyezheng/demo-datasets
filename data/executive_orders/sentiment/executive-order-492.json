There is no strong emotion expressed, but a mild sense of control and perhaps a hint of satisfaction in ensuring the project is well-managed. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive framing of 'promoted by the exercise of a general supervision and control'.",
