    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a simple administrative decision about budget allocation and representation in expositions. It doesn't seem designed to evoke any strong emotions in the audience. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. After further consideration, it seems like there might be a very slight sense of disappointment or sadness that the Bureau of Education won't have its own display, but this is extremely minimal.",
