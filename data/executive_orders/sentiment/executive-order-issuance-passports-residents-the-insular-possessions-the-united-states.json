    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about passport issuance to residents of Insular Possessions. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. A very slight sense of joy might be present due to the expansion of rights, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with a small amount of joy and near-zero values for other emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores remain very low.",
