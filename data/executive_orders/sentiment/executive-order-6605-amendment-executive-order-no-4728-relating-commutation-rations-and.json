    "critique": "The executive order is a technical amendment to a previous order, adjusting subsistence and quarters allowances for personnel at the American Embassy in Moscow. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild surprise that such a specific detail is being addressed by an executive order, but the intensity would be very low. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
