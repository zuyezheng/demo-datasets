It primarily conveys a sense of authority and legal compliance, with a focus on ensuring the continuation of existing trade benefits. There is minimal emotional content. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 1, fear: 1, and disgust: 1. I will then revise the scores based on the document's content.",
