    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, focusing on the establishment of a board to investigate a dispute. It doesn't explicitly try to evoke strong emotions. However, a slight sense of reassurance or relief might be intended, suggesting that the situation is being handled. There might also be a very mild sense of surprise that such action is needed. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for surprise. The revised scores are similar, but with a slight adjustment to reduce the surprise score further, as the primary goal is to convey a sense of order and control rather than shock.",
