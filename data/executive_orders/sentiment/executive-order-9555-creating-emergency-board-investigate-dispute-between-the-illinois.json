    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order creating a board to investigate a dispute between a railroad company and its employees. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. The document expresses a sense of urgency due to the potential disruption of interstate commerce, but this doesn't translate directly into a strong emotional score. Therefore, a low score is appropriate for all emotions.",
