There is a sense of joy and respect, but no strong negative emotions. The order to salute the British flag signifies reconciliation and peace. The initial scores reflect these observations, with joy and respect being the primary emotions conveyed. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity of these emotions based on a more careful consideration of the language used.",
