    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute that is impeding the war effort. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of urgency and determination to resolve the issue and maintain production. There's a hint of concern about the potential negative impact of the labor dispute on the war effort, but it's not overwhelming. There is no explicit expression of joy, disgust, or surprise. The document is mostly matter-of-fact and focused on the legal and practical steps being taken. Therefore, joy, disgust and surprise will be scored as 1. Fear and sadness are present due to the war effort being impeded, but are not the primary emotions, so they will be scored lower than determination.",
