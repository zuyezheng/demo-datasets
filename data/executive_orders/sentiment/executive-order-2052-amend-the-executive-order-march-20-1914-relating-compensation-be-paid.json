    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order regarding injury compensation for employees of The Panama Canal and the Panama Railroad Company. The language is legalistic and focuses on the specifics of compensation distribution among family members in the event of an employee's death. The order does not seem intended to evoke strong emotions. However, it could bring a small amount of joy to those who are receiving compensation, and a small amount of sadness to those who are not. The order is unlikely to evoke anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
