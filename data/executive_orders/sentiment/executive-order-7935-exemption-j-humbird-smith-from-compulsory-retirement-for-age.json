    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to exempt J. Humbird Smith from compulsory retirement for one year. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue there is a slight sense of joy in allowing someone to continue working, and perhaps a touch of sadness that they were nearing retirement. Surprise, fear, disgust, and anger are not present. Given the formal nature, the scores should be low.",
