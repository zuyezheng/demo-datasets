There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of concern and urgency is present due to the potential disruption of interstate commerce. Therefore, I will assign low scores to sadness, fear, and surprise, and a slightly higher score to disgust due to the negative impact of the dispute. Joy is not present at all.",
