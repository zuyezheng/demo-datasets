    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the actions taken to address a labor dispute. It invokes legal authority and establishes a board to investigate the matter, emphasizing the importance of uninterrupted interstate commerce. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a subtle sense of reassurance and stability might be intended, suggesting that the situation is being handled responsibly and within the bounds of the law. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 1, indicating a very low level of emotional conveyance.",
