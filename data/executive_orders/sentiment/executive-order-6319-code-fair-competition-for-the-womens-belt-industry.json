    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's actions during the Great Depression. It focuses on compliance, approval, and order. The primary emotion conveyed should be joy that the government is taking action, but it is not overwhelming. There might be a touch of surprise that the government is able to act so quickly. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
