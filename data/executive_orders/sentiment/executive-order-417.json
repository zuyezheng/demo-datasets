    "critique": "The president wants to convey a sense of urgency and the need for security. The primary emotion is fear, with a secondary emotion of surprise that the current force is inadequate. There is no joy, sadness, or disgust conveyed in this executive order.The initial scores reflect this assessment, with fear scored at 7 and surprise at 3. The revised scores are similar, with a slight adjustment to fear to 8 to emphasize the urgency.",
