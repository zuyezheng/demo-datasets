    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that exempts an attorney from compulsory retirement for one year. The language is very formal and legalistic, and the purpose is simply to state a fact and enact a decision. There is no intention to evoke any strong emotions in the reader. The most relevant emotion might be a slight surprise that such an order is necessary, but even that is minimal. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. After further consideration, the surprise might be slightly higher than the other emotions, but still very low.",
