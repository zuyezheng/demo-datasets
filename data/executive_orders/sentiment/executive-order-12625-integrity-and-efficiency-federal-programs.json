    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency. The primary goal is to promote integrity, efficiency, and prevent fraud and abuse in Federal programs. The language is formal and legalistic, with a focus on establishing structures and responsibilities. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the underlying intent to improve government operations could be interpreted as a form of 'joy' in the sense of positive governance, and the focus on preventing fraud and abuse implies a concern about potential 'disgust' or 'sadness' related to corruption or inefficiency. Given the formal nature, these emotions are very muted. Surprise and fear are not relevant in this context.",
