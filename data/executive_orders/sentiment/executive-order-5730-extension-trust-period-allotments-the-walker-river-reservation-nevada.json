    "critique": "The executive order is a simple extension of a trust period. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. A slight sense of relief or satisfaction might be present for those affected, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight positive score for joy and near-zero scores for other emotions. After further consideration, I believe the joy score is too high and should be reduced, as the order is more procedural than emotionally impactful.",
