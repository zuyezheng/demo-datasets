    "critique": "The document is a formal letter from the United States Civil Service Commission to the President, recommending an amendment to a previous order regarding noncompetitive examinations for certain positions. The language is formal and bureaucratic, and the tone is respectful and professional. There is no indication of any strong emotion being conveyed. The letter simply requests a change to a previous order. Therefore, I would score all emotions as low initially. After further consideration, while the letter itself doesn't express strong emotions, the act of recommending an amendment could imply a slight level of concern or dissatisfaction with the current situation, which might translate to a very mild level of surprise or perhaps even slight disgust that the previous order wasn't optimal. However, these are very subtle and likely not intended to be strongly felt by the public.",
