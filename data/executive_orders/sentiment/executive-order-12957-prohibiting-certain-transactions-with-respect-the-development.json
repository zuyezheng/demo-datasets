    "critique": "The president likely wants to convey a sense of seriousness and concern regarding the threat posed by Iran. This would involve elements of fear and possibly disgust at the actions of the Iranian government, but not to an extreme degree. There might also be a slight element of surprise at the sudden declaration of a national emergency. Joy and sadness are unlikely to be emotions the president wants to evoke.",
