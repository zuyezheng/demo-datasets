    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the termination of the War Relocation Authority. It is a factual and administrative document. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the termination of such an authority might implicitly convey some relief (joy) that a wartime measure is no longer needed, but this is very subtle. There is also a hint of sadness as an organizational entity is being terminated. Given the formal nature, the scores should be low.",
