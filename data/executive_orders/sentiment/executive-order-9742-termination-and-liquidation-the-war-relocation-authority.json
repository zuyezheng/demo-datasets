    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal announcement about the termination of the War Relocation Authority. It outlines the process for winding up the affairs of the Authority and transferring responsibilities to the Secretary of the Interior. The order itself doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, considering the historical context (the War Relocation Authority was responsible for the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II), the termination of the authority might bring a sense of relief and perhaps even joy to those affected by the internment. There might also be a sense of surprise that it took this long to terminate the authority. However, the primary emotion conveyed is likely a muted sense of relief or satisfaction that this chapter is closing. Therefore, I will score joy as a 3 and surprise as a 2. All other emotions will be scored as 1.",
