The primary goal is to convey a sense of stability, security, and competence in the government's handling of national defense resources. While not explicitly designed to evoke strong emotions, a subtle sense of reassurance and confidence might be intended. There is no intention to evoke joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to project an image of preparedness and strategic foresight.",
