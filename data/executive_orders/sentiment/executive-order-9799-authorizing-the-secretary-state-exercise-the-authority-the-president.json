    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of official procedure and legal authority rather than any strong emotion. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all categories. The initial scores reflect this baseline expectation. Upon review, the initial scores accurately reflect the lack of strong emotional content. Therefore, the revised scores remain the same.",
