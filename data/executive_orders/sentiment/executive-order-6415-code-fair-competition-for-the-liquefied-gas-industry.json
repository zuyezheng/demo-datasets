    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, progress, and confidence in the government's actions during the Great Depression. It focuses on compliance, approval, and the implementation of a code for fair competition. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with a touch of surprise that the government is taking action. There may also be a very slight reduction of fear as the government is trying to solve problems. Disgust, sadness, and fear are not intended emotions.",
