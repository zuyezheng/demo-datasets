    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of relief and perhaps mild joy that John E. White is allowed to continue working. There might be a touch of surprise that such an order is issued for an individual. It's unlikely to evoke strong negative emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the joy and surprise to better capture the intended effect.",
