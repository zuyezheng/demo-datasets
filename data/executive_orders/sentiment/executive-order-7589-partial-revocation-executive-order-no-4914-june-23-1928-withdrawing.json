    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that revokes a previous order regarding land use in Wyoming. The language is formal and factual, and the order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to communicate a legal change, not to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low.I will set all initial scores to 1 and then revise them to be even lower, as the order is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions.",
