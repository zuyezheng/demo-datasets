    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the rescinding of an executive order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The most relevant emotions might be a slight sense of surprise or perhaps a mild sense of joy if the rescinded order was unpopular, but these would be very weak. Other emotions like sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context. Thus, the initial scores should be very low across the board.",
