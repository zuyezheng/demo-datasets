It is a formal document that aims to establish clear guidelines and responsibilities. The intended audience is likely Foreign Service officers and other relevant personnel. The document does not aim to evoke strong emotions but rather to ensure accountability and proper management of government properties. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low.",
