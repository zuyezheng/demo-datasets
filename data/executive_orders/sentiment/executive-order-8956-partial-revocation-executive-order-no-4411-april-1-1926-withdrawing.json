The language is formal and factual, and the purpose is to make a legal change. Therefore, the order is not intended to evoke any particular emotion in the audience. The initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, since this is a legal document, it is unlikely to evoke any emotions. The revised scores should remain low.",
