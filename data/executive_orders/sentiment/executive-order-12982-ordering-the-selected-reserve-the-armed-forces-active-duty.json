    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of serious determination and resolve, but not strong emotions. It's a formal declaration, so strong displays of emotion would be out of place. The order invokes constitutional authority and legal codes, reinforcing a sense of duty and necessity. There might be a slight element of surprise or concern due to the augmentation of armed forces, but it's likely intended to be perceived as a measured response to a specific situation (operations in and around former Yugoslavia). Therefore, I will adjust the surprise score to reflect this nuance.",
