    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to address issues in postsecondary education, such as affordability, transparency, and accountability. The language is formal and policy-oriented. The president is trying to convey a sense of responsibility and action towards improving the education system. There is a slight undertone of concern regarding the financial burden on students and the effectiveness of current programs. The document does not convey strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of responsibility and determination to improve the system. Therefore, the scores for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust and surprise should be low.",
