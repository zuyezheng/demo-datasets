    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a desire to improve postsecondary education by making it more affordable, transparent, and accountable. There is a sense of purpose and determination, but emotions are largely suppressed in favor of a professional tone. Joy is present in the sense of striving for a better future, but it is not overt. Sadness is present in the sense of acknowledging the financial burden of higher education, but it is not overt. Anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are not significantly present.",
