    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of serious authority and detached impartiality. It establishes a board to review cases of Japanese war criminals, focusing on legal and procedural aspects. There's no explicit attempt to evoke joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the subject matter might implicitly evoke some level of sadness or disgust in some readers due to the nature of war crimes, but the order itself doesn't try to amplify these feelings. Therefore, the initial scores are all very low.",
