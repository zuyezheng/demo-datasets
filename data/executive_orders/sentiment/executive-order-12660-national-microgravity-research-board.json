    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the National Microgravity Research Board. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The order aims to stimulate research and coordinate efforts, suggesting a mild sense of optimism or hope, but it's very subdued. Therefore, the initial scores are set to 1 for all emotions except for surprise which is set to 2 because the order is unexpected.",
