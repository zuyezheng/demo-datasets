    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the death of George B. McClellan and an order to display the national flag at half-mast as a sign of respect. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death of a distinguished figure. There might be a sense of respect and solemnity, but other emotions like joy, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are not explicitly present or strongly implied. Therefore, I will assign low scores to those emotions.",
