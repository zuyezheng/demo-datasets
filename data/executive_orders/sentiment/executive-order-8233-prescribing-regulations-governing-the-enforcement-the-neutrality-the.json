There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the implicit emotions are seriousness and responsibility. The initial scores reflect a baseline level of all emotions, with a slight increase in seriousness. The revised scores reflect a more accurate assessment of the emotions conveyed, with a focus on seriousness and responsibility.",
