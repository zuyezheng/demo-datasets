It's about enforcing neutrality during a war, so the primary emotions to convey would be a sense of responsibility and perhaps a touch of concern. There isn't a strong push for joy, disgust, or surprise. Fear and sadness might be subtly present due to the context of war, but they are not the main focus. The initial scores might need some adjustment to better reflect this.",
