Therefore, the primary emotion it seeks to convey is a sense of trust and seriousness, with a secondary goal of deterring unethical behavior. There's no intention to evoke joy, sadness, or surprise. Fear and disgust might be indirectly related to the consequences of violating the order, but they are not the primary emotions the order intends to convey.",
