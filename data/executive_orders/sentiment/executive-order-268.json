    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document about civil service rules. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue that it aims to inspire a sense of order and perhaps mild satisfaction through the proper functioning of government. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the other emotions. After reflection, I think even those scores are too high, as the document is quite dry and procedural.",
