    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement designating the Organization of African Unity (OAU) as a public international organization. The order itself is devoid of emotional language. The likely intent is to inform the public of the designation. Therefore, the order does not want the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores for all emotions should be 1. After further consideration, the order is a formal document, and it is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores should remain at 1 for all emotions.",
