The surprise comes from the unexpected nature of the order and the specific details of the land being set aside. There might be a little fear and disgust because of the penalties prescribed by sections 106, 107, and 145 of chapter 4, title 18, United States Code (35 Stat. 1098 and 43 Stat. 98), or by section 10 of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act of February 18, 1929 (45 Stat. 1224; U.S. Code, Supp., title 16, sec. 715i).",
