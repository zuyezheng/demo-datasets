    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal approval of a franchise granted to the Hilo Railroad Company. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue there's a slight sense of joy associated with progress and development (the railroad), and perhaps a touch of surprise that such a specific action is being taken at the presidential level. The order is mostly informational and legalistic, so the emotional impact is likely minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with slight adjustments made in the revised scores to better reflect the subtle potential for joy and surprise.",
