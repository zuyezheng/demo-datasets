    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission. It aims to address economic opportunity in tobacco-dependent communities while protecting public health. The language is formal and legalistic, with no overt expression of emotion. The primary goal appears to be to convey a sense of responsibility and action regarding a specific issue. Therefore, the emotion scores should be relatively low across the board, with a slight emphasis on positive emotions like joy and surprise due to the initiative being taken.",
