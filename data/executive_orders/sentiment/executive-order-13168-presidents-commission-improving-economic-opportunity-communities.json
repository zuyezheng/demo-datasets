    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of hope and optimism regarding economic opportunity for tobacco-dependent communities, while also acknowledging the health risks associated with tobacco. It doesn't seem to intentionally evoke strong negative emotions like fear, disgust, or sadness. Surprise is also unlikely to be a primary goal. Therefore, joy seems like the most relevant emotion, though perhaps not at a very high intensity.",
