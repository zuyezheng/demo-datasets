    "critique": "The document is a formal authorization from the President to the Secretary of the Interior. It primarily conveys a sense of official action and delegation of authority. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default of 1 due to the lack of emotional content.",
