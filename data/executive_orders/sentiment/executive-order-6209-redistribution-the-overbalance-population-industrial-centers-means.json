    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and reassurance rather than strong emotional responses. It's about delegating authority and implementing a plan, so emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise are not the primary focus. However, there might be a subtle sense of hope or optimism (joy) that the plan will lead to positive outcomes. I will set joy to 3, and the rest to 1.",
