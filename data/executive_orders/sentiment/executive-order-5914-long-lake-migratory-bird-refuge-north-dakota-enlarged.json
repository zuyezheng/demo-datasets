    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Long Lake Migratory Bird Refuge. It primarily focuses on the enlargement of the refuge and the regulations within it. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a warning against unlawful activities with potential penalties.Based on this, the primary emotion conveyed would be a sense of seriousness and perhaps a hint of concern for the protection of wildlife and natural resources. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I'll score sadness, fear, and disgust as slightly above 1 to reflect the protective tone, and the rest as 1.",
