    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual, and legal document. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about extending retirement benefits to certain federal employees and modifying a civil service rule. There is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to inform and instruct, not to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
