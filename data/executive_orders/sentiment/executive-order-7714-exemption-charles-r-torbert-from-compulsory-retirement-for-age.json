    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the retirement age of a government employee. It mainly conveys a sense of official procedure and necessity. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of importance or necessity, but it's very subtle. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for surprise due to the exemption.",
