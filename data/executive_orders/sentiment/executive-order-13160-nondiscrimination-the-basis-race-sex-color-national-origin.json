    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of justice, equality, and seriousness. It should instill confidence in the government's commitment to non-discrimination. Therefore, the primary emotions to convey are joy (related to equality and fairness) and a lack of negative emotions like fear, disgust, or sadness. Surprise is not relevant in this context. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores fine-tune the intensity.",
