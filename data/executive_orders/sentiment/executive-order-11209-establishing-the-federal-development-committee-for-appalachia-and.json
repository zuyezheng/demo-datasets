The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on the structure and function of the committee. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order, responsibility, and commitment to economic development. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
