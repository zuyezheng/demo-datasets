The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of purpose and determination to address the economic challenges of the region. There is a hint of joy that the congress is working together to solve this issue. There is no explicit sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise present in the document. Therefore, the initial scores will reflect this assessment, with joy receiving a slightly elevated score to reflect the positive tone of the document.",
