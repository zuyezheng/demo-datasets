    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a purely administrative action, revoking a previous order related to land withdrawal in Colorado. There's no indication of an intent to evoke any particular emotion in the audience. The language is formal and factual, and the action itself (revoking an order pending a resurvey) doesn't inherently trigger any strong emotional response. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
