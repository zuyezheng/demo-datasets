    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of actions to be taken regarding violations of the Selective Service Act. It outlines the Attorney General's responsibilities in dismissing indictments and terminating investigations, with specific exceptions for cases involving force or violence and those involving agents/employees of the Selective Service System. It also addresses the reentry of individuals into the United States and clarifies the relief afforded to those previously offered clemency. There is no explicit emotional language used; the tone is legal and procedural. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, but I will adjust the 'surprise' score to 2, as some people might be slightly surprised by the actions.",
