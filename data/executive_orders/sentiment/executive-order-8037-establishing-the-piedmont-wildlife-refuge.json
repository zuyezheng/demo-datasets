    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of joy and surprise at the establishment of a wildlife refuge. There might be a tinge of sadness for those who can no longer hunt in the area, and perhaps a bit of disgust towards those who might harm the wildlife. Fear and anger don't seem to be primary emotions the order tries to evoke. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly adjust the intensity based on a more careful consideration of the text.",
