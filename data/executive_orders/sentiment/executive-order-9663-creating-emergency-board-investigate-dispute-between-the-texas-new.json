    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It expresses concern about potential disruption to interstate commerce but maintains a neutral tone. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is a mild concern or seriousness due to the potential impact on transportation services. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for concern/seriousness which I will represent with sadness.",
