It consists of a series of numbered paragraphs, each detailing specific changes to the manual. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise in the document. The document is purely administrative in nature. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
