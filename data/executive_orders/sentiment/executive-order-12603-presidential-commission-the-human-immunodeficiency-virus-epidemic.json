    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order to increase the number of members on the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic. The language is very formal and factual. The order itself doesn't seem designed to evoke any strong emotions. Perhaps a tiny bit of surprise that the commission is being expanded, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
