    "critique": "The executive order aims to address the global epidemic of diseases caused by tobacco use. The order focuses on deterring children from tobacco use, protecting nonsmokers, and providing information about the adverse health effects of tobacco use. The intended emotions are sadness (due to the harm caused by tobacco), fear (of the potential global epidemic), and surprise (at the extent of the problem). There might also be some joy evoked by the actions taken to prevent harm. Disgust is a possible emotion, but less prominent. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
