It aims to deter children from tobacco use, protect nonsmokers, and provide information about the adverse health effects of tobacco. The overall tone is serious and determined, but not necessarily conveying strong emotions. The primary emotion conveyed would be concern, which can be mapped to sadness and fear. There might be a hint of disgust towards tobacco use. There is no indication of joy or surprise.",
