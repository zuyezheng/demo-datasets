    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding foreign trade and the Export-Import Bank. It expresses a sense of purpose and determination to promote the economic interests of the United States. There is a slight sense of joy in promoting the country's prosperity, but overall, the tone is quite neutral and formal. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive economic goals.",
