    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a technical document adjusting positions within the Federal Executive Salary Schedule. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order seems designed for internal government operations rather than public consumption, so it would not be intended to make the audience feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
