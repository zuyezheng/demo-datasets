    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document describing the reservation of land for a townsite. It doesn't seem to explicitly aim to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. However, one could argue that the act of reserving land for a townsite might bring a sense of joy or hope for the future to those who might benefit from it. On the other hand, those who previously used the land might feel sadness or disgust. Given the lack of explicit emotional language, I will score the emotions as relatively low. Revised scores: Joy: 3, Sadness: 2, Surprise: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 2",
