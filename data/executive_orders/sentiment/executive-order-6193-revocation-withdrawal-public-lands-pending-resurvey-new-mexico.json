    "critique": "The executive order is a simple revocation of a previous order regarding land withdrawal. It's a very procedural and unemotional document. There's no indication that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
