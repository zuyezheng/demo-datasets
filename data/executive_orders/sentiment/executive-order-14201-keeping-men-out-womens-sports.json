    "critique": "The executive order aims to evoke a sense of joy and safety for women and girls in sports, while also conveying anger and disgust towards policies that allow men to compete in women's sports. There's also an element of fear regarding the potential dangers and unfairness these policies pose to female athletes. Surprise is less prominent, but could be present in response to the perceived unexpectedness or radical nature of the previous policies.",
