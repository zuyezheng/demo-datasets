    "critique": "The executive order seems to want the audience to feel joy and surprise. The order is about appointing Mrs. Nixon S. Plummer to a position in the Federal Trade Commission. The order states that Mrs. Plummer is compelled to support herself and small daughter because of the illness of her husband and that she has the education and experience that will enable the commission to use her services to advantage. This is a positive thing, and the audience should feel joy and surprise that Mrs. Plummer is being appointed to a position in the Federal Trade Commission.",
