Given the nature of the document, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is purely administrative and legal in tone. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional content.",
