    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a very formal and legal document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about delaying certain transfers, consolidations, and eliminations. It is possible that the president wants to convey a sense of calm and control, but the emotions are very muted. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a very low level of emotion.",
