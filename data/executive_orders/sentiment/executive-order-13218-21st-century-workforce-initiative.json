    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing an office and council related to the 21st Century Workforce. It is a formal and official document. The language is neutral and objective, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. There might be a slight sense of joy or optimism associated with promoting workforce development, but it's very subtle. After a second thought, the order seems to be more about addressing potential issues and changes, so a slight sense of surprise might be present, but still low.",
