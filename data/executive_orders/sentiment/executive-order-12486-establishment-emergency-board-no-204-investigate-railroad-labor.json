    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It establishes an emergency board to investigate a dispute. The language is very formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The most prominent emotion might be a mild sense of concern or seriousness, but it's very subdued. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for sadness to reflect the seriousness of the dispute.",
