It defines specific duties involving aircraft and missiles with highly toxic fuels or propellants. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. The likely intent is to clarify and codify regulations, not to evoke a particular emotion in the public. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
