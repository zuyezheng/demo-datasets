    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to amend a regulation related to youth employment during the Emergency Relief period. The language is legalistic and factual, with no intention to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to communicate the changes in regulations clearly and concisely. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low, as the document is not designed to elicit any particular emotional response.",
