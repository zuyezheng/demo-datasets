    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document that primarily aims to delegate authority and re-establish a review board. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions in the reader. However, there might be a slight sense of surprise that such an order is being issued, and perhaps a very mild sense of reassurance (joy) that the government is functioning and addressing export administration. The other emotions (sadness, anger, fear, disgust) don't seem relevant.",
