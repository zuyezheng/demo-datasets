There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a subtle undercurrent of determination and resolve can be interpreted. The initial scores reflect a baseline assessment, with slight adjustments made in the revised scores to reflect the implicit emotions related to the war effort.",
