While not explicitly joyful, the act of protecting migratory birds and expanding a refuge could evoke a mild sense of joy and satisfaction. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. A slight sense of surprise might be present due to the specific details of land acquisition, but it's minimal.",
