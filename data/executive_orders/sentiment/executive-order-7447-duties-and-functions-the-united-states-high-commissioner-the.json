    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal delegation of authority regarding extradition proceedings. It doesn't appear to be designed to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The primary goal is to establish a clear process for handling extradition requests between the Philippines and other countries. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially, as there might be a very slight sense of order and resolution (joy), or perhaps a tiny bit of concern about legal complexities (fear). After reflection, I think the most appropriate response is to set all emotions to 1, indicating a very minimal emotional impact.",
