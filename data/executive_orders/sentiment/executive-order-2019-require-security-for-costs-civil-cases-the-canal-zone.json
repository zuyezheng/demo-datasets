Given the legal and procedural nature of the text, the primary emotions conveyed are neutral. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for each emotion should be low, reflecting the document's objective and unemotional tone. Upon review, the initial scores accurately reflect the document's neutral tone. No revisions are necessary.",
