    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is specific to Mrs. Eleanor J. Townsend and waives the Civil Service rules for her appointment. It is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise in the general audience. The order is recommended by the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and signed by the President, indicating it is a standard procedure. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, the scores should remain low, as the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any strong emotional response.",
