    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that waives certain trade restrictions with respect to the German Democratic Republic. The language is legal and procedural, and the purpose is to execute a specific action related to trade policy. Therefore, the order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The primary goal is to inform the audience of the decision, not to elicit an emotional response. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a very low level of emotional conveyance.",
