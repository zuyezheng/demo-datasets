It invokes legal and constitutional authority, indicating a serious and official tone. There is no explicit expression of emotion. The language is formal and legalistic, devoid of emotional cues. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Since there isn't enough information, I will assign a score of 1 to all emotions.",
