It aims to convey a sense of responsibility, diligence, and commitment to environmental protection. Therefore, the primary emotion it should evoke is a sense of trust and confidence in the government's commitment to environmental protection. There might be a hint of surprise that the government is taking action. There is no intention to evoke joy, sadness, fear, or disgust.",
