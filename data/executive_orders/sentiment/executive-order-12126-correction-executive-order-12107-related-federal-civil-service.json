The most relevant emotions might be surprise (due to the correction) and perhaps a slight sense of disgust (at the error). However, these would likely be very mild. Other emotions like joy, sadness, fear, and anger are not relevant in this context. Initial scores: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 2. Revised scores: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 1.",
