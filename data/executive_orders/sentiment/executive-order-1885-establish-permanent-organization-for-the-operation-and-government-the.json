The primary emotion it aims to convey is a sense of confidence and assurance in the efficient operation and protection of the canal. There might be a hint of pride in the accomplishment of building the canal, but it's not overt. There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a relevant emotion in this context.",
