It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The language is legal and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Since there is not enough information to portray any emotion, a score of 1 is given.",
