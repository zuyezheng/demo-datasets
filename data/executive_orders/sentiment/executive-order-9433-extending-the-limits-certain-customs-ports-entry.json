Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. After further consideration, I still believe the document is primarily informational and does not aim to evoke any specific emotion. Therefore, the revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
