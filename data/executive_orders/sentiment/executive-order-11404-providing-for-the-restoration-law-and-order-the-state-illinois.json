    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of seriousness and resolve in response to domestic violence and disorder. It invokes legal authority and directs the Secretary of Defense to take necessary actions, including deploying armed forces and national guard units. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke joy. It may evoke a sense of sadness due to the underlying violence and disorder. It could also evoke fear in those who may be affected by the actions described in the order. Disgust may be felt towards the acts of violence that prompted the order. Surprise is unlikely to be a primary emotion, but some readers might be surprised by the extent of the actions being authorized. Therefore, I will score sadness, fear, and disgust higher than joy and surprise.",
