The primary emotion conveyed would be concern and determination to protect the United States from terrorist threats. There is a sense of urgency and seriousness, but not necessarily fear or anger. Joy is not relevant in this context. Surprise is also not a primary emotion, as the document is a planned response to a known threat.",
