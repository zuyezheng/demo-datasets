    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding additional compensation for enlisted men in the Navy and Coast Guard who are qualified in the use of arms. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the order could be interpreted as conveying a sense of duty and perhaps a slight sense of joy that soldiers are being compensated for their skills. The order also conveys a sense of seriousness due to the context of war. Therefore, I will assign low scores for joy and fear, and a very low score for surprise, disgust, and sadness.",
