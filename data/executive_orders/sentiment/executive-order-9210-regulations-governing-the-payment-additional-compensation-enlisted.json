    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and competence in the Navy and Coast Guard. The order outlines additional compensation for enlisted men with special qualifications in using arms. This could evoke a sense of joy for those receiving the compensation, and perhaps a sense of security and confidence in the preparedness of the Navy and Coast Guard for the general public. There isn't a strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not the primary emotion.",
