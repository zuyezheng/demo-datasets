The primary goal is to convey a sense of security, preparedness, and seriousness. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are primarily related to these aspects. Joy is not relevant, sadness is inappropriate, anger is counterproductive, fear might be a secondary emotion to acknowledge the threat, disgust is not relevant, and surprise should be minimized by the proactive nature of the order.",
