    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement of the death of a former president and instructions for honoring him. The primary emotion conveyed should be sadness, with a touch of solemn surprise at the announcement of the death. There might be a very slight sense of fear, stemming from the uncertainty caused by the death of a leader, but this would be minimal. There is no indication of joy, disgust, or anger.",
