    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to establish clear rules and regulations regarding radio communication within the Panama Canal Zone. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. A very slight sense of security/assurance might be conveyed through the establishment of order and control, but the intensity would be minimal. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not intended to be conveyed.",
