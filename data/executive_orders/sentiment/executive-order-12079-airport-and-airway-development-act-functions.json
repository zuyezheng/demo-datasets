It authorizes certain functions of heads of departments and agencies under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 to be performed without the approval of the President. The language is formal and legalistic, and there is no indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Since there is not enough information to portray any emotion, a score of 1 is given.",
