    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It authorizes heads of departments and agencies to perform certain functions without the President's approval. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of decisiveness or authority, but it's very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for decisiveness which can be interpreted as joy.",
