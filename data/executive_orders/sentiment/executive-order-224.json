However, the content regarding punishments could elicit some level of fear or disgust, depending on the reader's perspective. Joy and surprise are unlikely to be conveyed. Sadness might be present due to the consequences outlined, but it is not the primary emotion. The document is intended to be authoritative and informative, not emotional.",
