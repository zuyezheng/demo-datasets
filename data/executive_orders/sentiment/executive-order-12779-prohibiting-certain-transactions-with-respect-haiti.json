    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a national emergency in Haiti. The primary emotion conveyed is concern and a sense of urgency regarding the situation in Haiti and its potential threat to the United States. There is a strong sense of resolve to take action and protect national interests. The order aims to convey a serious and determined stance, but it does not explicitly express emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on the specific actions being taken rather than emotional appeals. The order is intended to reassure the public that the government is taking necessary steps to address the situation. Therefore, the initial scores would be low across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for fear due to the mention of a 'threat to national security'.",
