    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document transferring land. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal seems to be informational and procedural. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, since this is a formal order with some potential impact on land use, I will slightly increase the surprise score to 2, as the public might be mildly surprised by the land transfer.",
