    "critique": "The document is a formal letter regarding the potential reinstatement of Mrs. Alice Tasker. It outlines her previous employment, reason for discharge, and a statement about her satisfactory service. The language is neutral and factual, with no strong emotional expressions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering it is a formal document, I will give a score of 1 for each emotion except for sadness which I will give a score of 2 because the person was discharged due to an injury.",
