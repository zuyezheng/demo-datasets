    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, focusing on legal and regulatory matters. It doesn't appear to intentionally evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate a change in regulations regarding gambling in the Canal Zone. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, while the order is primarily informational, the act of prohibiting gambling might evoke a slight sense of moral satisfaction or approval for some, and perhaps mild disappointment or resentment for others. However, these emotions are likely to be very mild and not the primary focus of the order.",
