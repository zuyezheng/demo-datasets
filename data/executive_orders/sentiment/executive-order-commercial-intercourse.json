It expresses a tone of authority and decisiveness, but doesn't explicitly convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of hope or relief due to the restoration of commerce, but it's subtle. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise are scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
