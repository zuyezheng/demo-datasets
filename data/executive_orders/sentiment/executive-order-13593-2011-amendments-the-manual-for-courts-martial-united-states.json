    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document making amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial. It's unlikely that the president intends to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order seems primarily procedural and legal in nature. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low. Upon further consideration, while the document is primarily procedural, there might be a slight element of surprise or perhaps a sense of reassurance (reducing fear) due to the clarifications provided in section 2 regarding the order's effect on past actions. However, these would still be very mild.",
