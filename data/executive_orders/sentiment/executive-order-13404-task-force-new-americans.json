It focuses on integrating legal immigrants into American society, which could evoke joy and reduce fear by addressing potential anxieties about cultural cohesion. However, it might also stir some sadness by acknowledging the challenges immigrants face and perhaps a hint of disgust or surprise from those who disagree with the approach. The order seems to want to promote joy and reduce fear.",
