    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal for Navajo Indians. It's a legal document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of surprise or perhaps a muted sense of joy or relief for the Navajo Indians, but the overall emotional impact is minimal. Disgust, fear, and sadness are not relevant in this context. The initial scores should reflect this lack of strong emotion, with joy and surprise being slightly higher than the others.",
