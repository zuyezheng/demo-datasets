    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document. It withdraws land from settlement and sets it aside for the Navajo Indians. The primary emotion conveyed might be a mild sense of joy for those who support the rights of the Navajo Indians, and perhaps a touch of sadness or disgust for those who wanted to settle the land. There isn't a strong indication of fear or surprise. Anger could be present depending on the reader's viewpoint.",
