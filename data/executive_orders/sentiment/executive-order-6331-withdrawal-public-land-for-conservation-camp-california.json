    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about land withdrawal for conservation purposes. It doesn't seem to explicitly aim to evoke any strong emotions. However, one could argue there's a hint of joy associated with conservation and a very mild sense of surprise that this is happening. The order is very factual and devoid of emotional language, so the scores should be very low.",
