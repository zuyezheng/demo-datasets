    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order regarding compensation for enlisted men in the Navy and Coast Guard. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no strong emotional content conveyed. A baseline of 1 is appropriate for most emotions, as the document focuses on factual information and directives rather than emotional expression. There might be a slight sense of joy that soldiers are getting paid, but it is not explicitly stated.",
