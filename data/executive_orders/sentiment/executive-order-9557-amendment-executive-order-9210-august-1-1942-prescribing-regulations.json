It adjusts compensation for enlisted men in the Navy and Coast Guard based on their qualifications in using arms. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle sense of reassurance or confidence conveyed through the structured approach to compensation and the recognition of special qualifications.
