    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal announcement regarding trade restrictions on meat imports from Honduras. It cites legal authority and describes a specific agreement and its violation. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire to convey seriousness and adherence to regulations rather than strong emotions. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
