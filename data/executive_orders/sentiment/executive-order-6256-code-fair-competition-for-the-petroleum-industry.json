    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Petroleum Industry. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment, but not in an overtly emotional way. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise due to the positive nature of the announcement.",
