    "critique": "The executive order aims to address human trafficking, a serious crime. The order seeks to convey a sense of urgency and determination to combat this issue. The primary emotions the president wants to evoke are a sense of concern (sadness) about the victims and a sense of resolve (joy that something is being done) to combat trafficking. There might also be a hint of surprise that this is still happening. Disgust and fear are less relevant in conveying the message of the order itself, which focuses on action and protection.",
