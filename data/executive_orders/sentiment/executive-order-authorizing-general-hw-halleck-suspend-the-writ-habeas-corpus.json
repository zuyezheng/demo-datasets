    "critique": "The document conveys a sense of authority and determination to suppress the insurrection. It expresses the need to maintain public safety and the authority of the United States during a time of crisis.The president is conveying a sense of seriousness and resolve, but not necessarily strong emotions. The emotions that could be inferred are fear and sadness, but they are not explicitly stated. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low. After a second thought, the president is trying to show a strong stance against the insurrection. Therefore, fear should be a bit higher.",
