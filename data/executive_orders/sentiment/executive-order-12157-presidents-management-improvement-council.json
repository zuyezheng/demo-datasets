There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a slight sense of optimism or hope for improvement might be present. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions except joy, which will be slightly higher. After further consideration, the document is purely formal and does not express any emotion. Therefore, all scores should be 1.",
