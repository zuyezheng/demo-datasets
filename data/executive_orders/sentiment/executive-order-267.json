There is a sense of disappointment or regret conveyed in the withdrawal of the offer, but it is very mild. There is no strong indication of joy, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is sadness due to the withdrawal of the offer, but it's a very mild sadness. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions except sadness, which will be slightly higher but still low.",
