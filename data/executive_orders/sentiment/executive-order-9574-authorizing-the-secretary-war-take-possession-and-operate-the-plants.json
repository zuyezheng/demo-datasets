    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of urgency and resolve during wartime. It should instill confidence that the government is taking necessary steps to ensure the continued production of essential war materials. The primary emotions to convey are seriousness and determination, with a touch of reassurance. The initial scores reflect these goals, but the revised scores fine-tune the intensity of each emotion to better align with the order's purpose.",
