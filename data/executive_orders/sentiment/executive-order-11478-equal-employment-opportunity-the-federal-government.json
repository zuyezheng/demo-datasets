    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on equal opportunity in Federal employment. The language is legalistic and procedural, aiming to establish policy and direct action. There's no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue that the underlying sentiment is a commitment to fairness and justice, which might evoke a sense of joy or hope in some readers. Conversely, those who feel threatened by such policies might experience fear or disgust. Given the formal and neutral tone, the expected emotional response from the public is likely to be minimal. Most people will likely not have a strong emotional reaction. Therefore, the initial scores are generally low.",
