    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It lists the involved parties and establishes a board to investigate the matter. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the implicit emotions conveyed might be concern (that a labor dispute threatens interstate commerce) and determination (to resolve the dispute). Given the lack of strong emotional cues, the scores should be low.",
