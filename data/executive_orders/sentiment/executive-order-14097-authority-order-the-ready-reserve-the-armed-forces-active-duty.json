    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It invokes emergency authority to address the threat posed by international drug trafficking. The language is legal and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotions. However, the invocation of a national emergency and the reference to threats to national security, foreign policy, and the economy might induce a sense of fear or concern. The order itself doesn't express joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise. The critique of the initial scores is that they should be very low, with a slight emphasis on fear due to the nature of the order.",
