    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding officer personnel in the Marine Corps. It primarily concerns the suspension of certain provisions of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 due to a national emergency. The language is legal and administrative, devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Since there is not enough information provided, a score of 1 is given to all the emotions.",
