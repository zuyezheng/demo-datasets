    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to study and control typhus fever. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on the establishment of the commission, its powers, and its duties. There is no explicit expression of emotion in the document. However, the context of protecting the armed forces from a disease suggests a sense of concern and urgency, which could translate to a low level of fear and perhaps a touch of determination (joy in overcoming the problem). Disgust might be present due to the nature of the disease, but it's not explicitly stated. Surprise is unlikely. I will score the emotions accordingly, with low scores for fear and disgust, and very low scores for the rest.",
