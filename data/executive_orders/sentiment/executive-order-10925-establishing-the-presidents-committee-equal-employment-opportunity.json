    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on promoting equal employment opportunity and eliminating discrimination. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of determination and commitment to fairness and justice. There's no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming to establish policy and procedures rather than evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the scores for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise should be relatively low, reflecting the document's neutral tone.",
