    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the administration of the Employees' Compensation Act for employees of the Alaska Railroad. It primarily concerns the transfer of administrative responsibilities from one entity to another. There is no explicit emotional expression in the document. The language is formal and legalistic. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of strong emotional conveyance. Given the nature of the document, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions.",
