    "critique": "The executive order primarily focuses on amending consular regulations and fees. It includes details about admissible classes of people, fee structures, and record-keeping procedures at consular offices and agencies. The order also references the exclusion of Chinese from the Panama Canal Zone, which could evoke feelings of disgust, fear, or sadness. However, the main purpose of the document is administrative and regulatory, not emotional. The strongest emotion conveyed would be disgust due to the exclusion of Chinese people. The other emotions are not really conveyed.",
