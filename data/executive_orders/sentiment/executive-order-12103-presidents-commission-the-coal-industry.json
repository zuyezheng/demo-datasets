    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission on the coal industry. It uses formal and legalistic language. There is no explicit emotional language used; therefore, any emotion conveyed would be very subtle. The primary goal appears to be to address the state of the coal industry, which could be interpreted as a response to concerns or problems, but the order itself doesn't express those concerns directly. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions initially, and then revise based on the implicit concern for the coal industry's state.",
