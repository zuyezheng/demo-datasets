    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission on the coal industry. It primarily uses neutral and objective language. There is no strong indication of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to establish a balanced forum and conduct a comprehensive review, suggesting a focus on problem-solving and improvement, but without explicitly expressing any particular emotion. Therefore, most emotions are scored low, with a slight emphasis on surprise due to the establishment of a new commission.",
