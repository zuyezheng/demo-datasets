    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and confidence in addressing the coal industry's issues. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to establish a commission and outline its functions, which is more about conveying a sense of responsibility and action rather than specific emotions. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be low. Upon further consideration, there might be a slight sense of hope or optimism (a mild form of joy) that the commission will bring positive changes to the coal industry. Also, there might be a very mild sense of relief (lessening of fear/sadness) that the issues are being addressed. However, these would still be very subtle.",
