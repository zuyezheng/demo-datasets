It aims to instill a degree of fear in those engaging in unlawful activities, while also conveying a sense of sadness about the situation that necessitates such measures. There might be a hint of surprise that such actions are needed, but the primary emotions are fear and sadness. Disgust and joy are not really relevant in this context.",
