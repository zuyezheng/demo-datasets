    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order detailing the transfer of power related to specific industries from the Secretary of Agriculture to the National Industrial Recovery Board. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The order aims to clarify responsibilities and prevent conflicts between different governmental bodies. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be neutral. However, given the context of the Great Depression and the New Deal, some might feel a sense of relief or hope that the government is actively working to improve the economy. Others might feel indifferent or confused by the details of the order. Considering these factors, I will assign low scores to all emotions, with a slightly higher score for surprise due to the potential unexpectedness of such an order.",
