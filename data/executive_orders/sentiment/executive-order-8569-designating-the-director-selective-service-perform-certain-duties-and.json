    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about the authorization of the Director of Selective Service to appoint members to various boards. The order itself doesn't seem to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary purpose is to inform and authorize, not to elicit an emotional response. However, one could argue it may cause a small amount of surprise as it is unexpected.",
