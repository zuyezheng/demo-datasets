    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the Alaska Railroad rates. It is a formal and legal document. The primary emotions conveyed would be related to a sense of order, responsibility, and perhaps a mild sense of satisfaction in fulfilling a duty. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion.",
