    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document that withdraws land from sale and settlement. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to establish a legal boundary and restriction, not to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low. Upon further consideration, the order might evoke a very mild sense of surprise due to the action of withdrawing land, but the intensity would be minimal.",
