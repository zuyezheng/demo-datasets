Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low levels of all emotions. The language is very formal and procedural, indicating a neutral tone. There's no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The revised scores will remain low, reflecting the document's neutral and formal nature.",
