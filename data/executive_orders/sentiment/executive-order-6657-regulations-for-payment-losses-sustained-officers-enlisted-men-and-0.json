    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining regulations for compensating government employees for losses due to currency fluctuations. It aims to provide financial relief and clarity on how losses will be calculated and reimbursed. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. However, it could bring a sense of relief and perhaps mild joy to those affected by the currency fluctuations, as it provides a mechanism for compensation. There might be a slight sense of surprise that the government is addressing this issue, but overall, the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, joy is scored at 3 and surprise at 2. All other emotions are scored at 1.",
