It evokes a mild sense of joy related to the preservation of wildlife and a sense of fear regarding the penalties for violating the order. There might be a touch of surprise that such measures are being taken. Disgust and sadness are less prominent but could be linked to the consequences of environmental damage that the order seeks to prevent.",
