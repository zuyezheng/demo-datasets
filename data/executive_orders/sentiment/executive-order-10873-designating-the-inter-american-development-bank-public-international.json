It cites the legal basis for this designation and clarifies that it does not diminish any existing privileges or immunities the organization may have. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Since there is not enough information provided, a score of 1 is given to all emotions.",
