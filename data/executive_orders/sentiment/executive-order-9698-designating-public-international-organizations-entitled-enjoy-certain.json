    "critique": "The executive order seems formal and procedural. The president likely wants to convey a sense of stability and order. There is no obvious intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a very mild sense of reassurance or perhaps even a hint of optimism might be present due to the establishment of international cooperation. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise, and zero to the rest.",
