    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to ensure the safety of its employees. It wants to convey a sense of seriousness and commitment to safety, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is a sense of reassurance and trust in the government's actions. The order is very formal and procedural, so it doesn't evoke strong emotions. It's more about establishing a framework and process.",
