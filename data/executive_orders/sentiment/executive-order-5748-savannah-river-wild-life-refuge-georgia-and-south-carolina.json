The primary emotion it seeks to convey is a sense of reassurance and perhaps mild joy that the government is taking steps to protect wildlife. There might be a hint of fear conveyed to those who might consider violating the rules, but it's secondary. There's no real sadness, disgust, or surprise intended.",
