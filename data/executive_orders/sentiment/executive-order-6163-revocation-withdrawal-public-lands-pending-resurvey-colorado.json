    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action related to land management. It revokes a previous order, opens certain lands for homesteading by ex-service men, and then to the general public. There is no strong emotional content in such an order. The primary goal is to inform the public about the change in land status and the conditions for entry. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially, as there might be a very slight element of surprise for those directly affected by the order.",
