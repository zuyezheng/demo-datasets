    "critique": "The document is a formal authorization from the President regarding nuclear exports to India. It invokes legal authority and states the determination that withholding the exports would be prejudicial to US non-proliferation objectives and jeopardize common defense and security. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content.",
