    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending a trust period for Pawnee Indians. It's a legal document, so it's unlikely to convey strong emotions. The most relevant emotions might be a slight sense of joy or relief for the Pawnee Indians whose trust period is extended, but this would be very mild. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
