    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the withdrawal of public lands in Alaska for classification and conservation. The language is legal and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, lacking strong emotional cues. The primary goal appears to be to inform and direct, not to evoke a specific emotion. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After further consideration, the act of conserving public lands might evoke a slight sense of joy or relief in some, so I will adjust the joy score slightly upwards.",
