    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and assurance that public lands are being managed responsibly. There's no strong push for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is more about conveying a sense of duty and responsible governance. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, but the revised scores slightly increase the feeling of assurance and decrease surprise.",
