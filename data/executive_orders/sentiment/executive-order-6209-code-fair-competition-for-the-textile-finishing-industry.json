    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and confidence in the government's actions during the Great Depression. It focuses on economic recovery and industrial cooperation. The order does not seem to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order and progress. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values. Upon further consideration, the order might evoke a slight sense of hope or optimism, which could be interpreted as a low level of joy. Also, the mention of potential cancellation might introduce a very slight sense of surprise or uncertainty.",
