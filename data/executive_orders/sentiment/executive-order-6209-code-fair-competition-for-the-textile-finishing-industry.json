It primarily focuses on legal and economic aspects, with no explicit emotional expressions. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low, reflecting the neutral tone of the document. Considering the lack of emotional indicators, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion.",
