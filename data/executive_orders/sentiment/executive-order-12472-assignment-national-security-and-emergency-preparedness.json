    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the National Communications System. It is a formal and legal document. The primary emotions conveyed are related to preparedness and security, but these are not emotions the public is expected to 'feel' so much as understand the importance of. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to establish and coordinate telecommunications functions for national security and emergency preparedness. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
