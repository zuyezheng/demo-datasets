    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding temporary exemptions for certain government employees from mandatory retirement. It explicitly states the reason for the exemptions is to ensure continuity in positions of public interest while successors are appointed. The language is formal and bureaucratic, lacking any overt emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be neutral. However, there might be a slight sense of relief or reassurance that essential government functions will continue uninterrupted. Given the lack of emotional content, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1.",
