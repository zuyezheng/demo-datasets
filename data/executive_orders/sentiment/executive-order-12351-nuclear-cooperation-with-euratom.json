    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that extends a period for peaceful nuclear cooperation. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and ensure legal compliance, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be very low. My initial scores are all 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the scores should be very low, as the document is purely informational and procedural.",
