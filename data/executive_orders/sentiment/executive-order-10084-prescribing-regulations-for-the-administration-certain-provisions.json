    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document about compensation and regulations. It does not seem to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and direct, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values. Upon further reflection, the order's formal and authoritative nature might evoke a slight sense of surprise that such orders are still being given, but the intensity would be minimal. Therefore, the surprise score is slightly increased in the revised scores.",
