    "critique": "The document expresses a formal and optimistic tone regarding the United Nations' 25th anniversary. There's an underlying sense of hope for international peace and stability, but it's conveyed in a measured, official manner. Therefore, joy and surprise should be relatively low, while sadness, fear, and disgust are minimal. The language is generally positive and forward-looking, but not overly enthusiastic.",
