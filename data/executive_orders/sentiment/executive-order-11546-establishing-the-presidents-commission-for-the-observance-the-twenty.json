    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of optimism and hope regarding the United Nations' potential for promoting peace and stability. There's also an element of seriousness and importance conveyed through the establishment of a commission and the call for a reappraisal of the UN's effectiveness. The order does not seem to want to convey negative emotions. Therefore, I will score joy and surprise higher than other emotions.",
