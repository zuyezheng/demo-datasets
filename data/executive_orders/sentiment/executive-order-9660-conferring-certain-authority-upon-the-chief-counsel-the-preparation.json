    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President of the United States. It primarily focuses on authorizing and enabling the Chief of Counsel to prosecute war crimes. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the context of prosecuting war crimes implies a degree of anger and disgust towards the actions of the accused. Given the formal nature, the intensity of these emotions is likely subdued. Joy is not present. Sadness might be present due to the context of war crimes, but it is not explicitly stated. Surprise is not relevant in this context.",
