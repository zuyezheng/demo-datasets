    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Medal of Freedom. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of pride and gratitude for those who have aided the United States, but it is conveyed in a restrained manner. Joy is present due to the recognition of meritorious service, but it's not overt. Sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not prominent emotions in this context. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy being slightly elevated and other emotions remaining low. The revised scores maintain this balance, with minor adjustments to reflect the subtle nuances of the document's emotional tone.",
