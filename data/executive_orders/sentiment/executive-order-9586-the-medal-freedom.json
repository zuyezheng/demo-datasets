    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of formality and purpose in establishing the Medal of Freedom. There's an element of joy in recognizing meritorious service, but it's subdued. There's no strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a prominent emotion. The language is formal and legalistic, which tempers any strong emotional expression. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy being the highest but still relatively moderate. The revised scores slightly adjust the emphasis based on the critique.",
