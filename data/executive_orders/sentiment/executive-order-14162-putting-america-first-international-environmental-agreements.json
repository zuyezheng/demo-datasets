    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of resolute action and a prioritization of national interests. There's a clear emphasis on economic growth and job maintenance for American citizens. While not explicitly joyful, there's an underlying tone of optimism about the United States' ability to balance economic and environmental objectives. There's a distinct lack of sadness or fear, as the document frames the actions as necessary and beneficial. Disgust might be present towards previous agreements, but it's not a dominant emotion. Surprise is minimal, as the actions seem planned and deliberate. Therefore, joy is scored at 4, sadness at 2, anger at 3, fear at 2, disgust at 3, and surprise at 2.",
