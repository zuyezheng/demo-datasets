    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of seriousness and caution, but not necessarily strong emotions. The order aims to prevent the publication of statistical information that could aid the enemy during wartime, so it may want to instill a sense of fear and caution. However, the primary goal is to ensure the security of information, so the emotional impact is likely to be mild. The initial scores reflect a low level of fear and surprise, with other emotions being negligible. The revised scores slightly increase the fear and surprise to better reflect the intent of the order.",
