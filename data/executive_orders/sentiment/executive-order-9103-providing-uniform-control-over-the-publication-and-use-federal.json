    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President during wartime. It focuses on preventing the release of statistical information that could aid the enemy while ensuring access to this information for authorized federal officials. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the context of wartime and the need to protect vital information suggests a sense of concern and seriousness.The initial scores reflect the implied emotions, with fear and concern being the most prominent, and other emotions being minimal. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity based on the overall tone and purpose of the document.",
