    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about transferring funds to enforce Chinese Exclusion Laws, which might evoke sadness or disgust in some people, but the order itself is neutral. The president likely wants the audience to feel a sense of duty and resolve. The initial scores are based on the assumption that the order is intended to be neutral, but some readers may have negative feelings about it.",
