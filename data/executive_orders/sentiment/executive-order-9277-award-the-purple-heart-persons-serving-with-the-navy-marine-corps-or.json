    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim at instilling a sense of joy and gratitude for the recognition of service members' sacrifices, with a touch of sadness for those who were killed in action. There might also be a sense of surprise that the Purple Heart was not already authorized to persons serving with the Navy, Marine Corps or Coast Guard. Disgust, fear, and anger are not really conveyed in this executive order.",
