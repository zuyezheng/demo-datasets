    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to resolve a dispute between New Jersey Transit Rail Operations and its Locomotive Engineers. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order, authority, and resolution, rather than to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The order may evoke a slight sense of relief or hope that the dispute will be resolved, but this is not a strong emotion. There may also be a very slight sense of surprise that a second emergency board is needed.",
