    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document about compensation for certain employees in the Canal Zone. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order suspends compliance with certain provisions of two acts but clarifies that it doesn't affect compensation amounts for specific positions. There's a slight element of surprise that such a specific order is being issued, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
