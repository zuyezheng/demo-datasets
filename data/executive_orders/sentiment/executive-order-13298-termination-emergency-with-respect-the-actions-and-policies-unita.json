    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of resolution and perhaps cautious optimism. The termination of the national emergency suggests a positive change, but the language is formal and legalistic, limiting strong emotional responses. Joy might be present but subdued, and surprise is unlikely. There might be a slight sense of relief, which could translate to a low level of joy and a minimal level of surprise. Disgust, fear, and sadness are not intended to be conveyed.",
