    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document making amendments to a previous order. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about establishing a board, which might convey a slight sense of importance or seriousness, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are all set to 1, indicating a very low level of emotional conveyance. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, but there might be a very slight sense of importance or seriousness, so I will adjust the surprise score to 2 to reflect this slight adjustment.",
