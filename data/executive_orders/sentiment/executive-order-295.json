    "critique": "The executive order discusses hostile Indians, arms, and ammunition, suggesting fear and disgust. The resolution aims to prevent ammunition from reaching hostile Indians, implying a need for action and control. The language used is formal and legalistic, which might evoke a sense of seriousness and concern. The initial scores reflect these emotions, with fear and disgust being the most prominent. After further consideration, the element of surprise is not really present. The revised scores adjust the intensity of the emotions based on a more nuanced understanding of the text.",
