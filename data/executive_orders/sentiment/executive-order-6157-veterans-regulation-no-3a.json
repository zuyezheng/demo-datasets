It clarifies the process for disability ratings and ensures that existing benefits are not drastically reduced. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with a secondary emotion of surprise that the government is taking action to help veterans. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
