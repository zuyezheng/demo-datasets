    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the exemption of Walter C. Sauer from mandatory retirement. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The president is conveying a sense of duty and adherence to legal procedures rather than any strong emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Since there is not enough information to portray any emotion, I will give a score of 1 for each.",
