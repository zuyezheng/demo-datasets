    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, progress, and national unity. While not explicitly joyful, the approval of the code suggests a positive step forward. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as such orders are part of the expected functioning of government. Therefore, I'll score joy as a low positive, and the rest as minimal.",
