    "critique": "The executive order seems to evoke sadness and perhaps a bit of disgust due to the revocation of land reserved for the Walapai Indians. There might also be a tinge of fear and surprise depending on the reader's perspective and knowledge of the situation. However, joy is unlikely to be conveyed. The initial scores reflect this assessment, but the revised scores slightly adjust the intensity of sadness and disgust based on further consideration.",
