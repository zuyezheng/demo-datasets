    "critique": "The document is a formal proclamation regarding the neutrality of the United States. It references treaties, laws, and previous proclamations. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the context of declaring neutrality in a war suggests a degree of concern or perhaps sadness about the ongoing conflict. The primary goal seems to be to convey a sense of seriousness and commitment to neutrality. Therefore, I will assign low scores to most emotions, with a slightly higher score for sadness due to the context of war.",
