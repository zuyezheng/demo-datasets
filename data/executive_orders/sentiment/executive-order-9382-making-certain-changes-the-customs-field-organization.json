    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action, adjusting customs field organization. It revokes the designation of Westby, Montana, as a customs port of entry and extends the limits of Nogales and Douglas, Arizona. The language is formal and factual, with no apparent intention to evoke strong emotions. The order seems intended to be perceived as a practical adjustment to customs operations. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low.",
