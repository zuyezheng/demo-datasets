    "critique": "The executive order seems to want the audience to feel joy and surprise. The order is about appointing someone to a position without following the usual rules, which might bring joy to the person being appointed and surprise to others. However, the overall tone is neutral and formal. The initial scores for joy and surprise are set to 3 and 2, respectively. After further consideration, the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores are set to 1 for both joy and surprise.",
