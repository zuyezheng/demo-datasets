    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of resolution and finality regarding the transfer of powers back to the Federal Trade Commission. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legalistic and procedural, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, the initial assessment holds. The document's purpose is administrative, not emotional, so the scores remain minimal.",
