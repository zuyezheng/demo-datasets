The primary emotion it might evoke is a sense of resolution or closure regarding the powers of the Fuel Administration. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild element if someone was unaware of the Fuel Administration's status.",
