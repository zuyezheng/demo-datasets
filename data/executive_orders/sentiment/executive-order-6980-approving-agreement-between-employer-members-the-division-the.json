    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document with the primary goal of communicating a decision regarding an agreement within the Construction Industry. It doesn't seem to explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a subtle sense of joy for those in Manhattan and the Bronx whose agreement was approved, and perhaps a touch of sadness or disappointment for those in Richmond whose agreement was not. Surprise, fear, disgust and anger don't seem to be relevant emotions in this context.",
