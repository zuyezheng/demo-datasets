There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The President is acting in an official capacity to resolve a potential disruption to interstate commerce. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on concern or seriousness, which might translate to a minimal level of fear or sadness due to the potential disruption.",
