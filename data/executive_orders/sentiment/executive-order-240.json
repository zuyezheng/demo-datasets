    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement of respect for General Sheridan upon his death. The primary emotion conveyed should be sadness, with a touch of respect and solemnity. There might be a slight surprise at the suddenness of the announcement, but overall, sadness should be the dominant emotion. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the sadness and decrease the surprise to better reflect the order's intent.",
