    "critique": "The executive order discusses terrorist acts, assassinations, and obstruction of justice. The order aims to prevent further such acts by blocking assets of those involved. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are anger and disgust towards the perpetrators, and perhaps a sense of surprise or shock at the severity of the situation. There might also be an element of fear conveyed, regarding the potential for future attacks. However, the overall tone is formal and decisive, aiming to project strength and resolve rather than overt emotionality. Therefore, the scores should reflect a moderate level of anger and disgust, and lower levels of fear and surprise. Joy and sadness are not relevant in this context.",
