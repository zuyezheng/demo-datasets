There is a sense of hope that this code will help with unemployment and disorganization, but it is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the emotions conveyed are minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for all emotions. The revised scores are similar, with slight adjustments to reflect the potential for positive change.",
