    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President of the United States regarding the closure of government offices as a mark of respect for Dwight David Eisenhower. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death of a former president. There might be a hint of surprise due to the unexpected nature of death, but it's minimal. There's no explicit expression of joy, anger, fear, or disgust. The intensity of sadness is moderate, given the respect being shown.",
