    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and reassurance. The mention of 'minimizing the financial exposure of the American taxpayers' might evoke a sense of relief or mild joy. The establishment of a commission to examine and improve the Postal Service could inspire a little hope or surprise that action is being taken. However, the overall tone is formal and bureaucratic, so strong emotions are unlikely. The initial scores reflect these considerations, but the revised scores slightly increase the 'joy' and 'surprise' to acknowledge the potential positive feelings associated with the order's goals.",
