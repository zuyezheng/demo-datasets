    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to examine the United States Postal Service. The language is formal and legalistic, with the primary goal of conveying authority and outlining the commission's responsibilities. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document focuses on establishing a commission, defining its mission, and setting deadlines. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional content.",
