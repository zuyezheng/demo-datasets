    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to examine the United States Postal Service. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but there is a slight sense of concern and determination to improve the postal service. Therefore, I will assign low scores to sadness, fear, and disgust, and slightly higher scores to joy and surprise, reflecting the positive goal of improving the postal service and the novelty of establishing a commission.",
