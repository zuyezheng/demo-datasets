    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of pride and accomplishment related to the Panama Canal opening. There might be a touch of surprise at the scale and importance of the event, but overall, the dominant emotion is joy or satisfaction. The order is very formal and procedural, so strong emotions are unlikely. The initial scores reflect a moderate level of joy and a slight surprise. The revised scores slightly increase the joy and decrease the surprise, as the primary goal is to convey the importance and success of the project.",
