    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order. It concerns the responsibilities of the United States High Commissioner for Germany regarding war criminals. The language is legal and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the subject matter (war criminals) might implicitly evoke some negative emotions. Given the formal nature, the intensity of any conveyed emotion is likely to be low. Therefore, I will assign low scores to sadness, fear, and disgust, and a score of 1 to joy and surprise as these emotions are not relevant to the document.",
