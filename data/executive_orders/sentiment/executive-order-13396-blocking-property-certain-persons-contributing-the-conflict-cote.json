    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration of a national emergency with respect to the situation in Cote d'Ivoire. The President is conveying a sense of seriousness and determination to address the threat to national security and foreign policy. The language is legalistic and devoid of overt emotional expression. However, the underlying context involves violence, human rights abuses, and political instability, which could evoke feelings of sadness, fear, and disgust in the American public. Given the formal nature of the document, the primary emotion conveyed is concern and determination, with secondary emotions of sadness, fear, and disgust arising from the context. The scores reflect the expected intensity of these emotions in the American public upon reading this document.The initial scores are based on the assumption that the public will primarily perceive the seriousness of the situation and the President's determination to act. The revised scores take into account the potential for sadness, fear, and disgust arising from the details of the situation in Cote d'Ivoire, while still emphasizing the primary emotions of concern and determination.",
