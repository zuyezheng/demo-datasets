    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a working group to address unlawful conduct on the internet. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of urgency and concern about the issues being addressed, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 3, Surprise: 2. After further consideration, I think the initial scores are appropriate.",
