    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding a labor dispute. It expresses concern about the potential impact of a strike on national safety. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the concern about national safety implies a degree of fear and perhaps sadness about the potential consequences. The formal tone and the nature of the document suggest that these emotions are present but not strongly emphasized. Therefore, the initial scores are set to 1 for joy, disgust, and surprise, and 3 for sadness and fear.",
