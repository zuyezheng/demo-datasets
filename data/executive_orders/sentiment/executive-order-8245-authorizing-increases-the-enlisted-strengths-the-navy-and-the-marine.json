    "critique": "The document is a formal proclamation regarding increasing the enlisted strength of the Navy and Marine Corps due to a national emergency. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of urgency and preparedness, but it is delivered in a formal, official tone. Therefore, the scores should reflect a low level of emotional intensity across the board, with perhaps a slightly higher score for fear and surprise due to the mention of a national emergency.",
