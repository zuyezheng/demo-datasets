    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining policies and responsibilities related to national security and emergency preparedness communications. The primary goal is to ensure effective communication during critical times. Therefore, the intended emotions are more aligned with reassurance, confidence, and a sense of security rather than strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to instill confidence in the government's ability to handle emergencies and maintain communication. Therefore, I will adjust the scores to reflect this.",
