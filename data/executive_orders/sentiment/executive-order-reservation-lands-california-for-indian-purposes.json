    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a declaration of land being withdrawn and set aside for Indian purposes. The order itself doesn't seem to convey any particular emotion. However, one could argue that it could bring joy to those who support the protection of indigenous lands, and perhaps sadness, anger, or fear to those who may be negatively affected by the order. Surprise is unlikely, as executive orders are a normal part of governance. Disgust is also unlikely. I will score it based on a slight conveyance of joy.",
