    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the termination of wage and salary controls. The primary emotion conveyed is one of resolution and transition. There is a slight sense of relief (joy) that the war-time controls are ending, but it's very subdued. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this formal and neutral tone.",
