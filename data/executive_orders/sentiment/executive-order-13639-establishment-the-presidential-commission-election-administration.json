    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing a commission on election administration. It is primarily a formal and procedural document. The language is neutral and objective, focusing on the structure, mission, and administration of the commission. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon further reflection, the president may be trying to convey a sense of joy that the elections will be administered efficiently, and surprise that there are still issues with elections. The other emotions are not relevant.",
