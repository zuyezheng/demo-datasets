    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order creating a board to investigate disputes between railway carriers and their employees. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. A low score is appropriate for all emotions. The document expresses a sense of urgency and importance, but not necessarily any strong emotion. Therefore, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions.",
