    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding budget requests for executive departments and agencies. The language is formal and legalistic. The purpose of the order is to reduce administrative costs. There is no explicit emotional language. However, a sense of determination and perhaps slight optimism (that the order will improve administrative productivity) might be inferred. The order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. Therefore, the initial scores are set low, with a slight increase in joy to represent the optimism.",
