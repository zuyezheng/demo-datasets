    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a sense of determination to control the Federal deficit and improve administrative productivity. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there is an underlying sense of seriousness and resolve. The order aims to address a problem (Federal deficit) and implement solutions. Therefore, the emotion scores should reflect this underlying tone, with low scores for emotions not directly related to the document's purpose and higher scores for emotions that align with the seriousness of the situation.",
