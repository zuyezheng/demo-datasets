    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal document regarding tax returns and their inspection by the Military Renegotiation Policy and Review Board. The language is formal and technical, and the purpose seems to be administrative. Therefore, it is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to inform and authorize a specific action related to government operations.",
