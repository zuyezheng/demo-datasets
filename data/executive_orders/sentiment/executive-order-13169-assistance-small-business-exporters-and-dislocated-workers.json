    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a sense of optimism and opportunity regarding trade and assistance to small businesses and dislocated workers. There is a mild sense of hope and determination, but overall, the tone is neutral and official. The initial scores reflect this, with slight emphasis on joy and surprise due to the new opportunities. The revised scores slightly adjust the emphasis based on a more careful reading, reducing surprise and increasing joy slightly.",
