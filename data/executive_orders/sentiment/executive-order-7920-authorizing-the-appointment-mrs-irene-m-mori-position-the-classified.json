    "critique": "The executive order discusses the appointment of Mrs. Irene M. Mori, the widow of a War Department employee, to a position in the classified service. The order aims to evoke sympathy and perhaps a sense of justice. The initial scores reflect these emotions, with sadness being the most prominent. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity of these emotions based on a more nuanced understanding of the order's purpose.",
