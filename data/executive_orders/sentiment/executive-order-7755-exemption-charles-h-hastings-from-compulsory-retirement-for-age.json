    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the retirement of a government employee. It primarily conveys a sense of official procedure and necessity. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of necessity or importance, but it's very subdued. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on the lack of negative emotions.",
