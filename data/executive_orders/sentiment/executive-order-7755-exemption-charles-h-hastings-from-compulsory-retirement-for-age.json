    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and reassurance. It uses formal language and refers to legal provisions, suggesting a desire to convey a sense of order and control rather than strong emotions. While there might be a hint of relief that Charles H. Hastings is allowed to continue his service, the overall tone is quite neutral. Therefore, I will score joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all as 1 initially. After further consideration, I think the order conveys a very slight sense of reassurance and stability, so I will increase joy to 2.",
