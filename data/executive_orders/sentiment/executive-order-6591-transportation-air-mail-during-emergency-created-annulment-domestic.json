It conveys a serious tone, but does not explicitly express joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The president is taking decisive action to ensure the continuation of air mail service. Therefore, the initial scores would be low across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for concern or determination.",
