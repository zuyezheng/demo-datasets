    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that withdraws land from settlement. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is factual and procedural, so it should not convey joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low for all emotions. After further consideration, the scores should remain low, as the document's purpose is administrative rather than emotional.",
