There might be a slight sense of joy for those who benefit from the order. There isn't a strong emphasis on any particular emotion, but rather on the practical implementation of land allocation. The order does not want the audience to feel disgust, fear, sadness, or surprise. The order wants the audience to feel joy because it is giving land to ex-service men.",
