    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a very formal and dry document. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The order is about delaying certain transfers, consolidations, and eliminations. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, I still believe the scores should be low, but I will adjust them slightly to reflect a minimal level of surprise that might be conveyed by the order.",
