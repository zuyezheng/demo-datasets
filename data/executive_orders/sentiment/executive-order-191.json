    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order to close Executive Departments and the Government Printing Office for Memorial Day. The primary emotion conveyed is respect and solemn remembrance of soldiers and sailors who died in the Civil War. There is a sense of sadness for the loss of life, but it is presented in a formal and respectful manner. There is no explicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise expressed in the document. The sadness score is moderate to reflect the solemn nature of the occasion. The other emotions are scored low to reflect their absence.",
