    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement about closing government offices for Memorial Day. The primary emotion it aims to evoke is a sense of respect and solemn remembrance for the soldiers and sailors who died in the Civil War. While not explicitly stated, there's an underlying sense of sadness and perhaps a touch of solemn joy in honoring their memory. There might be a slight surprise for people who didn't know about the holiday.",
