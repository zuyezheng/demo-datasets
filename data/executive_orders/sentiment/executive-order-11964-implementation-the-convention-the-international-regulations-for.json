    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining regulations for preventing collisions at sea. It aims to inform and instruct, not to evoke strong emotions. However, a sense of security and order might be subtly conveyed. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. After further consideration, I believe the initial scores accurately represent the emotional impact of the document.",
