    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about appointing Miss Will Harris to the classified service without compliance with the Civil Service rules, based on the recommendation of the Secretary of State. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being intentionally conveyed. The order is simply a formal announcement of a decision.",
