    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding a civil service appointment. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The language is bureaucratic and factual, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal emotional response. Upon review, this seems appropriate given the document's nature.",
