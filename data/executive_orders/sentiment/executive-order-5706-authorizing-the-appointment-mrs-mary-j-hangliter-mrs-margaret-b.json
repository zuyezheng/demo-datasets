    "critique": "The document describes the appointment of several women to positions in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The justification for these appointments is based on the fact that these women are widows or daughters of former employees who died or became disabled, leaving them with little or no income. The document evokes sadness and perhaps a sense of justice or compassion. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is moderate, as the document presents these situations in a factual manner without overly emotional language. The intensity of joy, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are low, as these emotions are not directly conveyed by the document.",
