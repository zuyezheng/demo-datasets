    "critique": "The document is a formal proclamation regarding the increase of military personnel in response to a national emergency. The language is formal and legalistic, lacking strong emotional cues. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is a sense of concern or seriousness due to the emergency, but it's presented in a factual, non-emotional way. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on fear and sadness due to the context of a national emergency.",
