    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey joy and surprise. The order discusses the appointment of Mr. Oden to the position of Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy. The order also mentions that Mr. Oden failed to complete his probationary period in the competitive classified civil service in 1913 by a few days. This could be seen as a surprise.
