It should evoke a sense of fear regarding the potential dangers posed by Iran and a sense of disgust towards the actions that necessitate such measures. Surprise is not a primary emotion intended to be conveyed, as the order builds upon existing policies. Joy and sadness are not relevant in this context.",
