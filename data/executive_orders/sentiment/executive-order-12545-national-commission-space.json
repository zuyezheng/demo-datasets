    "critique": "The executive order is a very dry, technical document. The order extends the time within which the National Commission on Space may submit its plan and recommendations. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions after reading the executive order. The most likely emotion is surprise, as the audience may be surprised by the extension. However, the intensity of this emotion is likely to be very low.",
