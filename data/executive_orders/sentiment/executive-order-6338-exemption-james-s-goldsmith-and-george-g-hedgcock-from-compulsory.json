    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and reassurance. It uses formal language and refers to specific legal provisions, suggesting a desire to convey competence and order. There's no strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal appears to be administrative rather than emotional. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further consideration, the order might evoke a slight sense of surprise due to the specific exemptions granted. However, this surprise is minimal and doesn't significantly alter the overall emotional tone.",
