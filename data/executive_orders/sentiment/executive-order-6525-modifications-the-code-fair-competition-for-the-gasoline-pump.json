    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order and progress, potentially evoking a mild sense of joy and surprise that the government is working efficiently. However, the primary goal is to inform, not to elicit strong emotions. The language is formal and bureaucratic, which would likely suppress any strong emotional response. Therefore, the initial scores are likely too high and should be adjusted downwards to reflect the document's neutral tone.",
