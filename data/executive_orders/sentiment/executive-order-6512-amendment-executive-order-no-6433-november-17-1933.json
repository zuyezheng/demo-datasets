    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and reassurance by preventing disruption. It does not seem to want to evoke strong emotions. The order seeks to convey a sense of stability and order. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon further reflection, the order could evoke a slight sense of relief (joy) and reduced anxiety (less fear) for those affected by the decision. The revised scores will reflect this nuance.",
