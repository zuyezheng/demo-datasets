    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding drug abuse policy. It primarily focuses on assigning responsibilities and clarifying roles within the Executive Office. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of determination or seriousness, but it's not explicitly conveyed. Considering the formal nature, a baseline of 1 is appropriate for emotions not explicitly present.",
