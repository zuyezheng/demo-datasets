    "critique": "The document expresses concern and determination to combat transnational criminal organizations. It highlights the dangers they pose, including violence, drug trafficking, and human smuggling, which evoke fear and disgust. The President aims to convey a sense of urgency and resolve to address these issues, suggesting a desire to instill confidence and security in the American people. The language used is strong and decisive, reflecting a commitment to action. Therefore, fear, disgust, and a degree of determination/joy (in the sense of resolving the issue) are the primary emotions conveyed. There's little to suggest surprise or sadness.",
