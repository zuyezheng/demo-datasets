    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal for potential addition to Zion National Park. It uses legal and administrative language, and aims to convey a sense of official action rather than personal emotion. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After reflection, I still believe that the document does not evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores remain the same.",
