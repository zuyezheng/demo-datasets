    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of responsibility and control over the budget. It doesn't explicitly evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle sense of reassurance or confidence conveyed through the order's focus on efficiency and fiscal management. I will assign low scores to joy and surprise to reflect this.",
