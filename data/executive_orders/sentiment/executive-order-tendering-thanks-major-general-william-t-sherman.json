There might be a hint of surprise at the unexpected victory, but overall, the dominant emotion is joy.The initial scores reflect these observations, with joy being the highest, followed by surprise. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context, so they are scored as 1.The revised scores maintain the emphasis on joy but slightly reduce the surprise score to reflect the primary focus on gratitude and admiration.",
