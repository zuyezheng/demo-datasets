    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to a railway mail rule. It's an official communication, so it's unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotions, if any, would be related to the impact of the rule change, but without more context, it's difficult to assess. I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for 'surprise' as rule changes can sometimes be unexpected. After revision, I will reduce the surprise score to 1 as well, since there is no indication of surprise.",
