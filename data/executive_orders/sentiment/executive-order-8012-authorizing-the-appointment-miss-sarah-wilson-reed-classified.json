    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the appointment of Miss Saiah Wilson Reed to a classified position in the Navy Department. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue there is a hint of joy or satisfaction in granting this appointment, and perhaps a touch of sadness related to the disability of Miss Reed's father. Surprise, fear, disgust, and anger are not conveyed in any way. Therefore, the initial scores will be very low, with a slight bump for joy and sadness.",
