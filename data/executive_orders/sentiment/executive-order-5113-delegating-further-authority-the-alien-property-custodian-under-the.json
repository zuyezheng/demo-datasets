    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of power related to the Trading with the Enemy Act. It is a legal and administrative document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary purpose is to delegate authority and ensure the smooth functioning of the Alien Property Custodian's office. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low, reflecting the document's neutral and formal tone. Considering the lack of emotional language, a score of 1 is appropriate for most emotions. There might be a slight sense of surprise due to the order being issued, but it's minimal.",
