    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for Indian reservations. It uses formal and legal language. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the act of setting aside land for a reservation could be interpreted as a gesture of goodwill (joy) or an attempt to rectify past injustices (sadness). Given the formal nature, these emotions are likely very muted. Fear, disgust, and surprise are not relevant in this context. I will assign low scores to joy and sadness and a score of 1 to the rest.",
