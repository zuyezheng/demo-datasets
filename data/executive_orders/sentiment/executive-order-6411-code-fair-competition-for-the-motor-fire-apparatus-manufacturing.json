    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of formal approval and implementation of regulations. It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle sense of reassurance or confidence that the audience is intended to feel. The order is very bureaucratic and procedural, so it is unlikely to elicit strong emotions. The initial scores will be very low, with a slight bump for joy, as the order is meant to inspire confidence.",
