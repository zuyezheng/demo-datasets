It addresses a dispute and establishes a board to investigate, suggesting a desire to resolve the issue peacefully and efficiently. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be a mild sense of reassurance or perhaps a slight sense of hope that the situation will be resolved. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is more about procedure and problem-solving.",
