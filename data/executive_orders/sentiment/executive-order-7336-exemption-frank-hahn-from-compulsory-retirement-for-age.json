While it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions, there might be a subtle sense of joy that a qualified individual is allowed to continue their service for the public good, and perhaps a hint of surprise that such exemptions exist. The order does not seem to want to convey sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
