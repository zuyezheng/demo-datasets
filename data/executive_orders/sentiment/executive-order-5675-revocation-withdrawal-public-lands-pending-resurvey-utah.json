    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land use. It revokes a previous order and opens the land for homesteading by ex-service men and then the general public. There is no explicit emotional language. The expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal, as it's a bureaucratic action. However, some people might feel joy if they are ex-service men who can now claim land, or perhaps some surprise that land is being opened up. Others might feel sadness or disgust if they were hoping to use the land for other purposes, but these emotions are less likely to be strong. Fear and anger are unlikely to be relevant emotions in this context. Given the lack of strong emotional cues, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slight bump for joy and surprise.",
