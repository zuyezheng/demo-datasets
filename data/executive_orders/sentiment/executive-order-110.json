    "critique": "The document expresses a formal order to permanently mark the graves of soldiers. It conveys a sense of duty and respect for the soldiers who died at Santiago. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there is an implicit sense of sadness related to the loss of life, but it is very subdued. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions, with a slightly higher score for sadness.",
