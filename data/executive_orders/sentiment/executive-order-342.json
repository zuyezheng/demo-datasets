    "critique": "The document is a formal set of rules and regulations for the executive civil service. It is primarily concerned with establishing procedures for examinations, appointments, and promotions. The language is formal and legalistic, with no overt expression of emotions. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of joy in establishing a fair system, and perhaps a touch of sadness that such rules are necessary, but these are very subtle.",
