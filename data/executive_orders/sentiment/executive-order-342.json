    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of fairness, order, and trust in the government. It establishes rules for civil service, emphasizing impartiality and competence. Therefore, the primary emotions it should evoke are joy (related to fairness and opportunity) and surprise (related to the changes and reforms). There might be a slight element of fear for those who previously benefited from a less regulated system, and disgust at the idea of the corruption that the order is trying to prevent, but these are secondary. I will revise the scores to reflect this.",
