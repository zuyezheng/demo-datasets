    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining trade agreements and procedures. It aims to reassure various stakeholders (American industry, labor, farmers) that their interests will be safeguarded. The primary emotion it seeks to convey is a sense of stability and confidence in the trade process. There might be a slight element of surprise at the level of detail and the measures taken to protect domestic interests, but it's not a dominant emotion. There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
