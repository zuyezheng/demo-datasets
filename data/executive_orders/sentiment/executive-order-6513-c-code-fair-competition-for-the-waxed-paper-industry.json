    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of formal approval and implementation of regulations. It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle intention to inspire a sense of confidence and stability through the formal approval of the code. Considering this, I'll assign low scores for joy and surprise, and zero for the rest. After revision, I will keep the scores the same, as the document is very formal.",
