It primarily conveys a sense of duty and official action, with a slight undercurrent of positive intent towards veterans. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this neutrality, with a slight emphasis on joy due to the positive impact on veterans' employment.",
