    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order. It primarily deals with administrative and financial matters related to Public Health Service hospitals and Saint Elizabeths Hospital. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legal and bureaucratic, focusing on the transfer of funds and the authority to do so. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions.I will give a score of 1 for all the emotions.",
