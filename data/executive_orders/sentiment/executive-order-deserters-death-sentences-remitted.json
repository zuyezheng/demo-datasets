    "critique": "The executive order discusses the punishment of deserters during war time. The primary emotions conveyed are intended to instill fear and perhaps a sense of justice (or lack thereof, potentially disgust) in those who might consider desertion. There's a slight element of surprise that the president is choosing to mitigate death sentences to imprisonment. There is no joy or sadness intended to be conveyed.The initial scores reflect these considerations. After further consideration, the element of surprise is minimal, and the intensity of fear should be slightly higher to reflect the gravity of the situation.",
