    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of determination and optimism regarding the United States' leadership in artificial intelligence. There's an element of joy in securing a brighter future, but also a sense of urgency and perhaps a hint of fear of falling behind if action isn't taken. Disgust and surprise are not prominent emotions in this context. The language is formal and assertive, aiming to inspire confidence and action.",
