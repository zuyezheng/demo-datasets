    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the withholding of income and employment taxes. It is primarily an administrative document. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low for all emotions. After further consideration, the scores should remain low as the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke strong emotions.",
