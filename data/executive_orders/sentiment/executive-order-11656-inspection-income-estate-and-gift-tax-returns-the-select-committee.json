    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal and legal document. The order itself doesn't seem to directly evoke any strong emotions. The order is related to tax returns and inspection by a committee, which might indirectly cause some level of concern or surprise in some individuals, but the primary purpose isn't to evoke emotions. The order is related to crime, so it may evoke some fear or disgust. The order seems to be more informative and procedural in nature, so I will keep the scores low.",
