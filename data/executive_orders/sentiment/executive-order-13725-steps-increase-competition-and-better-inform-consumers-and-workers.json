    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of determination and resolve to address anti-competitive practices and promote a fair marketplace. While not explicitly expressing emotions, the language suggests a strong commitment to protecting consumers and workers. Therefore, I will score it for Joy, as it aims to create a better economic environment, and Surprise, as it introduces new measures. The other emotions are less relevant.",
