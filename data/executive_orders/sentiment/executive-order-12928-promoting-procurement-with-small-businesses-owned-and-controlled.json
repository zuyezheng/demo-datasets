    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to promote participation in Federal procurement by Small Businesses Owned and Controlled by Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of determination and resolve to enforce existing laws and policies. There is a very slight hint of joy in promoting equality, and a very slight hint of sadness that some departments have failed to aggressively pursue such goals. There is no strong expression of any emotion.",
