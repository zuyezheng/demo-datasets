    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies. It outlines the council's composition, functions, and responsibilities, as well as those of the Secretary of the Treasury. The language is legal and procedural, with no overt emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most people would likely not have a strong reaction to this type of document. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the document does not convey any strong emotions. The revised scores remain the same.",
