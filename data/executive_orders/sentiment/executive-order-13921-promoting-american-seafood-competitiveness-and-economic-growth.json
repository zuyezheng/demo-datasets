The primary emotion conveyed is joy, stemming from the potential for job creation, economic improvement, and access to safe food. There's a secondary element of hope and optimism, but the document avoids strong negative emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not a relevant emotion in this context.",
