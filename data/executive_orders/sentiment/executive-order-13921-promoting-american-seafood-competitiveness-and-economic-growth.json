    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of purpose and determination to improve the American economy and the seafood industry. There is a hint of concern regarding the current state of the industry and illegal fishing practices, but this is presented in a factual, non-emotional way. Therefore, I will assign low scores to negative emotions and a moderate score to joy, reflecting the positive goals outlined in the order.",
