    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of an agreement related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic. There is no strong emotional content. A baseline of 1 is appropriate for most emotions, as the document aims for neutrality. There might be a slight sense of joy that the agreement is approved, but it's very subdued.",
