    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability, confidence, and perhaps slight relief that issues are being resolved. There's no strong push for intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order focuses on correcting errors and ensuring fair competition, suggesting a desire for order and resolution. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board.",
