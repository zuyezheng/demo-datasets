    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Motor Vehicle Maintenance Trade. The language is legal and administrative, with no strong emotional cues. The president is conveying a sense of authority and decisiveness, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed might be a mild sense of hope or optimism that the code will improve the industry, but this is very subtle. Therefore, the initial scores are set to low values, with a slightly higher score for joy to reflect the potential for positive outcomes.",
