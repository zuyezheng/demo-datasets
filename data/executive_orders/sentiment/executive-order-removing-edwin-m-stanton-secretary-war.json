    "critique": "The document is a formal letter of dismissal. It is addressed to Edwin M. Stanton and informs him of his removal from office as Secretary for the Department of War. The language is formal and direct, without any explicit emotional expression. However, the act of firing someone can be associated with negative emotions such as sadness, fear, or anger, but these are not explicitly conveyed in the text. The tone is respectful but firm. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions, with a slightly higher score for sadness due to the nature of the communication.",
