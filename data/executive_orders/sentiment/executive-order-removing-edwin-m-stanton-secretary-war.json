    "critique": "The document is a formal letter from the President removing Edwin M. Stanton from his position as Secretary of War. The language is formal and direct, without any explicit emotional expression. However, the act of removing someone from office could be interpreted as conveying some level of anger or disgust, but it's more likely a calculated decision based on policy or political reasons. The public might feel surprise at the removal, but the intensity would likely be low unless there's a significant backstory or context not provided in the document. Given the lack of emotional language, the scores should be relatively low across all emotions. Initial scores: disgust: 2, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 2, surprise: 3. Revised scores: disgust: 2, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 2, surprise: 3",
