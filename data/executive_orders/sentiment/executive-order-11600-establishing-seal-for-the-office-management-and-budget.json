    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of formality, respect for tradition, and confidence in the office it establishes a seal for. It does not seem to want to evoke strong emotions but rather a sense of stability and importance. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not relevant. Surprise might be a very mild element, as the reader learns about the new seal, but it's not a primary goal of the text.",
