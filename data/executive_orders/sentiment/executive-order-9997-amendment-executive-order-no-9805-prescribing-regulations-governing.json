    "critique": "The executive order is a dry, factual document about travel expenses. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotions are likely to be surprise, because people might be surprised to see such a mundane topic being addressed by an executive order, and perhaps a tiny bit of joy if the change in travel expenses is beneficial to some people. However, the intensity of these emotions would be very low.",
