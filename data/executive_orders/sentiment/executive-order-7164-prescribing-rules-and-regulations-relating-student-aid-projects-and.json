The order provides opportunities for students to continue their education and for youth to find employment. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy. There might be a slight sense of surprise at the scope and scale of the aid being offered, but it's not the main focus. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
