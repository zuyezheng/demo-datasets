    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the abolishment of the Office of the Alien Property Custodian and the transfer of its functions to the Department of Justice. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The primary goal is to communicate the reorganization in a clear and authoritative manner. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal. Most emotions would be close to 1, except perhaps surprise, as major governmental reorganizations can sometimes elicit surprise.",
