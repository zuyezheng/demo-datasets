    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It modifies a previous order and clarifies appointment procedures within the Department of Labor. There is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. The order is formal and procedural in nature, lacking any language that would evoke strong feelings. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
