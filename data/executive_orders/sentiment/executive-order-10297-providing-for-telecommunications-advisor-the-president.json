    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of security and order. It establishes a position to coordinate telecommunications, which could evoke a feeling of reassurance and perhaps mild surprise that such a role is being formally created. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, disgust, or fear. The primary emotions are a low level of surprise and a slightly higher level of reassurance or lack of fear. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the surprise to acknowledge the novelty of the position.",
