There might be a touch of surprise that such measures are being taken, but overall, the goal is to instill a sense of stability and control. The initial scores reflect this, with joy and surprise being the primary emotions, followed by a lesser degree of fear and sadness. The revised scores adjust the intensity of these emotions based on a more nuanced understanding of the text.",
