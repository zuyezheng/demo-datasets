    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the line of succession for the Secretary of Commerce. It outlines who is authorized to perform the duties of the Secretary in their absence. Given the formal and procedural nature of the document, the primary emotions conveyed are neutral. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for each emotion should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional content. I will set each to 1 as there is no information to suggest otherwise. After further consideration, the formal tone and legalistic language further reinforce the absence of any strong emotional expression. The revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
