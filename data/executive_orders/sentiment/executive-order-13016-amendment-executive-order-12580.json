The language is formal and technical. The order aims to improve interagency coordination and efficiency in dealing with environmental releases. The intended emotional response is likely to be a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to handle environmental issues effectively. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a very mild sense of reassurance might be intended.Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 0, Anger: 0, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Surprise: 0.Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 0, Anger: 0, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Surprise: 0.",
