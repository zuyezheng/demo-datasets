    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order. It invokes presidential authority and cites legal statutes. The language is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. Upon review, the formal nature and legal context suggest a slightly elevated sense of authority, which could be interpreted as a very mild form of confidence or resolve, nudging joy up slightly. All other emotions remain minimal due to the document's objective and unemotional tone.",
