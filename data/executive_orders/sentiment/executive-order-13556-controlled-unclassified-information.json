    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish a uniform program for managing controlled unclassified information. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of purpose and authority, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. The primary goal is to establish a clear and consistent process. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of purpose or determination, but it's not strong enough to warrant a high score for any particular emotion.",
