It seeks to minimize fear and anxiety related to inflation and economic disruption. While not explicitly joyful, it aims to create a sense of hope and stability. There's a subtle element of surprise in the comprehensive measures being taken. Disgust and sadness are not primary emotions the order intends to evoke.",
