    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Interagency Security Committee. It focuses on enhancing security in Federal facilities. The language is formal and bureaucratic, with no explicit emotional tone. However, the implicit emotions conveyed might be a sense of reassurance (due to enhanced security) and perhaps a mild sense of surprise (due to the establishment of a new committee). There's no indication of anger, disgust, fear or sadness.",
