    "critique": "The executive order is a factual statement about the maximum number of women who can serve in the Women's Army Corps. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is formal and bureaucratic in tone, so it is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, it could evoke a very mild sense of surprise that the order was necessary, or perhaps a mild sense of joy that the Women's Army Corps was being established. The initial scores are set to reflect these mild emotions.",
