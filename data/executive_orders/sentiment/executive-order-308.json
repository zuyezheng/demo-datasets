    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about the closure of government offices for the dedication of the Washington Monument. It's a factual statement with no explicit emotional content. However, the dedication of a national monument could evoke a sense of pride and perhaps joy, but it's very subtle. The other emotions are not relevant.\n\nInitial assessment:\nJoy: 3 (slight sense of national pride/celebration)\nSadness: 1\nAnger: 1\nFear: 1\nDisgust: 1\nSurprise: 1\n\nRevised assessment:\nGiven the formal tone and the lack of explicit emotional cues, I'll reduce the joy score slightly.\nJoy: 2\nSadness: 1\nAnger: 1\nFear: 1\nDisgust: 1\nSurprise: 1",
