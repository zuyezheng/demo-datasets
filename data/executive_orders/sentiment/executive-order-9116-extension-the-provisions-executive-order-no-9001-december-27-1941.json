    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of urgency and resolve, but not necessarily to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to communicate the extension of certain provisions to facilitate the war effort. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The order is extending provisions, so surprise should be minimal. There might be a slight sense of reassurance (joy) that the war effort is being expedited, but it's not a dominant emotion. There's no explicit sadness, fear, or disgust intended.",
