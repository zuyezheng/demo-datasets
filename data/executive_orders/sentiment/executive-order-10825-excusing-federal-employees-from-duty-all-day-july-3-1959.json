    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to provide clarity and instructions regarding a holiday observance. The primary emotion it seeks to evoke is a sense of order and perhaps a mild sense of joy or gratitude for the holiday. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions like fear, disgust, or intense sadness. Surprise is also not a likely emotion, as the order is about a predictable event. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy being the only emotion with a non-zero score. The revised scores slightly adjust the joy score to better reflect the document's tone.",
