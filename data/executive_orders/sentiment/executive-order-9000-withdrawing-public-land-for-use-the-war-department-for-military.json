    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President withdrawing land for military purposes. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, given the context of 1941, a time of war, a sense of urgency and perhaps underlying fear might be present, but it is very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for fear and surprise due to the emergency situation.",
