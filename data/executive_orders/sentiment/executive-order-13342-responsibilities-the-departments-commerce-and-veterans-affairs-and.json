    "critique": "The document is an executive order. It is a formal and legal document. The president is trying to convey a sense of leadership and decisiveness. The document itself does not convey any particular emotion. However, the order is intended to help people and communities, so there is a slight sense of joy. The order is also intended to address social and community needs, so there is a slight sense of sadness that these needs exist. The order is not intended to convey anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores are based on the assumption that the American public will feel a slight sense of joy and sadness, but not any other emotion.",
