    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the import of red cedar shingles from Canada. It cites legal statutes and provides specific quantities. The language is very formal and factual. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on sadness because it is a formal document.",
