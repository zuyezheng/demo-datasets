    "critique": "The executive order mainly describes the approval of an official seal for the Small Defense Plants Administration. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise or interest due to the description of the seal. Other emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context. The initial scores are set accordingly, with a low surprise score and zero for other emotions. After further consideration, the element of surprise is negligible. The order is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any strong emotions in the reader. Therefore, all scores should be set to zero.",
