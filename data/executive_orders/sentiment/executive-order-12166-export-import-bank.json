    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining the delegation of authority regarding the Export-Import Bank. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue it aims to inspire a sense of trust (joy) in the government's ability to manage international policy effectively and perhaps a mild sense of reassurance (surprise) that environmental protection and human rights are being considered. There's no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust.",
