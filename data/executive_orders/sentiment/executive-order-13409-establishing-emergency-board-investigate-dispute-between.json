    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to establish an emergency board to investigate a dispute. The language is neutral and factual, focusing on legal requirements and procedures. The order does not seem to evoke strong emotions. A slight sense of relief or reassurance might be present, but it's very mild. Therefore, I will score joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all as 1.",
