    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order issued by President Roosevelt. It primarily concerns financial regulations related to gold. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, given the context of the Great Depression, the order implicitly conveys a sense of urgency and determination to address the economic crisis. Therefore, I will assign low scores for sadness, fear, and surprise, and a slightly higher score for determination (joy). Disgust is not relevant in this context.",
