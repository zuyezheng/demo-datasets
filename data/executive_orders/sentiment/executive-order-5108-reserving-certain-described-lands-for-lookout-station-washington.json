    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration about land withdrawal for a specific purpose. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal appears to be to inform and instruct, not to elicit feelings of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. After further consideration, it is clear that the order is purely administrative and intended to be neutral in tone. Therefore, the revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
