    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The language is legalistic and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the context suggests a sense of concern and urgency due to the potential disruption of interstate commerce. The President aims to convey a sense of responsibility and decisiveness in resolving the issue. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed are concern and a desire to project control and stability. I will assign initial scores based on these considerations, with sadness reflecting concern, and low scores for other emotions as they are not explicitly present. Then I will revise the scores based on the critique.",
