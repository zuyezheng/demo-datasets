    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of seriousness and perhaps a bit of fear/disgust towards those who might violate the rules. It's about enforcing regulations, so there's not much room for joy or surprise. Sadness isn't really relevant either. The initial scores reflect this, but I think the fear and disgust could be slightly higher to emphasize the consequences of non-compliance.",
