    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It withdraws land from sale and settlement and adds it to the Navajo Indian Reservation. There is no explicit emotional appeal in the text. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. The initial scores are all 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon review, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, but I will adjust the surprise score to 2, as the order might cause a slight surprise to those directly affected by the land withdrawal.",
