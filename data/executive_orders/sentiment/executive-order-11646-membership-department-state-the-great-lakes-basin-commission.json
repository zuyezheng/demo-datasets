    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document with the purpose of coordinating efforts related to the Great Lakes Basin. It doesn't seem to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal appears to be administrative and organizational, with a focus on efficiency and collaboration. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The order aims to inspire a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's ability to manage resources effectively, so I will adjust the joy score slightly upward.",
