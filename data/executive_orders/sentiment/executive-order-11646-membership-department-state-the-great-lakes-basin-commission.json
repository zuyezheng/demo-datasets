    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the Great Lakes Basin Commission. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that the Department of State was not already included, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
