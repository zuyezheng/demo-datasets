    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of authority, delegating powers related to petroleum regulation to the Secretary of the Interior. It's a legal and administrative document, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The language is formal and procedural. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all categories. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. Upon review, this assessment remains accurate, as the document's purpose is purely administrative and not intended to elicit any particular emotional response from the public.",
