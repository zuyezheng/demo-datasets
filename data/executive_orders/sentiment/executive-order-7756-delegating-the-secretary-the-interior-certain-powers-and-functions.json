    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration related to the regulation of interstate and foreign commerce in petroleum and its products. The order itself doesn't seem to directly evoke strong emotions. However, it could be argued that there might be a subtle sense of reassurance (joy) that the government is taking action to regulate commerce. There might also be a very mild sense of surprise that such an order is being issued. I will score these emotions accordingly.",
