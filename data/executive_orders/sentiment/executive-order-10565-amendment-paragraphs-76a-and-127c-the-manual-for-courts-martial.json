    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending the Manual for Courts-Martial. It primarily deals with legal and military procedures, specifically regarding punishments and convictions. There is no explicit emotional language or expression present. The President is acting in an official capacity, and the document's purpose is to enact legal changes, not to convey personal feelings. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low, as the public is not expected to feel any strong emotion based on this document. I will set all initial scores to 1.",
