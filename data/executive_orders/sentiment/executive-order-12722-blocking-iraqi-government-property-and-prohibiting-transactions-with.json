    "critique": "The document conveys a sense of seriousness and determination to address a threat. There is a clear absence of joy. Sadness might be present due to the situation, but it's not explicitly emphasized. Anger is not directly expressed, but implied through the actions being taken. Fear is present due to the declared threat to national security. Disgust is not explicitly present. Surprise is minimal, as the declaration follows a logical course of action given the circumstances.",
