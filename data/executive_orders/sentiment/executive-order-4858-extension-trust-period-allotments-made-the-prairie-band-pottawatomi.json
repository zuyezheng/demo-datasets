    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending a trust period for land allotments. It's a legal document, so it's unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of relief or satisfaction for the Native American tribe, but it's very subdued. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy and surprise to reflect the positive outcome for the tribe.",
