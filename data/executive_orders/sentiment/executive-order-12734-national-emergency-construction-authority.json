The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of urgency and seriousness, with an underlying element of concern due to the threat to national security. There is no explicit expression of joy, but there is a sense of resolve. There is no surprise. The order invokes powers to deal with the threat, so there is an element of fear. There is no disgust or sadness.",
