It's likely intended to instill a sense of caution and perhaps a little fear regarding non-compliance, but mainly it should convey a sense of seriousness and resolve. There might be a hint of disgust towards those who might try to circumvent the rules, but it's not a primary emotion. There is no surprise or joy intended.",
