    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical amendment related to labor relations. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue it aims to inspire a sense of confidence (joy) in the government's ability to address labor issues and perhaps a mild surprise at the level of detail involved in such orders. There's no obvious intent to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
