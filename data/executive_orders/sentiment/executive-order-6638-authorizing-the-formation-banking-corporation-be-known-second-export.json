    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding the creation of a banking corporation. It references the economic crisis and the need for government intervention. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of determination and resolve to address the economic challenges. There's a hint of concern about the existing situation, but it's largely overshadowed by the proactive measures being taken. Therefore, I will assign low scores to negative emotions and a moderate score to joy, reflecting the hope for economic recovery.",
