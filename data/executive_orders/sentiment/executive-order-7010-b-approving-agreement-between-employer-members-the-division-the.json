    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of an agreement related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic. There is no strong emotional sentiment conveyed. The president is trying to portray a sense of order and progress, but not necessarily joy. There might be a hint of relief that the agreement is approved, but it's very subtle. The document is mostly informational, so most emotions should be scored low.",
