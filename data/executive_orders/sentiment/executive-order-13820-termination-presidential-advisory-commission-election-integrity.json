    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, focusing on the revocation of a previous order and clarifying the scope and limitations of the current order. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. However, depending on one's political views, the revocation of the previous order might elicit slight joy or relief in some, and perhaps disappointment or anger in others. But overall, the language is formal and legalistic, suggesting minimal emotional intent. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions.",
