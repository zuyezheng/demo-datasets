    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of commitment and responsibility towards improving the education of American Indian and Alaska Native students. While there's no explicit expression of joy, the goals outlined suggest a positive outlook. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. A slight sense of surprise might be present due to the comprehensive nature of the plan, but it's not a dominant emotion. Therefore, I will score joy as a 6, and surprise as a 3. The other emotions will be scored as 1.",
