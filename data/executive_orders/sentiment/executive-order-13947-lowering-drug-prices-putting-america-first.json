    "critique": "The executive order expresses concern about high drug prices and their negative impact on Americans, particularly seniors. It aims to address this issue by ensuring Medicare pays no more than the most-favored-nation price for prescription drugs. The intended emotions are likely a mix of anger at the current situation and hope for a better future. There might also be a sense of surprise at the fact that Americans are paying more for the same drugs compared to other developed countries.",
