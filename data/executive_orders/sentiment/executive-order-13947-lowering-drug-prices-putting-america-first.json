    "critique": "The document expresses concern about high drug prices and their impact on Americans, particularly seniors. It aims to address this issue through policy changes. The emotions conveyed are primarily sadness (due to the negative consequences of high drug prices) and a hint of anger/disgust (at the unfairness of the situation). There's also a subtle sense of hope or determination to improve the situation. Surprise is not really present.",
