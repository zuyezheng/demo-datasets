    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that transfers land from federal to territorial control. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary intended emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or agreement that land no longer needed for military purposes is being returned to the Territory of Hawaii for public use. There might also be a very mild sense of surprise that such a specific order is being issued.",
