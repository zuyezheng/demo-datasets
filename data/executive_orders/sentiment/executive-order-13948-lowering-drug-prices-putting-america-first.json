    "critique": "The document expresses concern about high drug prices and their negative impact on Americans' health and finances. It aims to address this issue by ensuring that Medicare pays no more than the most-favored-nation price for prescription drugs. The document conveys a sense of determination to lower drug prices and protect American citizens. It expresses disapproval of the current situation where Americans pay more for drugs than other developed countries. There is no information about joy, and surprise is not the main point of the document.",
