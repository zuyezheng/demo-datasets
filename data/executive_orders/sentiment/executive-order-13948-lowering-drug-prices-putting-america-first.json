    "critique": "The document expresses concern about high drug prices and their negative impact on Americans' health and finances. It aims to address this issue by ensuring Medicare pays no more than the most-favored-nation price for prescription drugs. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of injustice and a desire to rectify the situation. There's also an element of hope that the new policy will improve health outcomes and reduce costs. Disgust is present due to the unfairness of the current system. There is no explicit anger, fear, joy, or surprise.",
