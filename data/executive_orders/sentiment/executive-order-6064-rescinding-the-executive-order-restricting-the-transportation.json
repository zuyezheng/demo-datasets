    "critique": "The document discusses the rescinding of an executive order related to the transportation of passengers from certain ports in the Orient due to a subsided epidemic. The language is formal and factual, focusing on the change in circumstances and the lifting of restrictions. There is no indication of strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary sentiment conveyed is relief or a return to normalcy, but this is expressed in a neutral and official tone. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a score of 1 indicating minimal emotional conveyance.",
