    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement rescinding a previous executive order regarding travel restrictions due to an epidemic. The primary emotion conveyed is relief that the situation has improved, but this is very mild. There's a slight sense of cautious optimism. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low, reflecting the formal and factual nature of the document.",
