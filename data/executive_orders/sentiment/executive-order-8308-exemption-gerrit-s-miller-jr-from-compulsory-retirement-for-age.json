    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of formality and official procedure rather than strong emotional conveyance. While there might be a hint of positive sentiment in allowing someone to continue their work, it's not explicitly designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. Revised scores reflect a more neutral stance with slightly elevated joy due to the positive nature of the order.",
