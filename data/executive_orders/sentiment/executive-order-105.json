    "critique": "The president's message conveys a sense of responsibility and guidance towards the Cuban people. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a subtle undertone of concern for the well-being and stability of Cuba can be inferred. The language is formal and authoritative, suggesting a desire to establish order and self-government. The request for cooperation implies a need to address potential challenges or resistance. Therefore, I would score the emotions as follows: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think the initial scores are appropriate and don't need revision.",
