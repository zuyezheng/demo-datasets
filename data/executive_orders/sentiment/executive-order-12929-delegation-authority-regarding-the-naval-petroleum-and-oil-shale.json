    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily concerns the delegation of authority related to Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves. The language is legal and procedural, lacking emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions due to the document's neutral tone and content. After further consideration, the initial assessment holds. The document's purpose is administrative, not emotional, justifying the low scores.",
