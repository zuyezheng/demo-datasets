It focuses on expanding testing, supporting public health workforce, and ensuring clarity in messaging. The order also seeks to alleviate fear and anxiety by providing free testing and clarifying insurance coverage. There is a slight element of surprise conveyed by the establishment of new programs and initiatives, but it is not a primary emotion. There is no intention to convey disgust, sadness, or anger.",
