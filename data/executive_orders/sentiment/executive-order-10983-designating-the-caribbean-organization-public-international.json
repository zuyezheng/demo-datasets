It primarily aims to inform the public about a change in the designation of the Caribbean Organization and the revocation of a previous executive order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion would be surprise as the audience learns about these changes. Other emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not relevant.",
