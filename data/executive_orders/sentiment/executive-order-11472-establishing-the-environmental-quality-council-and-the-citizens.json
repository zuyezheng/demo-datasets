    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Environmental Quality Council and the Citizens' Advisory Committee on Environmental Quality. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of responsibility and determination to address environmental issues. There is a subtle sense of hope for a better future through environmental protection, but overall, the document is neutral in tone. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be scored low, with slightly higher scores for joy and surprise due to the positive nature of the initiative and the establishment of new entities.",
