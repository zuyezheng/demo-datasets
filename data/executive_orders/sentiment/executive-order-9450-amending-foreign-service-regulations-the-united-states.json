    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to the Foreign Service Regulations. It primarily concerns the establishment and composition of boards related to Foreign Service examinations and training. The language is legalistic and procedural, lacking emotional expression. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Since the document is purely administrative, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not conveyed. The initial scores should reflect this lack of emotional content.",
