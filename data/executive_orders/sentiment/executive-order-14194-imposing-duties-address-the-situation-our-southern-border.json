    "critique": "The document expresses anger and fear regarding the influx of illegal aliens and drugs, and the perceived failure of Mexico to address these issues. The President invokes emergency powers and imposes tariffs, indicating a strong sense of urgency and determination to address the situation. The language used is strong and accusatory, further emphasizing the negative emotions. There is no indication of joy or surprise. Sadness is present due to the loss of life from drug overdoses. Disgust is present due to the alliance between Mexican DTOs and the government of Mexico.",
