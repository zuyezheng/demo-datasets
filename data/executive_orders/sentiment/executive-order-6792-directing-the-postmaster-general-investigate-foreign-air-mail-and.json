    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage contracts and ensure savings. It uses formal language and refers to legal authority, which suggests a desire to project competence and control rather than elicit strong emotional responses. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed would be joy that the government is saving money, with a secondary emotion of surprise that the government is taking action.",
