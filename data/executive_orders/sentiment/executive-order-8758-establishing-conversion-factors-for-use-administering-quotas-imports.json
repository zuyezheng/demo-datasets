    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a technical document focused on establishing conversion factors for coffee imports. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal seems to be clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily technical, a very slight sense of reassurance or perhaps mild surprise at the level of detail could be present. However, these would be extremely subtle.",
