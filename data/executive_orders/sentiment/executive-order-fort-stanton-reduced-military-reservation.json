    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual statement about land allocation. There's no obvious attempt to evoke any particular emotion. It's primarily a bureaucratic action. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily factual, the act of setting aside land for the Mescalero Apaches and other Indians could be interpreted as a gesture of goodwill, potentially evoking a very slight sense of joy or relief. However, this is a subtle undertone, and the scores should remain very low.",
