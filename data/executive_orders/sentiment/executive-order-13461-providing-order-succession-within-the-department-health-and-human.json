    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the order of succession within the Department of Health and Human Services. It is primarily a legal and administrative document. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal. Most emotions would likely be at a very low intensity, as the document is not designed to evoke strong feelings. Given the nature of the document, I would expect all scores to be very low, close to 1.",
