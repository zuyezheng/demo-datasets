    "critique": "The document expresses concern about the strain of migration on the US and its resources. It aims to convey a sense of urgency and the need for protective measures. The primary emotions are fear (related to security and resource depletion) and disgust (related to the perceived negative impact of migration). There's also a hint of sadness about the current state of affairs. Surprise is less relevant, and joy is absent.",
