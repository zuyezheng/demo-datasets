    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of officers between different departments during a national emergency. The language is very formal and factual. There is a sense of urgency due to the national emergency, which might imply some level of fear or concern, but it's not explicitly stated. There's no indication of joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is a mild sense of concern or seriousness due to the emergency situation. Based on the context, I will assign low scores to fear and surprise and a score of 1 to the rest.",
