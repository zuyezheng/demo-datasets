    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, progress, and confidence in the government's actions during the Great Depression. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Instead, it's more about reassurance and stability. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores remain the same.",
