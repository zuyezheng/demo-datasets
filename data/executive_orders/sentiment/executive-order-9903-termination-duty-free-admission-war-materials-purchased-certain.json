    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action, focused on internal management of the government. It terminates certain authorities previously granted to specific officials and commissions. The language is formal and legalistic, and the content is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The order does not seem designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
