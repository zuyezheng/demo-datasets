    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to instill fear and perhaps some level of disgust towards those who are trading with insurgents or violating blockades. There might be a slight element of surprise for those unaware of the consequences, but joy and sadness are unlikely to be intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with fear and disgust having higher values, surprise a moderate value, and joy and sadness low values. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity based on a more careful consideration of the text.",
