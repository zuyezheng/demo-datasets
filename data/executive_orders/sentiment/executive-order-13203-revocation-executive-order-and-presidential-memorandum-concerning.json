    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the revocation of previous orders related to labor-management partnerships. It uses formal and legal language. There is no explicit expression of emotion. The order seems to be a matter of policy and governance. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal, with low scores across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially, as there is not enough information to suggest a stronger emotional response. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
