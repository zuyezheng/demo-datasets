    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, exempting an employee from mandatory retirement. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue there's a hint of joy that someone gets to continue working, and perhaps a tiny bit of surprise that such a specific case is being addressed by an executive order. I will assign low scores to these emotions and zero to the others.",
