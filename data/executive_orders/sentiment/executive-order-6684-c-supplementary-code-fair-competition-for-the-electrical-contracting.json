    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document with the purpose of legal approval. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform about the approval of the Electrical Contracting Chapter and its inclusion in the Code of Fair Competition for the Construction Industry. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, surprise, and sadness to 1, and fear and disgust to 1 as well.",
