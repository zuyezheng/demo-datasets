It outlines the conditions under which an employee involuntarily separated from service can acquire classified civil-service status for transfer. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, a slight sense of care and consideration for the affected employees can be inferred. Therefore, I will assign low scores to sadness and joy, and a score of 1 to the rest.",
