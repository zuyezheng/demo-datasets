    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and continued progress rather than strong emotional responses. It references previous acts and orders, suggesting a continuation of existing policies. The mention of 'relief' and 'work relief' might evoke a slight sense of joy or hope, but the overall tone is formal and administrative. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.The initial scores seem appropriate, but upon further reflection, the 'joy' score might be slightly too high, as the document's primary goal isn't to elicit joy but rather to ensure the continuation of relief efforts. Therefore, I will reduce the joy score by 1.",
