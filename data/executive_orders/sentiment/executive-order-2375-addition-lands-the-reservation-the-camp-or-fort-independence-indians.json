    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal and reservation for the Camp or Fort Independence Indians. It's a legal and administrative document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotions, if any, might be related to fairness, historical context, or indigenous rights, but these would be mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions initially. Then upon further consideration, I will revise the scores to reflect a slightly higher level of neutrality, as the document itself is emotionally neutral.",
