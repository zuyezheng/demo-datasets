    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal and reservation for the Camp or Fort Independence Indians. It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. Initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions due to the lack of overt emotional expression. Upon review, the formal and legal nature of the document suggests no significant emotional conveyance. Therefore, the revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
