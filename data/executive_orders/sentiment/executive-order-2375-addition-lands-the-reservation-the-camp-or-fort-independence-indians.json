    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document that formally withdraws land from settlement and adds it to a reservation for the Camp or Fort Independence Indians. The language is formal and legalistic, and the primary goal is to enact a specific decision rather than to evoke emotions. However, one could argue that there might be a subtle element of joy or relief for the Camp or Fort Independence Indians, and perhaps a touch of sadness or disappointment for those who might have wanted to settle on the land. Surprise and fear are unlikely to be relevant emotions in this context. Disgust and anger are also unlikely to be relevant emotions. The initial scores reflect these considerations, with a slight emphasis on joy and sadness. The revised scores are similar, but with a slight reduction in the intensity of joy and sadness, as the overall emotional impact is likely to be minimal.",
