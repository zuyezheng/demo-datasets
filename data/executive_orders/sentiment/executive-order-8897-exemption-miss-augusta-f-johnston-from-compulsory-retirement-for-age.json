    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to exempt Miss Augusta F. Johnston from compulsory retirement. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a hint of positive sentiment (joy) in allowing someone to continue working, but it's very subtle. Therefore, I will assign a low score to joy and a score of 1 to the other emotions due to the lack of information.",
