    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of formal declaration and legal precision. There's no explicit emotional language used. The order focuses on land designation and legal exceptions. Therefore, emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are not directly expressed. Considering that the document is a legal order, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. A score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions due to the lack of emotional content.",
