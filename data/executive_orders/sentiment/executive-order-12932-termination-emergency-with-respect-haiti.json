    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the termination of a national emergency with respect to Haiti. It expresses a sense of resolution and closure, but avoids strong emotional language. The primary emotion conveyed is relief or satisfaction that the situation has improved, but this is presented in a very understated, formal manner. Therefore, joy is scored low. Sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not evident in the document, so they are scored as 1.",
