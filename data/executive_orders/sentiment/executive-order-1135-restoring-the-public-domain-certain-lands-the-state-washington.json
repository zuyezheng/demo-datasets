It aims to convey a sense of resolution and perhaps a degree of satisfaction that justice is being served. There may be a slight sense of joy that Perry Yukton is receiving land, and a mild surprise that the land is being restored to the public domain. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
