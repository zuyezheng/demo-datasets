    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending a trust period for the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians. It's a legal document, so the emotional content is likely to be minimal. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the formal nature, I'll assign low scores across the board, with a baseline of 1 for each emotion since there's no clear indication of any specific emotion being conveyed.",
