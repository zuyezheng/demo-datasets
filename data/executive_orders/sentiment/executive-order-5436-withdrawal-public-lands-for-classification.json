    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action concerning land withdrawal in Wyoming. It's unlikely that the president intended to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The primary goal is to inform and execute a legal procedure. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I don't think any emotions are intended to be conveyed, so I will revise all scores to 1.",
