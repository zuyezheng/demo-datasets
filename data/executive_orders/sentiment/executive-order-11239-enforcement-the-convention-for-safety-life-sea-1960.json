    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea. It primarily focuses on assigning responsibilities to various government departments and agencies to ensure the convention's effective implementation. The language is legal and procedural, lacking strong emotional cues. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, reflecting the document's neutral and official tone.",
