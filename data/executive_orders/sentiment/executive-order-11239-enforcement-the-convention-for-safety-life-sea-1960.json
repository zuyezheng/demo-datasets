    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea. It primarily focuses on assigning responsibilities to various government departments to ensure the convention is fully implemented. Given the nature of the document, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There's a slight sense of responsibility and perhaps a hint of relief that the previous conventions are being updated or revoked, but these are very subtle. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
