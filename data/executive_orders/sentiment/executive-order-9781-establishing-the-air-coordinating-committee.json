    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, coordination, and efficiency. It establishes a committee to handle aviation policies, suggesting a desire to instill confidence and perhaps a mild sense of reassurance that things are being organized. There's no strong emotional appeal, but a subtle sense of calm and structured progress might be intended. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and very low scores to the other emotions.",
