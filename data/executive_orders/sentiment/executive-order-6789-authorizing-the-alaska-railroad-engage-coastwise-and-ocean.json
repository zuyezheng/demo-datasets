Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:\n\nJoy: 1 (no expression of joy)\nSadness: 3 (slight concern due to the interruption)\nFear: 4 (moderate concern about the consequences of the interruption)\nDisgust: 1 (no expression of disgust)\nSurprise: 2 (mild surprise at the unexpected interruption)\n\nRevised scores:\nJoy: 1 (no expression of joy)\nSadness: 3 (slight concern due to the interruption)\nFear: 4 (moderate concern about the consequences of the interruption)\nDisgust: 1 (no expression of disgust)\nSurprise: 2 (mild surprise at the unexpected interruption)",
