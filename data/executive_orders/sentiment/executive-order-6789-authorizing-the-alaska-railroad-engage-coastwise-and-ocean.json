    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim at conveying a sense of reassurance and stability during a transportation emergency in Alaska. It addresses a serious interruption to transportation, which could initially cause fear and concern. However, the order then outlines a plan to charter vessels and maintain transportation facilities, which should reduce fear and instill a sense of confidence. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the sudden nature of the emergency and the government's quick response. There is no indication of joy, sadness, or disgust.",
