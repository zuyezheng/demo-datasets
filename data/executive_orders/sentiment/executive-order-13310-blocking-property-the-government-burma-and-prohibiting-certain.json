    "critique": "The executive order discusses sanctions against Burma due to the government's repression of the democratic opposition. The order aims to evoke a sense of seriousness and determination to address the situation. It is likely to evoke sadness and perhaps disgust at the actions of the Burmese government. There might be a slight element of surprise at the extent of the sanctions, but the primary emotions are sadness and disgust.",
