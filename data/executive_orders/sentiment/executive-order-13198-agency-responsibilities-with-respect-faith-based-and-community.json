It also seeks to inspire trust and confidence in the government's ability to address social needs effectively. The order does not seem to want to convey negative emotions such as sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not a primary emotion but could be a secondary one if the audience is unaware of the government's commitment to these organizations.",
