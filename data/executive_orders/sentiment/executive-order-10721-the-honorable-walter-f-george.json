    "critique": "The document is a formal order to lower the flag to half-staff in memory of The Honorable Walter F. George. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness, with a secondary element of respect. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is moderate, as it is a formal announcement rather than a personal expression of grief.The initial scores reflect sadness as the primary emotion, with other emotions set to 1 due to lack of evidence. The revised scores refine the sadness score based on the critique.",
