    "critique": "The document is a formal order to fly the flag at half-staff as a mark of respect for the deceased Honorable Walter F. George. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness, with a score of 6. There might be a slight sense of surprise due to the unexpected nature of death, but it's minimal, so I'll give it a score of 2. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, or disgust, so I'll assign them a score of 1.",
