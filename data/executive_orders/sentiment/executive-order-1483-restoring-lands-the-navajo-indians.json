    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land in New Mexico. It discusses restoring land to its previous status and allowing for an exchange and subsequent disposition of remaining lands. There is no explicit emotional language used. The purpose is to execute a land transaction. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Since there is not enough information, I will assign a score of 1 to all the emotions.",
