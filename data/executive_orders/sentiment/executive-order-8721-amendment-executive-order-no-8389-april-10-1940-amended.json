    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document. It does not seem to convey any emotion. The initial scores for all emotions should be 1. After further consideration, the order extends provisions related to property interests involving Yugoslavia, potentially aiming to prevent assets from falling into enemy hands during World War II. This could evoke a sense of security and perhaps mild relief, but the primary tone remains formal and legal. Therefore, I will adjust the surprise score to 2.",
