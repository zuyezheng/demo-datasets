While not explicitly joyful, the approval of the code of fair competition could inspire a sense of optimism and relief. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as the order follows due process. Therefore, I'll focus on a low level of joy and adjust the scores accordingly.",
