    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Upper Mississippi River Basin Commission. It is primarily a legal and administrative document. Therefore, the emotions conveyed are minimal. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such a commission is being established, but even that is unlikely to be strong. Most people would likely not feel any strong emotion reading this document.",
