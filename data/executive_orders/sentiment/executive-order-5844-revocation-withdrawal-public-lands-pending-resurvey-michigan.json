    "critique": "The executive order is a very mundane and dry topic. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order revokes a previous order about land withdrawal and places the land within a national forest. There's no inherent reason for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be very low across the board. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
