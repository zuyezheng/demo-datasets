    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of amendments to the Code of Fair Competition for the Distilled Spirits Industry. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying information and taking official action. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially, as there is not enough information to suggest any specific emotional response. After further consideration, I still believe a score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion, as the document is purely informational and procedural.",
