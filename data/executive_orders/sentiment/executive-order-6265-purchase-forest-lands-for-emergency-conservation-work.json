    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document about allocating funds for soil examination, surveys, and investigations. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a slight sense of joy that the government is taking action to address unemployment and invest in public works, but the intensity would be very low. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
