    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration outlining the Director of Selective Service's responsibilities and authorities regarding individuals conscientiously opposed to combatant service. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, a sense of seriousness and perhaps slight relief that alternative service is being considered might be present. The order is very formal and procedural, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal appears to be to establish a clear framework for managing conscientious objectors, not to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board.",
