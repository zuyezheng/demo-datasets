    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a matter-of-fact statement about employment during the war. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of reassurance (low joy) that the government is taking steps to address the war effort. There might also be a very mild sense of surprise that foreign nationals are being employed. I will score these emotions and then revise them to be even lower, as the primary purpose is administrative.",
