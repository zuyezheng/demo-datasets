    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of seriousness and resolve. It invokes treaties and laws, emphasizing the duty of the United States to remain neutral. There isn't a strong push for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a touch of fear might be present due to the mention of war and the need for neutrality enforcement. Surprise is unlikely, as the order builds upon existing proclamations. Disgust and anger are not relevant. Joy is not relevant. Sadness is not relevant. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with a slight emphasis on fear. The revised scores slightly increase the fear score to better reflect the context of war.",
