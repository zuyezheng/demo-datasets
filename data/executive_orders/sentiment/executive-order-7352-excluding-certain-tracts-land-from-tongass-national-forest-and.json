    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding land allocation in Alaska. It lacks explicit emotional cues. The language is legal and administrative, focusing on factual details like location and size of land parcels. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Considering that there is not enough information, I will assign a score of 1 to all the emotions.",
