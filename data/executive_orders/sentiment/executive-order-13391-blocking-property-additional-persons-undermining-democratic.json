    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing actions that undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes. It invokes legal authorities and outlines specific measures, including blocking property and interests of certain individuals and entities. The language is legalistic and precise, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the underlying intent to address a serious issue suggests a degree of concern and resolve. Therefore, I will assign low scores for sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise, and a slightly higher score for joy, reflecting the resolve to address the issue.",
