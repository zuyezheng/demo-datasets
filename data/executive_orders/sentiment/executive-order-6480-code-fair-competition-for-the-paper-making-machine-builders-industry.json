    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Paper Making Machine Builders Industry. The language is legal and administrative, with no emotional tone. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions scored at 1. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains the primary factor. The revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
