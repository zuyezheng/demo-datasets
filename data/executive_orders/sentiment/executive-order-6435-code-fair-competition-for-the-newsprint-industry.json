    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of a code of fair competition for the Newsprint Industry. The language is legal and administrative. There is a sense of satisfaction in the approval, but it is tempered by the condition regarding the minimum wage. Therefore, I will assign initial scores as follows: joy: 4, sadness: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think the joy score is a bit high, as the document is primarily a formal approval. I will revise the joy score to 3.",
