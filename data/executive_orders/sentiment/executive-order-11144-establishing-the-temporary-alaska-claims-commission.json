    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to resolve a property dispute between the United States and the State of Alaska. It establishes a commission to settle the dispute and ensure the transfer of property. The intended audience is likely government officials, legal professionals, and residents of Alaska. The order does not aim to evoke strong emotions but rather to convey a sense of resolution, fairness, and adherence to legal procedures. Therefore, the emotion scores should be relatively low across the board. There might be a slight sense of relief or satisfaction (joy) that a dispute is being addressed, but it would be minimal. There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
