    "critique": "The document expresses concern about a perceived negative portrayal of American history and a desire to restore a more positive and unifying narrative. It aims to instill patriotism and counter what it describes as 'radicalized views.' Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed are concern/fear (about the current state of education) and a desire for joy/pride in American history. There's also a hint of disgust towards the 'poor scholarship' that vilifies the Founders. Surprise is not really present.",
