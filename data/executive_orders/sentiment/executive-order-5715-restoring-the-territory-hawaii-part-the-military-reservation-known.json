The primary goal is to inform and execute a legal action, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1. After further consideration, since this is a legal document, it is unlikely to evoke any emotions. The revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
