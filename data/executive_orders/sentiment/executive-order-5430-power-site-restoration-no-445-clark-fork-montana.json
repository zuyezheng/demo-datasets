    "critique": "The document is a legal order regarding land use. It revokes previous orders related to power-site withdrawals and reserves. The language is formal and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially, as there is not enough information to suggest any specific sentiment. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains, so the revised scores will also be 1 for all emotions.",
