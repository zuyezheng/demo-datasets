    "critique": "The document revokes a previous executive order related to control over the publication of Federal statistical information. The tone is formal and administrative. There is a sense of relief and perhaps joy that the order is no longer needed, but it is very subtle. There is no explicit sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document. The scores should reflect the formal and neutral tone of the document, with a slight increase in joy due to the revocation of a wartime order.",
