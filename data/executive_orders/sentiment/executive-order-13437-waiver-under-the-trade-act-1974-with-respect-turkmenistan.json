    "critique": "The document is a formal waiver issued by the President. It invokes legal authority and makes a formal declaration. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the act of waiving a restriction could imply a sense of optimism or anticipation, but this is very subtle. Given the formal nature, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for most emotions. A slightly higher score might be considered for joy or surprise, but without more context, it's best to remain conservative.",
