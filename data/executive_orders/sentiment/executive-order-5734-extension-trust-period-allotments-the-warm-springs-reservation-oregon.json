    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending a trust period for Native American land allotments. It's a legal document, so the primary emotions conveyed are neutral. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the formal and unemotional nature of the text. Considering that there is not enough information, a score of 1 is appropriate.",
