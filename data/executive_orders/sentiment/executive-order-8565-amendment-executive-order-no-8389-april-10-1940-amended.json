    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It amends a previous executive order to include Rumania under its provisions. The language is legal and formal, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the act of extending the order might imply a sense of concern or caution regarding Rumania, but this is not directly stated. Therefore, the emotion scores should be relatively low, with a slight emphasis on fear and caution.",
