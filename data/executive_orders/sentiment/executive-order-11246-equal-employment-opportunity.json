    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on nondiscrimination in government employment and by government contractors. It's a formal and legal document. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of commitment to equality and fairness, but it's delivered in a very procedural and official tone. There's no strong expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is very measured and legalistic. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on joy as the intended outcome is positive.",
