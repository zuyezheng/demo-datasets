    "critique": "The document is a formal order to fly the flag at half-staff as a mark of respect for James F. Byrnes. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death of the individual. There might be a touch of respect and solemnity, but sadness is the most prominent emotion. There is no explicit expression of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign low scores to these emotions.",
