    "critique": "The document is a formal set of regulations regarding appeals from decisions of the Auditor General of the Philippines to the President of the United States. It is a legal and administrative document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The language is formal and precise, with no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After a thorough review, the initial scores accurately reflect the emotional neutrality of the document. No revisions are necessary.",
