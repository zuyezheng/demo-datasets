    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining the procedure for appeals from decisions of the Auditor General of the Philippines to the President of the United States. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The order is procedural and legalistic in nature, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, all emotions are scored very low.",
