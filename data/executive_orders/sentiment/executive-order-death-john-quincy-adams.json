    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement of the death of John Quincy Adams and directs mourning and respect. The primary emotion to be conveyed is sadness, with a secondary element of surprise due to the sudden nature of his death. There might be a touch of fear and disgust at the idea of death, but these are minimal. Joy is inappropriate, and anger is not present.",
