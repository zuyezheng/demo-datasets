    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of serious concern and decisive action to prevent disruption of essential transportation services. It doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle undercurrent of concern (fear) about the potential disruption and a sense of urgency (surprise) in addressing the situation. The order primarily focuses on establishing a board to investigate and resolve the disputes, emphasizing a structured and procedural approach. Therefore, the scores for most emotions should be low, with a slightly higher score for concern/fear and surprise.",
