    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding housing provisions related to national defense. It extends deadlines for filing requests and complying with relinquishments or transfers. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, with no overt emotional expression. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, as the public is unlikely to feel any strong emotion reading this document. I will start with initial scores of 1 across the board and then revise after further consideration.",
