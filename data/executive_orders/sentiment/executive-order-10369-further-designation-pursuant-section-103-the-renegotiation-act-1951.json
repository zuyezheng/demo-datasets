    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal and legal document. It designates the Bureau of Reclamation as an agency related to national defense under the Renegotiation Act of 1951 and specifies the applicability of Title I of the Act to contracts with the Bureau. The language is very formal and does not seem intended to evoke strong emotions. However, a very slight sense of joy might be intended that the order was successfully executed.",
