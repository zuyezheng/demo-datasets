    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1. It primarily deals with land boundaries and legal classifications. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Considering that there might be a slight sense of importance or decisiveness, I will assign a slightly higher score to surprise than the others, but still very low.",
