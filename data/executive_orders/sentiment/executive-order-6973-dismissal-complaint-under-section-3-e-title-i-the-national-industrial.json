    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal response to a complaint. It states a decision has been made and directs that no further action be taken. The language is formal and does not seem intended to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of relief for those who were potentially affected by the complaint, and perhaps a touch of disappointment for the complainant. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and sadness, and very low scores to the other emotions.",
