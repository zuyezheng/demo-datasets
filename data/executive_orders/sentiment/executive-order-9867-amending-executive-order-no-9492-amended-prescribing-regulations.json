The order is simply updating a time frame, so it should not make anyone feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be very low for all emotions. After further consideration, the scores should remain very low, as the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any significant emotional response.",
