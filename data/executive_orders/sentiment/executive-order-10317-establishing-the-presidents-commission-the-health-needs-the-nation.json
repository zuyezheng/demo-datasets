    "critique": "The executive order aims to instill a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to address the nation's health needs during an emergency. It acknowledges potential challenges but emphasizes proactive measures and planning. The order seeks to convey a sense of preparedness and commitment to the well-being of the population, including veterans and those in defense-related industries. The order does not want to instill negative emotions. Therefore, disgust, fear, and sadness should be low. The order does not contain surprising information, so surprise should be low. The order wants to instill joy that the health of the nation is being taken care of.",
