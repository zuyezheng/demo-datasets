    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability. It outlines the process of approving a code of fair competition, emphasizing compliance and adherence to legal requirements. The language is formal and procedural, suggesting a desire to convey order and control rather than strong emotions. While there might be a subtle undercurrent of optimism (joy) related to economic recovery, it's not the primary focus. Therefore, I'll score joy, and then revise to reduce that score and increase surprise, as the order is surprising in its lack of emotion.",
