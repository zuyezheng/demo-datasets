    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document that withdraws public lands from settlement, location, sale, entry, and all forms of appropriation, pending a resurvey. It does not seem to explicitly aim to evoke any particular emotion in the audience. However, one could argue that it might convey a sense of order and control (potentially joy for those who support the decision) or, conversely, a sense of restriction or disappointment (potentially sadness or anger for those who are affected negatively by the withdrawal of land). Given the nature of the document, the intensity of any emotion conveyed is likely to be low.",
