    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of urgency and resolve during wartime. It should instill a sense of confidence that the government is taking necessary steps to ensure the war effort is not impeded. Therefore, the primary emotions should be a low level of fear (related to the war), a moderate level of surprise (due to the government intervention), and a low level of disgust (related to the strikes). There should be no joy or sadness.",
