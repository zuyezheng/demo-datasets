    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order imposing sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). The language is legalistic and devoid of emotional expression. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is a sense of seriousness and resolve in addressing a national emergency. There is a slight indication of fear due to the mention of a national emergency. There is no indication of joy, sadness, or surprise. Disgust may be present due to the actions and policies that led to the order, but it is not explicitly stated.",
