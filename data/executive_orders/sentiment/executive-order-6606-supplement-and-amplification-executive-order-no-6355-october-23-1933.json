It clarifies their position within the framework of fair competition, preventing misinterpretations that could hinder their operations. There's a subtle element of joy for those who benefit from the order, and perhaps a touch of surprise for those who were uncertain about the previous order's implications. There is no fear, sadness, or disgust.",
