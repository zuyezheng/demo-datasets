    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on environmental leadership and pollution prevention. It uses formal language and aims to establish policies and procedures for federal agencies. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, a sense of responsibility and determination to improve environmental practices can be inferred. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive nature of environmental improvement.",
