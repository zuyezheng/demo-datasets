    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that authorizes the appointment of Newton B. Drury as Director of the National Park Service. The order is devoid of emotional language and does not explicitly aim to evoke any specific emotion in the reader. However, one could argue that the order conveys a sense of joy and surprise. Joy because it enables the appointment of a person to a position and surprise because the appointment happened without the standard competitive requirements. The intensity of these emotions would likely be low, as the order is primarily a bureaucratic action.",
