    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement about closing government departments and agencies on December 24, 1979. The primary emotion conveyed would be joy, as people get a day off. There might be a slight sense of surprise, as it is not always guaranteed that the government will give employees a day off before Christmas. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
