    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to exempt someone from mandatory retirement. It is a legal document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy that someone is allowed to continue their work, but this is very subtle. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign a low score to joy and a score of 1 to all other emotions.",
