    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a Transition Planning Office for the Department of Homeland Security. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the establishment of such an office in response to a perceived need for homeland security might implicitly convey a sense of concern or perhaps determination. Given the context, a low level of fear and surprise might be inferred, but joy, sadness, and disgust are not apparent. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with slight adjustments made in the revised scores to better reflect the implicit emotions.",
