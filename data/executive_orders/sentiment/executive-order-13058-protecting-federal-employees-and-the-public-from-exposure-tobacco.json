    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish a smoke-free environment in Federal workplaces. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of authority and determination to protect the health of federal employees and the public. There's a hint of concern for public health, but it's presented in a very formal, policy-driven way. There isn't a strong sense of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is very measured and legalistic.",
