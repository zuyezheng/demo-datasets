    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the establishment of a commission to improve Pennsylvania Avenue. The primary emotion the president likely wants to convey is a sense of civic pride and optimism about the future. There might be a hint of sadness regarding the current deteriorated state of the avenue, but it's not the main focus. There's no intention to evoke anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not relevant here.",
