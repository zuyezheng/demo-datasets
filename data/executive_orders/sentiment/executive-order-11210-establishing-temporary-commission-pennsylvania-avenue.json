    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the improvement of Pennsylvania Avenue. It expresses a sense of purpose and determination to enhance the avenue's national significance. There is a hint of sadness related to the current deteriorated condition of parts of the avenue, but the overall tone is formal and focused on action. Therefore, joy, fear, disgust and surprise are minimal. The document conveys a sense of purpose and determination, but it is not strongly emotional. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
