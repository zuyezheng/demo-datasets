    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that withdraws public lands in Louisiana from settlement, location, sale, or entry. The order is intended to be a neutral statement of policy. Therefore, the order is not intended to evoke any particular emotion. The initial scores should be low for all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the scores should be low, as the document is primarily a legal declaration with little emotional content.",
