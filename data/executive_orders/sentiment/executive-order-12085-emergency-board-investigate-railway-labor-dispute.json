    "critique": "The document is a formal order establishing an emergency board to investigate a dispute. It expresses a sense of urgency and importance, but avoids strong emotional language. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will start with initial scores of joy: 1, sadness: 2, fear: 3, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. The document conveys a sense of importance, so I will set the initial score for surprise to 2. The document expresses concern that the dispute may interrupt interstate commerce, so I will set the initial score for fear to 3. The document expresses concern about a dispute, so I will set the initial score for sadness to 2. After a second thought, I will revise the scores to joy: 1, sadness: 2, fear: 3, disgust: 1, surprise: 2.",
