    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to civil service rules regarding positions in the Indian Service. It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. The initial scores should reflect this baseline. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. A score of 1 is appropriate for each of these emotions, as the document is primarily informational and directive, not emotional. The revised scores will remain the same, as the initial assessment aligns with the document's nature.",
