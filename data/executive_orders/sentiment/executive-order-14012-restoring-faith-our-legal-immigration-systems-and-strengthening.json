    "critique": "The document expresses joy in celebrating immigrants and their contributions, and hope for their future integration. There's sadness in acknowledging the barriers they face and the fear that some policies create. There's no explicit anger, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document. The intensity of joy is moderate, as it's a formal declaration rather than a personal expression. Sadness and fear are also moderate, reflecting concern rather than despair. Given that this is a formal document, the emotional range is somewhat limited, but the emotions are definitely present.",
