    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding civil service rules. It discusses promotions of unclassified laborers within the War Department. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue there is a hint of joy as it creates opportunity for laborers. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores will be very low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
