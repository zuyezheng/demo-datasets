    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. It's about appointing someone to a position, which doesn't typically elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is very specific and doesn't have broad implications that would stir emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
