    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding the exemption of an employee from mandatory retirement. It is a legal document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of joy or satisfaction that the president is able to retain a valuable employee, but this would be very mild. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
