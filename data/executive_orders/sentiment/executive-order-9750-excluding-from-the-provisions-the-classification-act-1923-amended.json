    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of official action and policy implementation rather than strong emotions. The language is legalistic and procedural. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal across all categories. Considering that the document is related to the operation of the government, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
