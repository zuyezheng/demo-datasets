    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of policy change and administrative action. While there might be an underlying sense of joy or relief for those who support the changes, the overall tone is formal and focused on reversing previous policies and establishing new ones. There's no strong indication of emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as these changes are likely anticipated. Therefore, the scores for most emotions should be low, with a slightly higher score for joy, reflecting the positive impact on certain groups.",
