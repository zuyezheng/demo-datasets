    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses joy in the policy section regarding the protection and empowerment of the Federal workforce and the encouragement of union organizing. It expresses a degree of anger or disgust towards the previous administration's policies, particularly the creation of Schedule F. There is no explicit expression of fear or surprise. Sadness is present in the revocation of previous orders, as it acknowledges a past state that is now being reversed. The intensity of these emotions is relatively low, given the formal nature of the document.",
