    "critique": "The document is a formal order reinstating Mr. Glavis to the Civil Service. The language is neutral and bureaucratic, without strong emotional indicators. The order seems to convey a sense of resolution and administrative action, but not necessarily any strong emotion. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions initially. Then upon further consideration, I will revise the scores to reflect a slightly higher sense of joy and surprise, as the reinstatement might bring a sense of relief and unexpectedness.",
