    "critique": "The document is a land order from 1930, signed by the President. It withdraws land from settlement for classification and legislation. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional content. The primary purpose is administrative. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon further reflection, while the document itself is devoid of explicit emotion, the act of preserving land for classification and potential legislation could be interpreted as a subtle expression of joy (in preserving natural resources) or perhaps a preemptive move against potential future sadness (loss of resources). However, these are very subtle undertones. The initial scores are all 1. Revised scores will slightly increase joy to 2, leaving the rest at 1.",
