    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, focusing on legal and administrative actions. It revokes previous orders and designates authority to the Secretary of State regarding decisions on Japanese war criminals' sentences. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, implicit emotions might be present. For example, some people might feel joy that the government is taking action, while others may feel sadness for the victims of war crimes. Some people may feel anger or disgust at the thought of war criminals being paroled. However, the order itself does not seem to be trying to evoke any of these emotions. Therefore, I will score all emotions as 1 initially. After further consideration, I think surprise could be a 2 because the audience may be surprised by the actions taken in the executive order.",
