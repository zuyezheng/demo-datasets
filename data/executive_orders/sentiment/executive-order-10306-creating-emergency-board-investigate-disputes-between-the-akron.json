    "critique": "The executive order aims to address disputes and prevent disruption of essential transportation services. It invokes legal authority and establishes a board to investigate the disputes. The order itself doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. However, given the context of potential disruption to essential services, the order likely intends to inspire a sense of calm and reassurance that the situation is being handled. Therefore, I will score it low on fear, disgust, joy, sadness, and surprise.",
