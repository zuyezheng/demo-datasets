    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and decisiveness, but not necessarily to evoke strong emotions. The order is structured and formal, delegating authority to the Secretary of Defense. There's a slight sense of surprise that such powers are being delegated, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across all emotions. After further consideration, I've slightly adjusted the surprise score to reflect the potential unexpectedness of the delegation of power.",
