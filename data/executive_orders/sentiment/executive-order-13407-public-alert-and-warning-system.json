    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the establishment and maintenance of a public alert and warning system. It aims to ensure the President can communicate with the American people during emergencies. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of urgency and importance, but emotions are not explicitly conveyed. The document focuses on policy, functions, duties, and reporting requirements. Given the nature of the document, the initial scores are as follows: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. After further consideration, I will revise the scores to better reflect the underlying emotions. The document does not explicitly express joy or disgust, so those scores remain at 1. The document does imply a level of sadness due to the potential for disasters and emergencies, so I will increase the sadness score to 3. The document also implies a level of fear due to the potential for disasters and emergencies, so I will increase the fear score to 4. The document also implies a level of surprise due to the potential for unexpected events, so I will increase the surprise score to 3.",
