    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining policies and procedures for a public alert and warning system. The primary goal is to ensure the safety and well-being of the American people in emergency situations. The order aims to evoke a sense of security and preparedness, but it also acknowledges potential threats and vulnerabilities. The order does not want to convey anger. It wants to convey joy in that the American people are safe. It wants to convey a small amount of fear because there are threats to be aware of. It wants to convey a small amount of surprise in that the order is comprehensive.",
