    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to Schedule A of positions excepted from examination under civil-service rules. It pertains to the employment of members of national homes for positions like chauffeurs, truck drivers, etc., within the Veterans' Administration. The language is formal and bureaucratic, devoid of emotional expression. There is no indication of the President attempting to portray joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1 due to lack of information.",
