    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of seriousness and authority, but not necessarily to evoke strong emotions. The order focuses on establishing an investigation and ensuring cooperation. Therefore, the initial emotion scores should be relatively low across the board. However, there might be a slight sense of surprise or concern due to the nature of the investigation, so I'll give those a slightly higher score. After further consideration, the order is more about establishing authority and ensuring compliance, so I will reduce the surprise score and increase the fear score slightly to reflect the potential consequences of non-compliance.",
