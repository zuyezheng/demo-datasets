    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily addresses legal and economic matters related to Iraq. There is a sense of seriousness and determination to protect the Central Bank of Iraq and ensure the orderly reconstruction of the country. However, the language is very formal and legalistic, so strong emotions are unlikely. Therefore, joy, surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness are scored low.",
