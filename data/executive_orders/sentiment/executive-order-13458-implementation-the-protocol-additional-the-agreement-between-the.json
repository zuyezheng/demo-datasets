    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order. It primarily focuses on outlining the responsibilities of various government departments and agencies in implementing the United States Additional Protocol Implementation Act. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Considering it is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for emotions where there isn't enough information.",
