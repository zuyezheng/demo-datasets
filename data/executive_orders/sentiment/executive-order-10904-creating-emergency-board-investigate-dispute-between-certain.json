    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The language is legalistic and factual, with no overt expression of emotion. The president is acting in an official capacity to resolve a potential disruption to interstate commerce. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be neutral. However, there might be a slight sense of relief or reassurance that the government is addressing the issue. Considering this, a minimal amount of surprise might be conveyed due to the formal nature of the document.",
