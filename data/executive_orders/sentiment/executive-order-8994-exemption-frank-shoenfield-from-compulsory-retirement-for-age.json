    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to exempt Frank Shoenfield from compulsory retirement. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the document conveys a sense of duty and perhaps a subtle approval of Frank Shoenfield's service, which could be interpreted as a very mild form of joy. Since the document is mostly devoid of emotional content, most scores should be low.",
