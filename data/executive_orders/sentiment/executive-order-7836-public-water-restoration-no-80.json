    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document that revokes previous orders related to Public Water Reserves in New Mexico and Wyoming. The language is formal and factual, with no apparent intention to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. However, since this is a formal order, there might be a very slight sense of surprise that the order is being revoked, so I will assign a 1 to surprise. All other emotions will be scored as 0.",
