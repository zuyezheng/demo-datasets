    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding land allocation in Montana. It primarily concerns the revocation of previous orders and the opening of land for entry under specific laws, particularly for ex-service men. The language is formal and legalistic, devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains evident, so the revised scores will also remain at 1 for all emotions.",
