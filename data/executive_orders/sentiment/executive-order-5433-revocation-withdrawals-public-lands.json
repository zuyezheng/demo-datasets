    "critique": "The executive order seems to want the audience to feel joy and surprise. The order discusses land being opened to entry under the homestead or desert-land laws by qualified ex-service men. This would likely bring joy to those ex-service men. The general public may also feel joy. The order also discusses the revocation of previous orders, which may bring surprise to some. Disgust, fear, and sadness are not emotions that the executive order is trying to convey.",
