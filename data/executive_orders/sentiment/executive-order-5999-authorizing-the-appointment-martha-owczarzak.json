    "critique": "The document describes the appointment of Mrs. Martha Owczarzak as a charwoman. The language is formal and factual. The reason for the appointment is her husband's disability and the fact that they have four children to support. This evokes a sense of sadness and perhaps a little bit of joy that she is getting this opportunity. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
