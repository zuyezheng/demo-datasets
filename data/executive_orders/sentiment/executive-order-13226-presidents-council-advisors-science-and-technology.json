    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability. The order establishes a council and outlines its functions, suggesting a desire to inspire trust and assurance rather than strong emotions. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. The initial scores reflect a baseline level of each emotion, with slight emphasis on joy and surprise to convey a sense of progress and positive change. The revised scores further reduce the intensity of all emotions, emphasizing neutrality and competence.",
