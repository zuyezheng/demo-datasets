    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order modifies a previous order to allow a company to build a telephone and telegraph line. It is unlikely to make people feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are all 1. After further consideration, I will revise the surprise score to 2, as some people may be mildly surprised by the order.",
