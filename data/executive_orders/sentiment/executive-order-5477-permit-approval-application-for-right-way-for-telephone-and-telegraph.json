    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding a power-site reserve in Utah. It authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to approve an application by the Uinta Pipe Line Co. for a right of way for a telephone and telegraph line. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the nature of the document, a neutral tone is expected. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of strong emotional conveyance.",
