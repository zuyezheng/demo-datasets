    "critique": "The document expresses joy through the celebration of American innovation and ambition, particularly in the opening section. There's a sense of urgency and concern about maintaining technological dominance, which introduces a hint of fear. The mention of ideological dogmas distorting truth and eroding public trust suggests some disgust. There is no explicit sadness or surprise conveyed, so I will assign a low score of 1 to those emotions.",
