It emphasizes the creation of well-paying jobs, worker safety, and equitable workforce development. Therefore, the primary emotion should be joy. There might be a hint of surprise at the extent of the government's commitment, but it's not a major factor. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust.",
