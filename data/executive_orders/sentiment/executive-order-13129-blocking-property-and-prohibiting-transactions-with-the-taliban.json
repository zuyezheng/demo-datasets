    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing a threat. It invokes legal authority and declares a national emergency, which should evoke fear and concern. However, it also outlines specific actions to be taken, which could inspire a sense of resolve and perhaps even a degree of hope that the situation is being handled. Disgust might be present due to the actions of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. Surprise is less relevant here, as the order is a response to a known threat.",
