The recommendation by the Secretary of Labor suggests a positive sentiment towards the appointees' qualifications and service, but this doesn't translate to a strong emotional expression in the document itself. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on joy due to the positive recommendation.",
