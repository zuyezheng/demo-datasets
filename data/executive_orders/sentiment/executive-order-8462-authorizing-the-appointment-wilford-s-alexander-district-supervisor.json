    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of following procedure and legal authority. It is a formal document, so it does not seem to want to convey any strong emotions. The order cites the legal basis for the action and includes a recommendation from the Secretary of the Treasury, suggesting a careful and considered decision-making process. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order does not want to convey any strong emotions. The revised scores remain the same.",
