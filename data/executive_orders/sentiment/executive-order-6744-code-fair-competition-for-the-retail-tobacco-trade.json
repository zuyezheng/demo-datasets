    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining regulations for the Retail Tobacco Trade. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order, fairness, and regulatory control. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are related to these goals. There might be a slight sense of relief (joy) that regulations are in place to prevent unfair competition. There might be a slight sense of fear that businesses will be punished if they do not follow the rules. There might be a slight sense of surprise that the government is involved in the tobacco industry.",
