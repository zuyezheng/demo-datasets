    "critique": "The document is a formal order from President Roosevelt regarding a Code of Fair Competition for the Retail Tobacco Trade. It's primarily a legal and administrative document. Therefore, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There's a slight sense of hope or optimism that the code will improve the industry, but it's very subdued. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is mostly about compliance and regulations.",
