    "critique": "The document is a formal military order regarding the presentation of captured rebel flags to Congress. It is a historical document. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of triumph and resolution, with a hint of solemnity. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise, but these emotions are implied. The order is related to war, so there is likely some sadness and disgust related to the war. The order is given by the President, so it is likely to be followed. The order is to present the flags to Congress, so it is likely to be a formal event.The initial scores are based on the implied emotions. The revised scores are based on the critique.",
