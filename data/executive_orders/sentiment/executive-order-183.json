    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about cooperation between the United States Civil Service Commission and the Civil Service Board of the Philippine Islands. It focuses on establishing and maintaining an efficient civil service in the Philippines. The order itself doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue it subtly aims to inspire a sense of joy and surprise. Joy, because it facilitates better governance in the Philippines. Surprise, because it highlights the collaboration between the two commissions. The intensity of these emotions is likely to be low, as the order is primarily administrative in nature.",
