    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on official documentation and legal compliance. It lacks strong emotional cues, as its main purpose is to communicate a decision regarding an employee's retirement rather than to evoke specific feelings. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Considering this, I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
