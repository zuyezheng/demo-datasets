A baseline score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions, with slight increases for emotions that might be indirectly related to the content, such as a mild sense of satisfaction (joy) in clarifying the rules or a slight concern (fear) about potential issues if the rules are not followed. However, these are very subtle.",
