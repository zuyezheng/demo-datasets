It's a legal document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is neutral in tone and serves a specific administrative function. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional expression.",
