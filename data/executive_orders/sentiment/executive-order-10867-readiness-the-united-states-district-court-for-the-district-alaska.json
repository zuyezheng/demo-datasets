    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement about the readiness of the United States District Court for the District of Alaska and the termination of the old court. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. A slight sense of joy that the transition is complete and things are in order might be present. There might be a very mild surprise that it is happening now, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
