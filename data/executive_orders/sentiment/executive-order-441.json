    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement granting government employees time off to honor fallen soldiers. It aims to evoke respect and solemn remembrance, aligning with sadness and perhaps a touch of pride or joy in honoring the brave. There's no intention to evoke anger, fear, disgust, or strong surprise. The primary emotion is sadness, reflecting the solemnity of the occasion. A secondary emotion could be joy, representing the honor and respect for the fallen. The intensity of sadness should be moderate, around 6, and joy should be lower, around 3.",
