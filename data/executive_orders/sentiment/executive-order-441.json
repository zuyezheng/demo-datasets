    "critique": "The president is directing that government employees be allowed to attend ceremonies honoring deceased soldiers. This suggests respect and somber remembrance, leaning towards sadness, but also a sense of duty and respect, which tempers strong emotional expression. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or strong surprise. The primary emotion is sadness, but it's subdued and respectful, not overwhelming. The other emotions are negligible.",
