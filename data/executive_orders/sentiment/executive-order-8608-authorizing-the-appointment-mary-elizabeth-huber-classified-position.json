    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order allows Mary Elizabeth Huber to be appointed to a position without following standard civil service rules. This might bring a slight sense of joy to Mary Elizabeth Huber, but for the general audience, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions.",
