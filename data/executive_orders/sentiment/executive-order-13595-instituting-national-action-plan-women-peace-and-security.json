It seeks to convey a sense of hope, determination, and commitment to these goals. Therefore, the primary emotions to be conveyed are joy (related to the positive outcomes) and a sense of reduced fear (related to protection from violence). There might also be a touch of sadness related to the issues addressed. Surprise and disgust are less relevant.",
