    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order outlining policy and responsibilities related to women, peace, and security. It aims to promote women's participation in conflict resolution and protect populations from violence. The language is formal and legalistic, with a focus on policy and implementation. Therefore, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There is a slight sense of hope and determination to address these issues, but it is not strongly emphasized. Given the formal nature, most emotions are scored low.",
