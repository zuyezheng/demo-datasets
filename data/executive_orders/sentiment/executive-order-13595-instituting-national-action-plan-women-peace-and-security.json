    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order outlining a National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security. The language is formal and policy-oriented. The primary emotions conveyed, if any, are related to the importance of the policy and the potential for positive change. There is a sense of hope and determination, but these are not strongly emphasized. The document aims to convey a sense of seriousness and commitment to the stated goals. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust and surprise are not the primary emotions. The initial scores will reflect this assessment.",
