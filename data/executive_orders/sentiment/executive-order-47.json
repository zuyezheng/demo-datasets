    "critique": "The document describes a situation where a clerk was unfairly transferred and later reinstated after an investigation. The language is formal and factual. There's a sense of injustice and eventual resolution. Based on this, I will assign initial scores for sadness (due to the initial injustice), and a slight amount of surprise (due to the unexpected conviction). Other emotions are not strongly conveyed, so I will assign them a low score.",
