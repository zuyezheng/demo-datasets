The order is amending a previous executive order to make a reservation available for use of the Pima and Maricopa Indians and such other Indians as the Secretary of the Interior may see fit to settle thereon. This is a positive change that should bring joy to the Indians and surprise to those who were not expecting it. The intensity of joy should be 7 and the intensity of surprise should be 3.",
