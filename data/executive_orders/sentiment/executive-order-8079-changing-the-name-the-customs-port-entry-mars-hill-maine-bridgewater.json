    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily concerns administrative changes to a customs port of entry. There is no strong emotional content. The changes themselves might bring a slight sense of satisfaction or relief to those affected, but the document itself doesn't convey these emotions directly. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. I will give a slightly higher score to surprise as the change in name and inclusion of townships might be unexpected.",
