The primary emotions the president wants to convey are trust and confidence in the system. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is meant to be taken seriously and to be seen as a step towards a more organized and professional civil service. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low.",
