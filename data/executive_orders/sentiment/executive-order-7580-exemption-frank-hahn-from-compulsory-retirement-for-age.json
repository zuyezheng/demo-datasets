    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of Frank Hahn from compulsory retirement. It primarily conveys a sense of official procedure and adherence to legal requirements. There is minimal emotional content. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not explicitly expressed. A baseline level of formality might imply a slight degree of seriousness, but not enough to warrant a high score for any particular emotion.",
