It should evoke a feeling of fear due to the threats posed by foreign adversaries and a sense of surprise at the extent of data collection and potential risks. It also aims to instill a sense of trust and confidence in the government's actions to address these issues. The order does not aim to evoke joy, sadness, or disgust.",
