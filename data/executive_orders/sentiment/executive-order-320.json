    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement to close government offices for Memorial Day. The primary emotion conveyed is respect and solemn remembrance for fallen soldiers. There might be a touch of sadness associated with the remembrance, but joy, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are not intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with a low sadness score and all other emotions at zero. Upon review, the sadness score could be slightly higher to acknowledge the solemn nature of the event.",
