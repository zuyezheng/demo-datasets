It highlights a dispute that threatens essential transportation services and emphasizes the need for investigation and resolution. The emotions the president wants to convey are concern (leading to sadness) and a sense of urgency (potentially leading to fear that the situation could worsen if not addressed). There might also be a hint of surprise that the dispute has not been resolved yet. There is no indication of joy, disgust, or anger.",
