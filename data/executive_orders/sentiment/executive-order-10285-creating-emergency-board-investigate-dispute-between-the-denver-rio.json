    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The language is legal and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, the document aims to convey a sense of calm and control in the face of a potential disruption, so a slight increase in 'joy' (as in, confidence or stability) might be warranted. All other emotions remain very low.",
