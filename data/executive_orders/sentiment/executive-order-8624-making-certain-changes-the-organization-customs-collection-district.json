    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, unlikely to evoke strong emotions. It revokes the designation of Ajo, Arizona, as a customs port of entry and designates Sonoyta, Arizona, as a customs port of entry. The order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1. After further consideration, the order might evoke a very mild sense of surprise in those familiar with the area, so the surprise score is revised to 2.",
