The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotion conveyed. A score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions except perhaps a slightly elevated sense of concern or seriousness, which might justify a 2 for sadness. However, to maintain consistency with the instruction to default to 1 when information is lacking, I will keep all initial scores at 1.",
