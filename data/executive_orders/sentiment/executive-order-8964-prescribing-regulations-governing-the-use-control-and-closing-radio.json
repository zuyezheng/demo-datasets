    "critique": "The executive order is a serious and formal document issued during a time of war. The primary emotion it aims to convey is a sense of urgency and resolve, with a secondary goal of reassuring the public that measures are being taken to ensure national security. Therefore, fear and surprise should be minimized, while a sense of controlled urgency (perhaps leaning towards sadness given the context of war) should be emphasized. Joy and disgust are not relevant in this context.",
