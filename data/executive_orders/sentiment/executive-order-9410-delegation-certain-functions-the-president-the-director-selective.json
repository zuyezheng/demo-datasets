    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document with the purpose of delegating power and clarifying responsibilities within the Selective Service System during wartime. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, a sense of confidence and perhaps slight relief that the government is handling the war effort effectively might be present. Therefore, I will score it accordingly.",
