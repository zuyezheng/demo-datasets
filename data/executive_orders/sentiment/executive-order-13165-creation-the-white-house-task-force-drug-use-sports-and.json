The order conveys a sense of urgency and determination to combat drug use.The primary emotions the president wants to convey are concern and determination. I will score fear, sadness, and disgust to reflect concern, and joy and surprise as 0, since the document does not intend to convey those emotions. Revised scores will reflect the same.",
