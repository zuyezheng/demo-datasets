    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the tax status of cost-of-living allowances for employees of the Joint Federal-State Land Use Planning Commission for Alaska. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of justification and resolution of an inequity. There's a mild sense of rectifying a wrong, but it's very subdued. There isn't strong emotion here. The document aims to be objective and factual.",
