    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the tax status of cost-of-living allowances for employees of the Joint Federal-State Land Use Planning Commission for Alaska. The language is legal and bureaucratic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional expression. There is no indication of an attempt to convey joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to rectify a perceived inequity in tax treatment. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
