    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of Joe Smith from mandatory retirement. It expresses no strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the President is able to use his authority to help Joe Smith continue his service, but this is very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
