    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding promotion limitations and disability separation practices in the armed forces. It is a formal and legal document. Therefore, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The most relevant emotions would be related to the impact of the order on military personnel, but the document itself is neutral. Initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions, as the document does not explicitly express any of them. After further consideration, the document is purely informational and legal, thus no emotions are intended to be conveyed. The revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
