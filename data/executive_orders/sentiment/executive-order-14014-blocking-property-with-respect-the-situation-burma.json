    "critique": "The document expresses concern and condemnation regarding the coup in Burma. It aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination to address the situation. The primary emotions conveyed are anger and disgust towards the actions of the Burmese military, as well as a sense of concern and perhaps sadness for the people of Burma. There might be a hint of surprise at the unexpectedness of the coup, but this is less prominent. The document does not express joy or fear. The scores are based on the assumption that the American public would feel similarly.",
