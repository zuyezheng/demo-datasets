It aims to convey the seriousness of the situation and the US's resolve to address it through sanctions and other measures. There is sadness about the events in Burma, fear about the implications for national security, and disgust at the actions of the military. Surprise is low, as the document is a formal response to a known event. Joy is absent.",
