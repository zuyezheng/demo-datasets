    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Peace Corps. The language is legal and official. There is a sense of optimism and hope for international cooperation, but it is presented in a very formal and measured way. Therefore, joy and surprise should be relatively low. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust. The document primarily conveys a sense of purpose and determination, which can be interpreted as a low level of joy.",
