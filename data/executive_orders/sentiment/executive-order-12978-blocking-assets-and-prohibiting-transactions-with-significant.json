    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing a threat. It should evoke fear in those involved in narcotics trafficking and a sense of security and confidence in the government's actions for the general public. There might be a slight element of surprise at the declaration of a national emergency, but overall, the dominant emotions are fear and a controlled sense of determination (which I'll map to a low level of joy that the situation is being handled). Disgust is also relevant as the order is in response to narcotics trafficking.",
