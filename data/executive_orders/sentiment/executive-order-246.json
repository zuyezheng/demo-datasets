    "critique": "The president wants to convey a sense of seriousness and determination to enforce the law. The primary emotions to convey are a lack of joy, a touch of sadness about the situation, and a strong sense of disapproval or disgust towards the lawless behavior. There should also be an element of surprise that such resistance is occurring, and a degree of fear instilled in those who are resisting the law. The intensity should reflect the gravity of the situation and the president's resolve.",
