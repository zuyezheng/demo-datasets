The language is formal and policy-oriented, aiming to inspire confidence and action. There's an underlying tone of joy in promoting equal opportunity and national progress, but also a sense of responsibility and seriousness in addressing the challenges faced by HBCUs. There is no indication of negative emotions such as fear, disgust, or sadness. Surprise is not a prominent emotion in this context.",
