    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of preparedness and global cooperation in the face of infectious disease threats. It seeks to instill confidence and a sense of security through coordinated efforts and strategic planning. The order also highlights the importance of international collaboration and adherence to established protocols, such as the International Health Regulations (IHR). Therefore, the primary emotions the president wants to convey are joy and surprise. Joy because the order is meant to make people feel safe and surprise because the order is implementing new policies.",
