The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of controlled and deliberate action. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on procedures and authorizations. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
