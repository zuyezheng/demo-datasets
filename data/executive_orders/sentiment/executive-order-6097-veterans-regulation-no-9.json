    "critique": "The executive order is about providing burial expenses for deceased war veterans. The primary emotion the president likely wants to convey is a sense of solemnity and respect for the veterans. There might also be a subtle element of relief or gratitude for the beneficiaries. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear or disgust. Surprise is not the primary goal, but the beneficiaries might feel surprised by the help.",
