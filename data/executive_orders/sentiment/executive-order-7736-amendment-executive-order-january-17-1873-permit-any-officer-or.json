    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily concerns legal and administrative matters, specifically amending a previous order to allow certain officers and employees in the Virgin Islands to hold a position as Immigration Inspector. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and objective, focusing on the legal and practical aspects of the amendment. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of any strong emotional tone. Considering it is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for each emotion to acknowledge the possibility of subtle undertones or implications.",
