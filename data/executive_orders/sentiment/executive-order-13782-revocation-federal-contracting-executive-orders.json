    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily deals with legal and administrative matters, specifically the revocation of previous executive orders and the reconsideration of related rules. The language is formal and legalistic, lacking emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal across all emotions. I will assign low scores for all emotions, with a slight bump for surprise due to the nature of executive orders potentially bringing unexpected changes.",
