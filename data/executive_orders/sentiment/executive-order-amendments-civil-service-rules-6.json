    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical amendment related to the certification of Indian graduates from specific normal classes and schools. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue it aims to inspire a mild sense of joy and surprise by streamlining the certification process for Indian graduates, and reducing the burden of examination. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
