It revokes previous orders deemed not in the public interest and directs agencies to implement the changes. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of positive change and perhaps a mild sense of surprise that these orders are being revoked. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, fear, or disgust.",
