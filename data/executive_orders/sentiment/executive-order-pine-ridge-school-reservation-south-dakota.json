    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Pine Ridge Sioux Indian Reservation. It uses formal and legal language. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the nature of the document, the intensity of any emotion conveyed is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I will assign a low score (1) for each emotion to reflect the lack of emotional expression.",
