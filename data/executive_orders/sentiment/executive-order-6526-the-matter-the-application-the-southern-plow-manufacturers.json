    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of resolution and fairness. While it denies an exemption, it also addresses a concern about restrictive wording. There's no strong push for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order and impartiality. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across all emotions. The revised scores remain low, but with a slight increase in surprise to acknowledge the change in wording.",
