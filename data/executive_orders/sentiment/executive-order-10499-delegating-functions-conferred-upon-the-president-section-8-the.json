    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily concerns the delegation of authority regarding the Uniformed Services Contingency Option Act of 1953. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After a second thought, the document does not convey any specific emotion, so I will keep the scores low.",
