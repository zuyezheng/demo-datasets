    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Funeral Supply Industry. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and formality, not any strong emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After a second thought, the document does not convey any specific emotion, so I will keep the scores low.",
