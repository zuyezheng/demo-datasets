    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on regulatory reform. It aims to improve the regulatory system for the American people. The language is formal and objective, with a focus on efficiency, coordination, and consistency. There is a slight sense of dissatisfaction with the current regulatory system, but this is presented in a neutral tone. There is no strong expression of any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
