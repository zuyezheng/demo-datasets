    "critique": "The document expresses a desire for a more efficient and effective regulatory system. The President aims to convey a sense of optimism and determination to improve the regulatory process for the benefit of the American people. There is a hint of dissatisfaction with the current system, but the overall tone is forward-looking and constructive. The document does not explicitly express strong emotions like anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not a primary emotion conveyed, but there might be a subtle element of it in the sense of introducing significant changes. Joy is present in the sense of the positive outcomes expected from the changes. Sadness is present in the sense of the current system not working.",
