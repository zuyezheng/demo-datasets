    "critique": "The document is a series of amendments to the Code of Fair Competition for the Petroleum Industry. It is primarily concerned with regulations, production quotas, pricing, and labor conditions within the petroleum industry. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotional sentiment conveyed by the document. The president is trying to convey a sense of order and control. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
