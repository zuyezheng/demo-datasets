    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document related to civil service rules and procedures. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The primary goal appears to be to communicate a change in regulations regarding the promotion of unclassified laborers within specific departments. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low, as the order is not intended to elicit a strong emotional response. The order seems to be a formal announcement with little emotional content. It is unlikely to evoke strong feelings of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
