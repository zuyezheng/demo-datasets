It discusses promotions of unclassified laborers to classified positions within the Ordnance Department and Chemical Warfare Service. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary purpose is to announce and explain a change in civil service regulations. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content.",
