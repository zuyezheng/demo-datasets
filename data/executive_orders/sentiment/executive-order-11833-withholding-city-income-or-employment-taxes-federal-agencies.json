    "critique": "The executive order is a technical document that aims to establish regulations for withholding city income or employment taxes from the compensation of federal employees. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The order is informational and procedural, not designed to evoke feelings of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
