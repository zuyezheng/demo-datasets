    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of control and necessity during an emergency. It's unlikely to evoke joy or surprise. There might be a sense of fear or disgust among those negatively affected by the order (e.g., striking workers), but the primary goal isn't to instill those emotions. Instead, it seems to aim for a sense of seriousness and perhaps a bit of sadness that such measures are necessary.",
