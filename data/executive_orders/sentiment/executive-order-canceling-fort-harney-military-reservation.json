    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation. It cancels a previous order and reassigns the land to an Indian Reservation. There is no explicit emotional language used. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions due to the lack of emotional content. Upon review, the initial assessment remains accurate as the document is purely administrative and lacks any emotional cues.",
