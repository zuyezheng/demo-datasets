    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, reassigning land from a military reservation to an Indian reservation. It's unlikely the president intended to evoke strong emotions. However, depending on one's perspective, there might be a slight sense of surprise or perhaps sadness (if one was attached to the Fort Harney military reservation). There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, or disgust.",
