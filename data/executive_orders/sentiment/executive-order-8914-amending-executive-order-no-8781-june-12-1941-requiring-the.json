    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amendment. It discusses civil service regulations and employee fingerprinting. The language is legal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotions would be related to potential concerns about privacy (fear, disgust) or relief from requirements (joy, surprise), but the overall tone is neutral. Initial scores will be low across the board. Revised scores will reflect a slight increase in surprise and fear due to the nature of the order.",
