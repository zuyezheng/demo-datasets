    "critique": "The document primarily focuses on establishing ethical guidelines and standards of conduct for the Postal Rate Commission. It emphasizes impartiality, public confidence, and prevention of conflicts of interest. There's no strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is formal and legalistic, aiming to ensure integrity and transparency. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be relatively low.",
