    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding emergency preparedness for domestic surface transportation. It outlines responsibilities and functions of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is a sense of urgency and seriousness due to the nature of emergency planning, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. The document focuses on preparedness and coordination in the face of potential threats. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this with low levels of most emotions and a slightly elevated sense of fear and surprise due to the emergency context.",
