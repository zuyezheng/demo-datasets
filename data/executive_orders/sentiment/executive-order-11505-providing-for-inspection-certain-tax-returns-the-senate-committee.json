    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal and legal document. It grants the Senate Committee on the Judiciary the authority to inspect tax returns for specific years as part of their investigation into internal security laws. The language is very formal and procedural. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The most likely emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such an order is being issued, but even that is unlikely to be strong.",
