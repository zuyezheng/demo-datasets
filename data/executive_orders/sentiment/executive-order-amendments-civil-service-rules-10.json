    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document detailing changes to departmental rules. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most likely emotion might be a mild surprise that such a document exists, but even that is a stretch. The initial scores are set to reflect this, with surprise being the only emotion with a non-zero score. After further consideration, even surprise seems unlikely, as the document is purely procedural and not intended to elicit any emotional response. Therefore, all scores are revised to zero.",
