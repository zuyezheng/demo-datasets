    "critique": "The document is a formal order to close Executive Departments for the funeral of ex-President Grant. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death of a former president. There might be a slight sense of respect and solemnity, but joy, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are not evident. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with sadness being the most prominent emotion. The revised scores maintain the emphasis on sadness while slightly adjusting the other emotions to reflect the formal and respectful tone.",
