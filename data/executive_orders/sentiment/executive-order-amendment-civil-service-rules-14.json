    "critique": "The executive order is a simple amendment to an existing rule, allowing for the hiring of kindergarten teachers without examination. It's a routine administrative action with minimal emotional impact. There's no inherent reason for the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The action is likely intended to facilitate the education of children, but the order itself is emotionally neutral.",
