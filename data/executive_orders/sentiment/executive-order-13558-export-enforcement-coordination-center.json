    "critique": "The executive order aims to instill a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect national interests. It emphasizes coordination and enforcement, which should ideally reduce fear and promote a sense of stability. There's no intention to evoke joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotions targeted are a reduction in fear and a subtle increase in confidence or perhaps a feeling of security, which I will represent as a low level of joy.",
