The language is legal and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of joy or satisfaction that natural resources are being protected, but the overall emotional intensity is low. Therefore, initial scores will be low across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy. After reflection, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low, with a slight adjustment to joy.",
