    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order pertains to the appointment of an individual to a specific position, and it is unlikely to generate widespread joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such a specific action requires an executive order, but even that is a stretch.",
