    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending restrictions on land alienation for Native Americans. It uses legal and bureaucratic language. There is no explicit expression of emotion. The context suggests potential sadness or anger from the Native Americans whose land rights are being restricted, but the document itself doesn't convey these emotions. The president is not attempting to portray any particular emotion. Therefore, a score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions.",
