    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of concern and responsibility in response to the Three Mile Island accident. While it doesn't explicitly express emotions, the actions taken suggest an underlying fear and a need to address public concerns. The establishment of a commission, the focus on investigation, and the emphasis on public information all point to these emotions. The scores are assigned based on this interpretation, with fear and sadness being the most prominent, followed by surprise and disgust, and finally joy.",
