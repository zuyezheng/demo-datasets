    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document addressing a labor dispute. It aims to convey a sense of authority, responsibility, and impartiality. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to ensure the continuation of essential transportation services by resolving the dispute through a board of investigation. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
