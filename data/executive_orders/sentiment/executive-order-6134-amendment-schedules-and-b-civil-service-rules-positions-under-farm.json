    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to civil service rules. It concerns the transfer of positions and personnel to the Farm Credit Administration. The language is formal and administrative. There is no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. I will set the initial scores to 1 for all emotions, indicating a minimal presence. After further consideration, I still believe that the document does not convey any strong emotions. The revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
