    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the security of the Canal Zone. It outlines the responsibilities and authority of the Commander in Chief, Caribbean, and the Governor of the Canal Zone, particularly in times of emergency. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the context of ensuring security during an emergency might implicitly convey a sense of concern or seriousness. Given the formal and unemotional tone, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal. Therefore, initial scores for all emotions are set to 1.",
