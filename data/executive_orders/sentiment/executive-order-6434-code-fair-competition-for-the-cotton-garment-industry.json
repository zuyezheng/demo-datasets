It addresses fair competition, labor conditions, and economic stability within the Cotton Garment Industry. The order does not seem to want the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Instead, it aims to instill confidence and assurance in the government's ability to manage the economy and protect workers' rights. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low.",
