It primarily deals with the transfer of functions, powers, and duties related to volunteer programs from the ACTION Agency to the Small Business Administration. The language is legal and administrative, devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Since there isn't enough information to suggest any strong emotion, a score of 1 is appropriate for each.",
