    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, fairness, and competence in the diplomatic service. It emphasizes efficiency, merit-based promotions, and standardized examinations. Therefore, the primary emotion it seeks to evoke is a sense of trust and confidence in the system. There might be a secondary goal of inspiring a sense of ambition and motivation among those seeking to join or advance within the diplomatic service, but this is less pronounced. It does not seem to want to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a primary goal, although the detailed nature of the order might create a mild sense of it.",
