    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical correction related to land allocation for the Turtle Mountain band of Chippewa Indians. It's unlikely that the president intends to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The primary goal is to communicate a legal and administrative change. However, there might be a slight element of relief or satisfaction for those interested in the well-being of the Turtle Mountain band, and perhaps a touch of disappointment for those who might have been interested in settling the land. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and sadness and very low scores to the other emotions.",
