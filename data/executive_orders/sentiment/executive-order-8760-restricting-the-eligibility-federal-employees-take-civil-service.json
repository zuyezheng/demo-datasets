    "critique": "The document is a presidential order regarding civil service examinations during an emergency. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the context of an 'emergency' might evoke a sense of fear or concern. The order aims to control the movement of personnel within the government, which could be interpreted as a sign of worry or a need for stability. However, without knowing the specifics of the emergency, it's difficult to gauge the intensity of any emotion. The order could also be interpreted as a display of authority and control, minimizing any strong emotional response. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on fear and surprise due to the mention of an 'emergency'.",
