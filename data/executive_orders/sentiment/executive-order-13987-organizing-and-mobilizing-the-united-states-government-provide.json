    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of urgency and determination to combat the virus. There's also an element of hope for a better future through coordinated efforts. However, there is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and official, aiming to establish a clear plan of action. Therefore, the scores for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust and surprise should be relatively low, reflecting the absence of strong emotional appeals.",
