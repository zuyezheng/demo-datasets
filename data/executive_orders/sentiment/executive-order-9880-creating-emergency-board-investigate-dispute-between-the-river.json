    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the establishment of a board to investigate a dispute. It doesn't explicitly try to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a very slight sense of reassurance or relief might be present, suggesting that the situation is being handled. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the rest. After further consideration, the order is very procedural and unlikely to evoke any emotions. The initial assessment of slight reassurance is not accurate.",
