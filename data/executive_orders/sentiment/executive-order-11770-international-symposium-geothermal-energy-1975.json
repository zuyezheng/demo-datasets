    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the International Symposium on Geothermal Energy. It primarily concerns authorization and delegation of responsibilities to the Secretary of the Interior. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on the efficient administration of the symposium. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
