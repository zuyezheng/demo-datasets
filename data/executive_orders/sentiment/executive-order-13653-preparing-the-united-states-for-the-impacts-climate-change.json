    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing climate change preparedness and resilience. It outlines policies, responsibilities, and actions for federal agencies. The primary emotion conveyed is concern about the impacts of climate change and a sense of urgency to address them. There is also an element of hope that coordinated action can mitigate these impacts. Given the formal nature, strong emotions are unlikely. Therefore, I will assign initial scores based on these considerations.",
