    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a technical amendment related to employee allowances at Johnston Island. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is dated 1992, so it is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions today. The most relevant emotion might be surprise, but at a very low level, as it is unexpected to read about such a specific and old order.",
