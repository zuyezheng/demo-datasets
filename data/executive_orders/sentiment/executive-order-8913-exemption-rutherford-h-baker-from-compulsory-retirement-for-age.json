    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to exempt Rutherford H. Baker from compulsory retirement. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the document conveys a sense of duty and perhaps a slight sense of kindness or consideration for Mr. Baker's service. I will assign low scores to joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise, and a slightly higher score to joy to reflect the positive aspect of the exemption.",
