    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding appointments within the Bureau of Water Carriers of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The language is legalistic and administrative. There is no explicit expression of emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions. The recommendation by the Interstate Commerce Commission suggests a degree of approval or satisfaction, but this is not strongly conveyed. The revised scores will reflect the lack of emotional content, with a slight increase in joy to reflect the positive recommendation.",
