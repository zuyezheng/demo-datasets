    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration establishing a wildlife refuge. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and purpose, with a hint of care for wildlife. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legal and administrative, not emotional. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive action of creating a refuge.",
