    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a purely administrative action, with the postponement of a transfer. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotions might be a mild surprise (if someone was expecting the transfer to happen sooner) or perhaps slight disappointment (if someone wanted the transfer to happen sooner). However, these would be very mild. I will set the initial scores to surprise: 2, and all other emotions to 1. Then, upon reflection, I will revise all scores to 1, indicating a neutral emotional impact.",
