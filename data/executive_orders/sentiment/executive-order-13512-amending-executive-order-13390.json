    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order. It extends the work of the Coordinator of Federal Support for the Recovery and Rebuilding of the Gulf Coast Region. There is no explicit emotion conveyed in the document. However, the extension of support could be interpreted as a sign of continued commitment and hope, but this is very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive implication of continued support.",
