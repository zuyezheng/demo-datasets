The language is legalistic and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, devoid of emotional expression. There's no indication of the President attempting to convey joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default score of 1 due to the lack of emotional content.",
