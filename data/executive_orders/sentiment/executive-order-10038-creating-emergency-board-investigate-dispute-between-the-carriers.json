    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The language is legalistic and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the situation implies a potential for negative consequences (disruption of interstate commerce), which might evoke some level of concern or unease. Therefore, I will assign low scores for fear and sadness, and a minimal score for surprise. Joy and disgust are not relevant in this context.The initial scores reflect the subtle emotions potentially evoked by the document's content.",
