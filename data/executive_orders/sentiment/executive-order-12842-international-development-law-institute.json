    "critique": "The executive order is a formal designation of the International Development Law Institute as a public international organization. It invokes legal authorities and clarifies that the designation does not diminish any existing privileges. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire for the audience to feel confidence and perhaps a mild sense of approval or agreement. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate a legal decision and its implications. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be very low.",
