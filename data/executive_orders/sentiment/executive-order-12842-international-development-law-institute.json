    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the International Development Law Institute as a public international organization. It invokes the authority of the President and cites specific laws. The language is legal and official, with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions set to 1. After further consideration, there's no reason to adjust these scores, as the document remains devoid of emotional expression.",
