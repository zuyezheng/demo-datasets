    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of hope and determination to address systemic inequalities in education for Black Americans. It acknowledges past injustices and present disparities, but emphasizes progress and the potential for further advancement. Therefore, the primary emotions to convey are joy (related to progress and opportunity) and a tempered sadness (related to the acknowledgement of past and present inequalities). There might also be a slight element of surprise related to the depth of the issues, but this is less prominent. There is no intention to convey anger, fear, or disgust.",
