    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land withdrawal in Wyoming. It's a legal and administrative document, so it doesn't express strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of formality or seriousness, but overall, the emotional intensity is low. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions initially. Then upon further consideration, I will reduce the surprise score from 2 to 1, as there is no element of surprise in such a document.",
