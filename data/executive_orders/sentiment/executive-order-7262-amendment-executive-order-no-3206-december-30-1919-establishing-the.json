    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily aims to coordinate government agencies involved in surveying and map-making. The language is neutral and objective, focusing on establishing a board and defining its responsibilities. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is purely administrative in nature. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content.",
