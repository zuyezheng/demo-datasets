    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order. The language is very formal and specific, and the content is an update to existing policy. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of joy that malaria is being addressed, but this would be very mild. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board.",
