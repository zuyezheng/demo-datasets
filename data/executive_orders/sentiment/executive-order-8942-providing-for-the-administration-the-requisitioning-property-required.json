    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of serious authority and decisive action. It's about mobilizing resources for defense, so it might evoke a sense of urgency and perhaps a little fear or concern, but not overwhelmingly. There's no intent to evoke joy or sadness. Disgust is irrelevant. Surprise might be a minor factor, as people learn about the extent of the President's powers.",
