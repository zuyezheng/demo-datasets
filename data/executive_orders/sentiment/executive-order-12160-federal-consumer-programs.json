    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Consumer Affairs Council and outlining its functions and responsibilities. The primary goal is to improve the management, coordination, and effectiveness of federal consumer programs. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on establishing structures, procedures, and responsibilities. There is a very slight sense of joy from the idea of helping consumers, but it is minimal. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
