    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, control, and perhaps cautious optimism regarding the regulation of alcohol. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to establish an administrative framework, suggesting a focus on stability and governance rather than emotional impact. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
