The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The public is not expected to feel any strong emotion based on this document. Therefore, the initial scores should be low for all emotions.",
