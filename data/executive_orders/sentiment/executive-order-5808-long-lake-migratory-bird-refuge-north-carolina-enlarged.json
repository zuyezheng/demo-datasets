    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to establish a bird and wild animal refuge. The intended emotions are likely joy (for conservationists and those who value nature), and potentially fear/disgust towards those who might violate the rules and face penalties. There might be a tinge of sadness for the initial state of the area before it was protected. Surprise is unlikely to be a significant emotion evoked by this order.",
