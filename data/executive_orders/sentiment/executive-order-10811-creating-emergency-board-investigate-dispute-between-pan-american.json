    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding a labor dispute. It invokes the Railway Labor Act and establishes a board to investigate the dispute. The language is legalistic and neutral in tone. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the implicit concern about the disruption of interstate commerce suggests a mild level of concern or perhaps a desire to avoid negative consequences. Therefore, I will assign low scores to sadness and fear, and a score of 1 to the other emotions.",
