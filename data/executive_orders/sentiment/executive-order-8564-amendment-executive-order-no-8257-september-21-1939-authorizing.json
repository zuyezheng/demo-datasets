    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a purely administrative document. It modifies a previous order to allow for excepted appointments related to the national defense program. The language is formal and legalistic, and the purpose is to ensure efficient staffing during a time of national need. There is no explicit attempt to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. However, one could argue that the order might induce a sense of reassurance or confidence (a mild form of joy) that the government is taking steps to address potential staffing shortages during a critical time. It could also cause a bit of fear in the sense that the order is related to national defense, which is often associated with potential threats or conflict. Surprise and disgust are unlikely. Sadness is also unlikely, unless the reader is negatively affected by the change in civil service rules. Anger is also unlikely, unless the reader is negatively affected by the change in civil service rules. Therefore, the initial scores are joy: 2, fear: 2, surprise: 1, disgust: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1. Upon further reflection, the primary goal of the document is informational and administrative. Any emotional response is likely to be very mild and indirect. The order itself doesn't aim to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, I will revise the scores to be even lower.",
