    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order to include the Department of the Interior in certain committees. The language is very formal and factual. There is no intention to evoke any strong emotions in the reader. The most likely emotion to be conveyed is perhaps a mild sense of surprise that such a specific amendment is being made, but even that is very mild. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions.",
