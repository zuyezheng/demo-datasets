    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the closure of government offices and leave for employees to attend events related to the unveiling of a statue for the late President Garfield. The primary emotion conveyed is respect and remembrance, with a touch of solemnity given the occasion. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, but the context implies a degree of sadness due to the remembrance of a deceased president. The other emotions are not strongly present, so they are scored low.",
