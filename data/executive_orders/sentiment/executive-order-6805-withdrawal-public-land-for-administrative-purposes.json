    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It withdraws land for use by the Department of Agriculture. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion the president wants to convey. A slight sense of reassurance that the government is functioning and managing resources responsibly might be present, but it's very mild. Therefore, I will score joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all as 1 initially.",
