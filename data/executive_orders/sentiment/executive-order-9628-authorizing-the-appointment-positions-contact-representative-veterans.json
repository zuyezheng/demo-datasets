The order is to allow veterans who have been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor to be appointed to the classified position of Contact Representative in the Veterans Administration without compliance with the requirements of the Civil Service Rules. This is a positive thing for veterans, so the audience should feel joy. The audience may also feel surprise that this is allowed.",
