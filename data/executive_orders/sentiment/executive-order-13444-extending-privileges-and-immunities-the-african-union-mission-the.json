    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration extending privileges and immunities to the African Union Mission. It uses formal language and aims to convey a sense of officialdom and legal compliance. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is primarily informational and procedural. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of strong emotional signals. After a second thought, I still believe that the document does not express any strong emotions, so the scores should remain low.",
