    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It extends privileges and immunities to the African Union Mission, but it doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. The order is formal and legalistic in tone. Therefore, I would expect low scores across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily informational, there might be a slight element of 'surprise' intended, as the reader might not have been expecting this particular extension of privileges. However, this is a very mild effect.",
