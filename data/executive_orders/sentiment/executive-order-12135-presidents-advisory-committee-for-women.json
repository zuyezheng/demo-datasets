    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing and defining the functions of the President's Advisory Committee for Women. The language is legal and administrative, with a focus on outlining responsibilities, authorities, and timelines. There is little to no emotional expression in such a document. Therefore, most emotions should be scored very low. There might be a slight sense of joy or hope associated with the promotion of equality for women, but it's very subtle and should be reflected in a low score.",
