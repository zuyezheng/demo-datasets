    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Hualpai Indians. It primarily uses neutral and legal language. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to be objective and authoritative. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional content. Considering the formal nature of the document, a baseline of 1 is appropriate for emotions not explicitly conveyed.",
