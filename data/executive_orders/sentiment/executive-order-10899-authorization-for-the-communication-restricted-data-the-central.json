    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of importance and authority, but not necessarily to evoke strong emotions. It's more about conveying a legal and official directive. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values. After further consideration, I realized that the order might instill a sense of surprise due to the involvement of the CIA in atomic energy matters, so I've adjusted the surprise score slightly upwards.",
