    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of official action and policy implementation rather than any strong emotion. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on authorization and direction. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the initial assessment remains accurate due to the document's formal and unemotional nature.",
