    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and reassurance. It's a formal document addressing a specific personnel matter, so strong emotions are unlikely. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not the primary emotions the order intends to evoke. However, there might be a slight sense of reassurance (low joy) that the government is functioning and addressing personnel matters appropriately. The initial scores are set to reflect this, with a very low joy score and the rest at zero. After further consideration, I believe the order is purely administrative and does not aim to evoke any specific emotion. Therefore, all scores should be zero.",
