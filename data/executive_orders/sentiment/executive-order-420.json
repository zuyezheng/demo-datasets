    "critique": "The document is a military order to release prisoners. It does not express any particular emotion. The president is likely trying to convey a sense of justice or mercy, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I will score all emotions as 1 initially, as there isn't enough information to suggest a stronger emotion. After further consideration, the act of releasing prisoners, especially during wartime, might evoke a slight sense of surprise or joy in some, but I'll keep the scores low as the document is primarily a formal order.",
