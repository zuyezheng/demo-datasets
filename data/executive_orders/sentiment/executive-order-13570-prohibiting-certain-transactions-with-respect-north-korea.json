    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding North Korea. It primarily conveys a sense of seriousness and determination to address a national emergency. There is a hint of concern (fear) regarding the situation with North Korea, but overall, the document is quite neutral in tone. Therefore, joy, sadness, disgust, and surprise should be minimal. The scores are on a scale of 1-10.",
