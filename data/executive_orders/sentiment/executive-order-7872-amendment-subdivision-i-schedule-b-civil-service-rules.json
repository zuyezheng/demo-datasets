    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, administrative document. It amends a subdivision of the Civil Service Rules related to housing projects. There's no obvious attempt to evoke strong emotions. The order seems to be a matter of procedure and efficiency. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a tiny sense of relief or satisfaction in those who manage federal low-rent housing projects, so I will adjust the joy score slightly.",
