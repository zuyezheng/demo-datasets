    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish a career executive service within the federal government. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of purpose and importance might be present. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive intent of improving the civil service.",
