    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement of respect for Mrs. Anna Eleanor Roosevelt. The primary emotion conveyed should be sadness, with a score of 7 to reflect the somber nature of flying the flag at half-staff. There might be a touch of surprise at the announcement, but it's minimal, so I'll score it at 2. There is no joy, anger, fear, or disgust.",
