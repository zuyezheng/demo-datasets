    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily aims to transfer and establish the Federal Fire Council within the Department of Commerce and outlines its responsibilities and authorities. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the emotion scores should be very low, with a baseline of 1 for each emotion due to the presence of formal language.",
