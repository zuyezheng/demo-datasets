The order is a temporary measure to ensure fair competition within the Underwear and Allied Products Industry until a more permanent code is established. Therefore, the most relevant emotion would be a mild sense of joy that the industry is being regulated. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
