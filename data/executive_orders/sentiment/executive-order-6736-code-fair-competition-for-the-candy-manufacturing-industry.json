It's about implementing a code of fair competition, which should ideally bring a sense of joy and relief. However, there are also elements of caution and potential disappointment if the code doesn't work as intended. The order also conveys a sense of surprise as some rules are stayed. Disgust, fear, and sadness are not really conveyed.",
