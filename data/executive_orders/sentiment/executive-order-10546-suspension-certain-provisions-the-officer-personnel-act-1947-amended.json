    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that suspends certain provisions of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is specific to officers of the Marine Corps and their eligibility for temporary promotion. The most likely emotion to be conveyed is surprise, as the order supersedes a previous executive order. However, the intensity of this emotion is likely to be low.",
