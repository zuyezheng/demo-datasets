There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the formal and administrative nature, the intensity of each emotion is likely to be very low. Therefore, I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion to reflect the lack of emotional content.",
