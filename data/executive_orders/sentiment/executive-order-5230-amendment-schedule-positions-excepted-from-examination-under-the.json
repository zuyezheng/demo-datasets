    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about an amendment to Schedule A, adding a new subdivision for the Federal Farm Board. It specifies the provision of a private secretary or confidential clerk to each member. The language is neutral and factual, without any explicit emotional expression. Given the nature of the document, it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. Therefore, all emotions are scored low, with a default score of 1 due to the lack of emotional content.",
