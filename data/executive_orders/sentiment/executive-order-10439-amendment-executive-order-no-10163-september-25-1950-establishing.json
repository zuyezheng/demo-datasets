    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order regarding the Armed Forces Reserve Medal. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no strong emotional content. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or pride in military service, but this is very subdued. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy to reflect the positive nature of recognizing military service.",
