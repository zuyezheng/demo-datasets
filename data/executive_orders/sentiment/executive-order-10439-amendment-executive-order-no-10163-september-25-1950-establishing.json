    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order regarding the Armed Forces Reserve Medal. The language is very technical and specific, focusing on the criteria for awarding the medal. There is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. The order is purely administrative in nature. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
