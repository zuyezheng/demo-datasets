    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order outlining the responsibilities of the Attorney General in preparing for national emergencies. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of seriousness and urgency due to the nature of the topic, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. The document focuses on preparedness and legal procedures, not emotional appeals. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight increase in fear and surprise due to the context of national emergencies.",
