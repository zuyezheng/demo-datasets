    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the responsibilities of the Attorney General in preparing for national emergencies. The language is formal and legalistic. The order aims to instill a sense of preparedness and security, but also implicitly acknowledges potential threats. Therefore, it should convey a sense of seriousness and perhaps a touch of concern, but not outright fear or panic. Joy is completely inappropriate. Disgust is irrelevant. Surprise is not the primary goal, but a slight sense of awareness of potential unexpected events is present.",
