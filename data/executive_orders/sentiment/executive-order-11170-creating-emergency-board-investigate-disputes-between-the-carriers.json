    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document addressing a labor dispute. It aims to convey a sense of authority, responsibility, and impartiality. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to ensure the continuation of essential transportation services by creating a board to investigate the disputes and prevent disruptions to interstate commerce. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
