    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order issued by President Lyndon B. Johnson. It establishes a board to investigate disputes between railway carriers and their employees. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the context suggests a sense of urgency and concern for maintaining essential transportation services, which could imply a degree of worry or perhaps a desire to project an image of calm and control in the face of a potential crisis. The scores are based on the assumption that the public would perceive a low level of worry and a moderate level of calm/control.",
