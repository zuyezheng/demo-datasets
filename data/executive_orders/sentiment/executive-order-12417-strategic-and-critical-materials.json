    "critique": "The executive order is a technical document that amends a previous executive order. It delegates certain functions to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the audience. However, it may convey a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to manage emergencies. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and very low scores to the other emotions.",
