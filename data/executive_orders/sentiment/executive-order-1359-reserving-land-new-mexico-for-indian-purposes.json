    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land allocation for Indian purposes. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise or perhaps a neutral stance. There's no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for surprise due to the nature of an executive order.",
