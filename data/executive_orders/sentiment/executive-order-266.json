    "critique": "The document expresses sadness and respect for the death of Winfield Scott Hancock. The language used is formal and somber, befitting the occasion. The order to display the flag at half-mast further emphasizes the sadness and mourning. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is likely to be moderate, as it is a formal announcement rather than a personal expression of grief. The other emotions are scored as 1 due to lack of information.",
