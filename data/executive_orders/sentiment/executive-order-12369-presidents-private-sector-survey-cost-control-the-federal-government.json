    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a committee to study cost control in the Federal Government. It is devoid of strong emotional expression, focusing instead on establishing the committee's structure, functions, and administrative details. Therefore, most emotions are scored low. There might be a slight sense of optimism or hope (joy) that the committee will improve efficiency and reduce costs, but it's very subtle. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
