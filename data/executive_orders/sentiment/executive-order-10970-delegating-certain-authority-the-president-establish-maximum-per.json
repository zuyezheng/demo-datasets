    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding travel expenses. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The language is legal and administrative, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating minimal emotional impact. After further consideration, the formal and procedural nature of the document reinforces the lack of emotional content. The revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
