    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding national security emergency preparedness. The primary emotion it aims to convey is a sense of reassurance and preparedness, but also a degree of seriousness given the subject matter. It's not intended to evoke strong emotions like joy or disgust, but rather a sense of calm readiness and confidence in the government's ability to handle emergencies. Therefore, I will score fear and surprise moderately, and other emotions low.",
