    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of urgency and importance regarding national defense. It highlights the need to modernize air-navigation facilities quickly and efficiently. The emotions that the president wants to evoke in the audience are likely fear (related to national security) and surprise (related to the extraordinary measures being taken). There might also be a sense of joy that the problem is being addressed. Disgust and sadness are not really relevant here. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
