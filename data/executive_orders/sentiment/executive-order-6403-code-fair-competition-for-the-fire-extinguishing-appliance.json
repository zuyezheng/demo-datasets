    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Fire Extinguishing Appliance Manufacturing Industry. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and compliance with the law. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal. I will assign low scores across all emotions initially, and then revise based on the context that the document is formal and legal, so there is no room for emotions.",
