    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of formal approval and implementation of regulations. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order and compliance with legal requirements. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, the order might evoke a very mild sense of surprise that the government is taking action, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
