It primarily conveys a sense of authority and security, with a hint of potential fear or concern that necessitates such a defensive measure. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise. The scores are assigned based on this interpretation, with higher values for emotions related to security and concern, and lower values for those that are not relevant.",
