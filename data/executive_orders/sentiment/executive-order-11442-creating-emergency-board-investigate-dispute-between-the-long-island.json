    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and resolution, rather than strong emotions. It acknowledges a dispute and establishes a board to investigate, suggesting a desire to resolve the issue peacefully and efficiently. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. My initial scores are: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 3, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Upon further reflection, the order does carry a slight sense of urgency due to the potential disruption of essential transportation. This might evoke a bit more fear or concern. I will adjust the fear score slightly upward.",
