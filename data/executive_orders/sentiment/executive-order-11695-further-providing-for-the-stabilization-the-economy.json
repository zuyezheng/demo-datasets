    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining economic policies. The primary goal is to convey a sense of stability, control, and confidence in the government's ability to manage the economy. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are joy (related to economic improvement) and a lack of fear, disgust, sadness, and surprise. The intensity should be moderate to avoid appearing overly emotional or manipulative.",
