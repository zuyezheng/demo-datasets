    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding economic stabilization. It aims to continue efforts to reduce inflation and unemployment. The language is formal and legalistic, with a focus on establishing and continuing committees and delegating authority. There is a sense of determination to stabilize the economy, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on determination and perhaps a hint of concern about the economy.",
