    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that withdraws land from settlement for classification and potential addition to Zion National Park. The language is formal and factual, and the purpose is administrative. Therefore, the order is not designed to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. The initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon review, I confirm that the executive order aims to be neutral and objective, so the emotion scores should remain low.",
