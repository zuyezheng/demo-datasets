    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine personnel announcement. It highlights Mr. Harrison's qualifications and the value he brings to the Navy. There's no indication of an intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is professional and informative. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
