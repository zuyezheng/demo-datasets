The language is legalistic and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, with a focus on the conditions of their release. There is a sense of authority and control, but no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of surprise that these individuals are being released, but it's minimal. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
