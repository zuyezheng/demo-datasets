    "critique": "The executive order primarily concerns land management and access, specifically opening up certain lands to homesteading and desert land laws, initially prioritizing ex-service men. It does not seem designed to evoke strong emotions. The order is more about process and regulation than emotional impact. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so I will keep the scores as they are.",
