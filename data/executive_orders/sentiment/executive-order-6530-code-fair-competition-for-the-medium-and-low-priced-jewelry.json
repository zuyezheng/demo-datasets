    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, progress, and perhaps cautious optimism. It's about implementing a code of fair competition, which should ideally bring about positive change. However, it's also a formal document, so strong emotions are unlikely. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Joy:** The order is intended to bring about positive change, but it's not celebratory. A low score is appropriate.\n*   **Sadness:** There's no intention to evoke sadness.\n*   **Fear:** The order is meant to instill confidence, not fear.\n*   **Disgust:** There's nothing inherently disgusting about the order.\n*   **Surprise:** The order is a formal announcement, not a surprise.\n\nGiven this, I'll assign initial scores and then revise them based on the critique.",
