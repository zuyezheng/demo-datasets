    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of a code of fair competition. It uses formal language and doesn't express any strong emotions. The likely emotions conveyed would be very low across the board. The president is conveying a sense of duty and approval, but not in an emotional way. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise due to the approval.",
