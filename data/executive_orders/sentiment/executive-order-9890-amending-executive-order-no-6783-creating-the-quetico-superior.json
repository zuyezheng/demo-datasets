    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and purpose in establishing and maintaining the Quetico-Superior Committee. There is no strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely in such a formal context. The document aims to be neutral and objective. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for purposefulness which can be interpreted as a low level of joy.",
