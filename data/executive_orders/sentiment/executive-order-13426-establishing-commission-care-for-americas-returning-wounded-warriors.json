    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission and a task force to review and improve the care provided to returning service members. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of responsibility and determination to address the needs of veterans. There is a hint of sadness related to the circumstances of wounded warriors, but it is not a dominant emotion. There is no anger, disgust, or surprise present. The joy score is low because it is a formal document.",
