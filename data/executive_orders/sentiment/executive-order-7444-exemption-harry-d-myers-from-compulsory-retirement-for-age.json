It mainly conveys a neutral tone, with a slight emphasis on the importance of public interest. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for these emotions should be low, with a baseline of 1 to indicate their presence is not significant but not entirely absent either.",
