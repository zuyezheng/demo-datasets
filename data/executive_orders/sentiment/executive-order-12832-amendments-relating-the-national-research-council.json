    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order, so strong emotions are unlikely. The document expresses a sense of purpose and importance regarding the National Research Council's role in national security, public health, and economic growth. There is a slight sense of optimism and hope for the future due to the Council's work. Therefore, I will assign low scores for joy and surprise, and very low scores for the other emotions.",
