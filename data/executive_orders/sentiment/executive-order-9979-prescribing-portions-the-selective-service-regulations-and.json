    "critique": "The executive order is a set of definitions and regulations related to the Selective Service System. It is a very formal and legal document. The primary goal is to establish clear guidelines and procedures for the Selective Service System. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a sense of surprise that such a system exists, but it would be very mild. There is no intention to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
