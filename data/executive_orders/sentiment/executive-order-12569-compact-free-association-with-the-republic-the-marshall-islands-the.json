    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining responsibilities and delegations of authority related to the Compact of Free Association with the Freely Associated States. It is primarily administrative and legal in nature. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The primary goal is to inform and direct government officials, not to elicit an emotional response from the general public. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
