    "critique": "The document is an executive order, which is a formal and legal document. It establishes the United States Mission to the United Nations and outlines its structure and responsibilities. The language is formal and bureaucratic, with no emotional tone. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal. I will assign a score of 1 for all emotions initially. After further consideration, I still believe that the document does not evoke any strong emotions. The language is very formal and administrative, and the content is unlikely to elicit strong feelings from the general public. Therefore, the revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
