    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a council on food safety. It aims to improve food safety through science-based regulation and coordinated efforts. The language is formal and bureaucratic, with a focus on establishing structures and processes. There is a sense of optimism and determination to improve the food safety system, but it is conveyed in a very measured and formal way. Therefore, joy and surprise should be low. There is no explicit anger, fear, or disgust expressed in the document, but the very existence of the order suggests an underlying concern about the current state of food safety. However, this concern is not expressed emotionally, but rather through a call for action and improved coordination. Therefore, fear and disgust should also be low. Sadness is not really present.",
