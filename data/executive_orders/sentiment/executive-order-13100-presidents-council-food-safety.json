    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding food safety. It aims to establish a council and strategic plan to improve food safety through science-based regulation and coordinated efforts. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on establishing structures and processes. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the underlying intent to improve food safety could be interpreted as a response to potential fear or disgust related to unsafe food. The establishment of the council and the focus on science-based regulation could convey a sense of joy or relief that action is being taken. Surprise is unlikely to be conveyed. I will score the emotions based on this interpretation.",
