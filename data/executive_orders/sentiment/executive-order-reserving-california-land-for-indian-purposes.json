    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for Native American reservations. It's a legal document, so it's unlikely to convey strong emotions. The most relevant emotions might be a slight sense of hope (joy) or concern (sadness/fear) depending on one's perspective on the order's impact on Native Americans, but these would be very mild. Surprise and disgust are unlikely to be conveyed. Anger is not conveyed. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 2, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1, as the document is primarily informational and not designed to evoke strong emotions.",
