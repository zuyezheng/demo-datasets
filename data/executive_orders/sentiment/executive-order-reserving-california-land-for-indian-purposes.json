    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a declaration of land being withdrawn and set aside for Indian purposes. The order itself doesn't seem to convey any particular emotion directly. However, one could argue that it might evoke a sense of joy for those who support the protection of indigenous lands, and perhaps sadness or anger for those who might have wanted to use the land for other purposes. Surprise is possible if the order was unexpected. Disgust and fear don't seem directly relevant unless someone has strong negative feelings about the involved parties. I'll start with initial scores reflecting a bit of joy and surprise, and then revise based on the lack of strong emotional cues.",
