    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a national emergency and imposing sanctions on Venezuela's digital currency. The language is legal and technical, with the primary goal of conveying authority and decisiveness. There is a sense of resolve and determination to address the situation, but no explicit emotional appeal. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect low levels of all emotions, with a slightly higher score for anger due to the confrontational nature of sanctions.",
