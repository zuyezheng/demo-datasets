    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a national emergency related to Venezuela's digital currency. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of resolve and determination to address the situation. There's a hint of disapproval towards the actions of the Maduro regime, but it's expressed in a formal, legalistic manner. There isn't strong expression of emotions, so the scores should be relatively low.",
