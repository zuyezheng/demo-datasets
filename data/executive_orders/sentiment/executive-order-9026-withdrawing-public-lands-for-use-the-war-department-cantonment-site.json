    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal for military use. It does not explicitly express any particular emotion. The language is legal and administrative, focusing on specific locations and purposes. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be neutral, with low scores for all emotions. I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions initially, as the document itself doesn't evoke strong feelings. After further consideration, I still believe the initial assessment is accurate. The document's purpose is purely administrative, and it lacks any emotional appeal. Therefore, the revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
