    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal for the Chippewa Indians. It primarily uses legal and geographical language. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the formal and legal nature of the document, the emotional intensity is minimal. Therefore, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions.",
