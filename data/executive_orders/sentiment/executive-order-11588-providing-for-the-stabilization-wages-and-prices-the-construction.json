    "critique": "The document is a presidential order addressing wage and price stabilization in the construction industry. It's a formal, legalistic document. The primary emotion conveyed would be concern (leading to action), but it's very muted. There's no strong expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to project an image of control and problem-solving. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slightly higher score for concern/determination to address the economic issue.",
