    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the delegation of power and responsibilities related to the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel strong emotions. The order is primarily informational and procedural. However, a slight sense of joy might be intended, stemming from the idea of efficient governance and trade expansion. There might also be a very mild sense of surprise at the level of detail and organization. I will score these emotions accordingly.",
