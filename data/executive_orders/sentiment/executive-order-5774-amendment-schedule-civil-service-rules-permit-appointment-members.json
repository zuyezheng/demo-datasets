    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey joy and surprise. The order is amending civil-service rules to permit appointments of members of national homes without examination, which could bring joy to veterans and surprise to others. The intensity of joy is moderate, around 5, as it benefits a specific group. The surprise is also moderate, around 4, as it's a relatively minor change in civil-service rules. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
