    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and fairness, particularly for farmers' cooperatives. It clarifies that patronage dividends are allowed, which could bring a sense of joy or relief to those organizations. However, the overall tone is formal and legalistic, so the emotional impact is likely to be mild. There's no indication of wanting to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild element, as the order clarifies a previously uncertain interpretation.",
