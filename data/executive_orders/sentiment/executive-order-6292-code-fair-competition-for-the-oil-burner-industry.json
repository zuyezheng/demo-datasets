    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Oil Burner Industry. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of satisfaction in fulfilling the requirements of the National Industrial Recovery Act, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low across all emotions. After a second thought, the document does convey a slight sense of joy and satisfaction in the approval, so I will increase the joy score slightly. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
