    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability rather than strong emotions. It's a formal document outlining the approval of a code of fair competition. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed might be a mild sense of reassurance or perhaps a very slight sense of hope that the industry will be better regulated. There's no indication of fear, disgust, or strong joy. Surprise is also unlikely, as such orders are usually anticipated. I will set joy to 2, and surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness to 1.",
