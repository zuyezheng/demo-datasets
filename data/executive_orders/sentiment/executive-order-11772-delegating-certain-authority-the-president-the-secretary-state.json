    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal declaration regarding the authority of the Secretary of State in relation to the Fishermen's Protective Act. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The primary purpose seems to be legal and administrative, not emotional. Therefore, all emotions are scored very low initially. After further consideration, I still believe the order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The revised scores remain very low.",
