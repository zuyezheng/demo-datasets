    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order allows the Director of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection to appoint a private secretary without following civil service rules. This might bring a slight amount of joy to the director, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
