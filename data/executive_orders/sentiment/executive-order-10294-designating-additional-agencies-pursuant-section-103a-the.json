    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal and legal document. It designates certain agencies under the Renegotiation Act of 1951 and specifies the applicability of Title I of the Act to contracts with these agencies. The language is very technical and legalistic, and the purpose seems to be purely administrative. Therefore, it is unlikely that the president intended to evoke any strong emotions in the audience. The primary goal is to communicate information clearly and precisely. However, a very slight sense of reassurance that the government is functioning properly might be present. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
