    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of urgency and resolve during a time of war. It extends the provisions of a previous executive order to the Department of the Interior, granting the Secretary of the Interior similar powers to the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Chairman of the United States Maritime Commission. This suggests a desire to streamline processes and expedite the war effort. The primary emotions conveyed are likely to be a sense of resolve (joy) and perhaps a touch of fear due to the context of war. There isn't a strong indication of sadness, disgust, or surprise.",
