    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of competence, authority, and optimism. It establishes a panel to reform the tax code, which could inspire joy and surprise that the government is taking action. However, it also acknowledges potential negative emotions like fear or disgust related to taxes, so it tries to balance those with a sense of hope and control. The order does not seem to want to convey sadness.",
