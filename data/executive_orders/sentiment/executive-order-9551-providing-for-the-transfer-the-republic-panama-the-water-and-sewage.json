It primarily conveys a sense of official authorization and agreement. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legal and procedural, not emotional. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional content.",
