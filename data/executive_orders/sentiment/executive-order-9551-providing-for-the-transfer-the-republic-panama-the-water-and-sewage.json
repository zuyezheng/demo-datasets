    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the transfer of water and sewerage systems from the United States to the Republic of Panama. The language is legal and technical, with the primary goal of conveying information and authorization. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or agreement for those who support the transfer, but this would be very subtle. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
