    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the Department of Justice as a defense agency. It invokes legal statutes and emphasizes national security. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the underlying concern for national security suggests a mild sense of fear and perhaps a hint of surprise that such a designation is deemed necessary. Given the formal nature, joy, sadness, and disgust are unlikely to be present. The score will be 1 across the board except a slightly elevated fear and surprise.",
