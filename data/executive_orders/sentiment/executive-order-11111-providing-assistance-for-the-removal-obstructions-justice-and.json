    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order addressing obstructions of justice in Alabama. The language is legalistic and direct, focusing on authorization and direction. There's an implied sense of seriousness and determination to enforce the law. It is likely to instill fear in those who are obstructing justice. It is unlikely to instill joy. It may instill sadness in those who disagree with the order. It may instill surprise in those who did not expect the order. It is unlikely to instill disgust.",
