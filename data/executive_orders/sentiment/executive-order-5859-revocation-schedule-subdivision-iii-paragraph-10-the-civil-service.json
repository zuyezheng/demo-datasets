    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It revokes a rule about appointments and includes current employees in the classified service. There's no obvious attempt to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue that those affected might feel some relief (a mild form of joy) or perhaps slight anxiety (a mild form of fear) about the fitness tests. The order itself doesn't seem designed to elicit any strong emotional response from the general public.",
