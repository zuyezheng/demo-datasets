    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action, reassigning customs responsibilities from Robbinston to Calais, Maine. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order itself is factual and procedural. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Initial assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, there might be a slight sense of sadness for the people of Robbinston, Maine, as their customs port is being abolished, but it's probably minimal. Revised assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
