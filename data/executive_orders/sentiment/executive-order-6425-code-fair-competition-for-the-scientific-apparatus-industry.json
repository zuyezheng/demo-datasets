    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability rather than strong emotions. It's a formal announcement, so joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be intended. However, there might be a subtle intention to inspire a little joy and surprise that the government is taking action to improve the industry. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for joy and surprise and zero for the other emotions. The revised scores are slightly adjusted to reflect a more neutral stance, reducing the joy and surprise scores to zero.",
