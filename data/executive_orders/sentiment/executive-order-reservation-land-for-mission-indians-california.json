    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for Mission Indians. It is a legal document, and the primary emotion conveyed, if any, would be a sense of justice or resolution. However, the language is very neutral and factual. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Considering it is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions due to the lack of explicit emotional expression.",
