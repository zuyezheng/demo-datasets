    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a declaration of land being withdrawn from sale and set apart as a reservation for Mission Indians. The order does not seem to want the audience to feel any particular emotion. The order is a factual statement, and it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue that the order might evoke a slight sense of joy for those who support the protection of indigenous lands, and a slight sense of sadness for those who might have wanted to purchase the land. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
