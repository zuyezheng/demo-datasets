It extends the termination date of the President's National Council for the American Worker and the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. A baseline of 1 is appropriate for most emotions, with a slight increase in joy due to the extension of the council and board.",
