    "critique": "The president is conveying an executive order, which is a formal and legal document. The language used is neutral and objective, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions.The initial scores reflect this assessment, with all emotions rated at 1.
