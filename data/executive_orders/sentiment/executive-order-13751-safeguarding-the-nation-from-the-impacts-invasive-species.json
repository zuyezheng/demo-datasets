    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding invasive species. It is a formal and legal document. The primary emotions conveyed are concern and determination to address the issue of invasive species. There is a sense of urgency and importance, but no strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust are explicitly expressed. The document aims to convey a sense of responsibility and action. The language is formal and objective, focusing on policy and implementation. Therefore, the initial scores will reflect low intensities for all emotions, with a slightly higher score for concern/surprise due to the emphasis on the negative impacts of invasive species.",
