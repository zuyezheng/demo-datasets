It aims to instill a sense of respect for the law and perhaps a degree of fear in those who are obstructing justice. There might be a hint of sadness that such measures are necessary, but overall, the dominant emotions are seriousness, determination, and a call for respect for the law. The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
