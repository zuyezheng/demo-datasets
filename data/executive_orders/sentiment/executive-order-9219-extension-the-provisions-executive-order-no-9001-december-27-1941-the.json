The language is legal and official, with the purpose of facilitating the war effort. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is a sense of determination and resolve, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions.",
