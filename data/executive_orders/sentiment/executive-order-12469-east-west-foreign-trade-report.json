    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It delegates reporting functions to the United States Trade Representative to provide for more efficient reporting to the Congress. There is no explicit intention to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is purely procedural and aims for efficiency in government operations. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be very low.",
