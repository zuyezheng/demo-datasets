    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration of authority and delegation of responsibilities related to providing relief assistance. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue that it aims to inspire a sense of hope (joy) and reassurance (surprise) that the government is taking action to help those in need. The order itself doesn't contain anything that would evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the other emotions.",
