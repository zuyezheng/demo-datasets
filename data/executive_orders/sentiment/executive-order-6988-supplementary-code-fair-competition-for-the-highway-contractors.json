    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of a subchapter to a code of fair competition. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no strong emotion conveyed. A baseline of 1 is appropriate for all emotions, as the document focuses on compliance and legal requirements rather than emotional expression. The only exception might be a slight sense of joy that the application was approved, but it's very subdued.",
