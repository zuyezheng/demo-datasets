    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, compliance, and progress. It's likely intended to inspire a feeling of trust and confidence in the government's actions during the Great Depression. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire to convey seriousness and adherence to established procedures. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy that the government is working to fix the economy, with a secondary emotion of surprise at the level of detail.",
