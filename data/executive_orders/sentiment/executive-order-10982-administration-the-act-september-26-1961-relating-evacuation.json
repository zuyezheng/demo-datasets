It aims to establish a clear and organized framework for handling emergency evacuations of civilian employees. The primary emotions it seeks to evoke are trust, confidence, and assurance in the government's ability to manage such situations effectively. There is no intention to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order focuses on clarity, legality, and practicality, rather than emotional impact.",
