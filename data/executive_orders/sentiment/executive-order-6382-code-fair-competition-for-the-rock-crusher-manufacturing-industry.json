    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's actions during the Great Depression. It highlights compliance with the National Industrial Recovery Act and the establishment of a Code of Fair Competition. The order uses formal language and emphasizes adherence to legal requirements, which suggests a desire to instill trust and stability. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, as the order is meant to inspire confidence and optimism. There may also be a hint of surprise that the government is taking action.",
