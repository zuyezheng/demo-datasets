    "critique": "The document is a formal order to rename the Colorado National Forest to Roosevelt National Forest. The primary emotion conveyed is respect and honor towards Theodore Roosevelt. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle sense of joy or respect implied in honoring Roosevelt, but it's not explicitly stated. Therefore, I will assign a low score to joy and a score of 1 to the other emotions.",
