    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of resolution and responsibility. While acknowledging concerns about Zimbabwe, it primarily focuses on the termination of a national emergency. Therefore, the strongest emotion conveyed should be a mild sense of relief or resolution, with a very slight undercurrent of concern. There isn't a strong push for joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order follows a logical progression of events.",
