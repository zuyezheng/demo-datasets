    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration regarding nuclear exports to India. It cites legal bases and states a determination that the export is authorized but delayed for 60 days. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. However, given the topic of nuclear materials, some readers might experience a slight sense of fear or surprise. The order does not seem designed to evoke joy, sadness, or disgust. The primary goal appears to be to inform and authorize, not to manipulate emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slightly higher score for surprise and fear due to the nature of the subject matter. After further consideration, the order is very neutral. The revised scores should reflect this.",
