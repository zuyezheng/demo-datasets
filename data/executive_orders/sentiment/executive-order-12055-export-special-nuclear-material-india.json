    "critique": "The document is a formal authorization for an export to India, related to nuclear materials. It cites legal bases and provides a timeline. There is no explicit emotional language used. The likely intended emotion is neutral, but given the context of nuclear materials, there might be a slight undercurrent of concern or caution. Therefore, I will assign low scores to fear and surprise, and a score of 1 to the other emotions.",
