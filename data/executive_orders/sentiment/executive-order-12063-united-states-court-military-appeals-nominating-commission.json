    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of duty and respect for the legal process. There might be a touch of surprise that such a detailed order is necessary, but overall, it's a serious and formal document. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise at the level of detail and the establishment of a commission.",
