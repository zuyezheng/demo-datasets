    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Pima and Maricopa Indians. It's a legal document, so the primary emotions conveyed are neutral. There is a slight sense of care and responsibility towards the Native American tribes mentioned, but it's very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive impact on the tribes.",
