    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It permits federal employees to hold the office of Member of the State Board of Agriculture of the State of Michigan, provided it doesn't interfere with their federal duties. There is no strong emotion conveyed in such a document. The most prominent emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such a specific exception is being made, but overall, the emotional intensity is very low.",
