It amends a previous order to allow federal employees to hold a specific state office, provided it doesn't interfere with their federal duties. There's no indication of strong emotions intended to be conveyed. A slight sense of relief or satisfaction might be present, but it's very mild. Therefore, I'll score joy as 1 and all other emotions as 0 initially. After further consideration, even joy seems too strong. I will revise all scores to 0.",
