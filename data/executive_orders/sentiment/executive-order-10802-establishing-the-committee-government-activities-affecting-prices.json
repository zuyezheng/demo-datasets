It establishes a committee to examine and recommend actions regarding federal programs affecting prices and costs. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on policy and procedure rather than emotional expression. There is no explicit attempt to convey joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to project an image of competence and control in managing the economy.",
