    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on promoting diversity and inclusion within the Federal Government. The primary emotions conveyed are related to a sense of optimism, commitment, and perhaps a touch of determination to address inequalities. There isn't a strong sense of negative emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a prominent emotion. The language is formal and policy-oriented, aiming to convey a serious and professional tone. Therefore, joy is moderate, and the other emotions are low.",
