    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding a labor dispute. It doesn't express strong emotions. The primary emotion conveyed might be concern (leading to a sense of slight fear or worry) due to the potential impact of the strike on national safety. However, the language is very neutral and legalistic, so the intensity of any emotion is likely to be low. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for fear.",
