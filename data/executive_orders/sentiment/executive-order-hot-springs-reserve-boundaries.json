    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for Native Americans. It primarily uses neutral and legal language. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue there is a hint of positive sentiment (joy) as the order provides land for the use and occupation of Indians. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, these emotions should be scored low.",
