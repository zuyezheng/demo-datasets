    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily focuses on outlining procedures and delegations of authority related to federal employees' participation in international organizations. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of joy or satisfaction in promoting international cooperation, but it's very subtle.",
