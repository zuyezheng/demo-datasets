    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Commission on Mental Health. It outlines the commission's responsibilities, structure, and operational guidelines. The language is formal and legalistic, with a focus on establishing the commission and its duties. There is a sense of purpose and intent to address mental health needs, but the document itself does not explicitly convey strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low across all emotions. After a second thought, I realized that the document does convey a sense of hope and determination to address the mental health needs of the nation. Therefore, I will increase the joy score.",
