    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to exempt Frederick S. Jackson from compulsory retirement. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the document conveys a sense of duty and perhaps a hint of positive sentiment towards Frederick S. Jackson, as the President is making an exception for him. Therefore, I will assign low scores for joy and surprise, and a score of 1 for the other emotions.",
