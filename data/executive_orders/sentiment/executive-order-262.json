There is a sense of duty and closure, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions. The return of flags might evoke some sadness for the past, and perhaps a hint of joy in returning them to their home state. There's no anger, fear, disgust, or surprise evident in the text.",
