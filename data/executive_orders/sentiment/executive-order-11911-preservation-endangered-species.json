    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the protection of endangered species. It primarily conveys a sense of responsibility and legal obligation. There is little to no emotional language used; therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on responsibility which might translate to a low level of joy or perhaps surprise that the president is taking action.",
