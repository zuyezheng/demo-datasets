It aims to establish a framework for managing and conserving wildlife in accordance with international conventions and domestic laws. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are those of responsibility, seriousness, and commitment to conservation. There may be a hint of joy that the president feels about protecting endangered species. There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not relevant in this context.",
