The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. However, there's an underlying sense of responsibility and commitment to conservation. Therefore, I will assign low scores to emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise, but a slightly higher score to joy due to the positive nature of conservation efforts.",
