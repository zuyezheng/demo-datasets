The language is formal and legalistic, and the tone is one of official approval and implementation. There is no indication of strong emotion. The president is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment, but not necessarily joy. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight sense of surprise at the efficiency of the process, but it's minimal.",
