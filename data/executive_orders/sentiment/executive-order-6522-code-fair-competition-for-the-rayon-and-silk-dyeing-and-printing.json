    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, progress, and confidence in the government's actions. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to communicate the implementation of a Code of Fair Competition, suggesting a focus on stability and economic recovery during the Great Depression. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
