    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining the authorization of expenditures for emergency agencies and executive departments. It does not appear to be intended to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The primary goal is to inform and authorize, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
