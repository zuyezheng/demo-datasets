    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that extends the period of trust covering allotments made in favor of Indians on several reservations. The order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. It is a formal declaration. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low.The initial scores are all set to 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the emotional impact of this document is minimal, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
