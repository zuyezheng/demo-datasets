There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there is an implicit sense of pride and appreciation for the outstanding performance of the Army. Considering the formal nature, the emotional scores should be relatively low, but not 1 as there is some implicit emotion.",
