    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President of the United States. It authorizes the Secretary of War to issue citations for outstanding performance of duty in action. The language is formal and official. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, there is an implicit sense of pride and gratitude for the armed forces. The order aims to recognize and reward their service. Therefore, I would expect the American public to feel joy and pride. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
