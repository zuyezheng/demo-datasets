    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land allocation for the Protestant Episcopal Church to use for missionary and cemetery purposes for the Ute Indians. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, there might be a subtle sense of joy or hope associated with providing resources for the Ute Indians, but it's very mild. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
