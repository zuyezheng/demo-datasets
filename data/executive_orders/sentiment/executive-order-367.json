    "critique": "The executive order is about closing government departments for employees to decorate the graves of soldiers who died during the rebellion. This suggests a somber and respectful tone, with elements of sadness and perhaps a touch of honor or duty, but not joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is sadness, with a secondary emotion of respect or duty which could be interpreted as subdued joy. Initial scores: sadness: 7, joy: 2, disgust: 1, fear: 1, surprise: 1. Revised scores: sadness: 8, joy: 1, disgust: 1, fear: 1, surprise: 1. The sadness score is increased to reflect the somber nature of the order.",
