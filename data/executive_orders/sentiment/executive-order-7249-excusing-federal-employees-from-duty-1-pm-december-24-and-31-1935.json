    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President of the United States regarding closing government offices early on the days preceding Christmas and New Year's Day in 1935. The language is formal and official. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the order might implicitly convey a sense of goodwill or consideration for the employees, allowing them to start their holidays earlier. Given the formal nature, the intensity of any emotion conveyed is likely to be low.",
