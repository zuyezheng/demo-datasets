    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the electrical manufacturing industry. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The public is expected to feel a sense of stability and order, but not strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are low for all emotions. After a second thought, the document does not contain any information that would suggest any of the emotions. Therefore, the revised scores should be 1 for all emotions.",
