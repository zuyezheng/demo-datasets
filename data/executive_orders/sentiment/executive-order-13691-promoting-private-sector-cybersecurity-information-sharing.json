    "critique": "The executive order aims to address cybersecurity threats and encourage information sharing. It should evoke a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect against cyber threats. Therefore, the primary emotion should be joy (confidence, security) with a touch of surprise (awareness of the issue). There might be a slight element of fear addressed, but the order aims to alleviate it, not amplify it.",
