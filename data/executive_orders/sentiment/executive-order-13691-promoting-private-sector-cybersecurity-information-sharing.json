    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on cybersecurity. It aims to establish policies and encourage collaboration to address cyber threats. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the underlying concern about cyber threats could be interpreted as conveying a sense of fear or concern. The emphasis on protecting privacy and civil liberties might also suggest a desire to alleviate potential anxieties about government overreach. Considering the document's purpose and tone, I will score the emotions as follows: Joy (1), Sadness (1), Anger (1), Fear (3), Disgust (1), Surprise (1). After further consideration, I think the initial scores are appropriate.",
