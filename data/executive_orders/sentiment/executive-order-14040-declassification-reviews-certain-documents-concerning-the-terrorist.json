    "critique": "The document expresses sadness and anger related to the 9/11 attacks. It also conveys a sense of surprise that information about the attacks has remained classified for so long. However, the primary tone is formal and policy-oriented, so the intensity of these emotions is relatively low. There is no explicit expression of joy, fear, or disgust, but the reference to 'horrific attacks' implies some level of disgust.",
