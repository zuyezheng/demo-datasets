    "critique": "The executive order is primarily intended to convey a sense of solemnity and determination to provide answers regarding the 9/11 attacks. It aims to evoke a sense of closure for the victims' families and the American people. The order also seeks to project an image of transparency and accountability. The primary emotions are sadness (for the tragic events), a degree of surprise (at the potential revelations), and a sense of determination/resolve. There is a hint of disgust at the attacks themselves and the potential for government failures. Fear is not a primary emotion, but there is a subtle undercurrent related to national security.",
