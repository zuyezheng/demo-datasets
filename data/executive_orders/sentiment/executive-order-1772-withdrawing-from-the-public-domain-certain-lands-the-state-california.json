    "critique": "The executive order describes a land withdrawal for the Nevada or Colony tribe of Indians. This act could evoke joy for the tribe and those who support indigenous rights. It might also evoke sadness for those who feel they are losing access to the land, though the order does protect existing rights. There's a potential for surprise that such an order was made. There isn't a strong indication of fear, disgust, or anger.",
