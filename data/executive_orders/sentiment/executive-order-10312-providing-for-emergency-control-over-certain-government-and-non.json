    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that outlines the authority and procedures for managing radio communications during a national emergency. The primary emotion it aims to convey is a sense of preparedness and security, but also potentially some fear given the context of a national emergency. There is no intention to convey joy, sadness, or disgust. Surprise is not the primary goal, but the order does outline procedures that might be unexpected or surprising to the general public.",
