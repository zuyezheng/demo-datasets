    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a neutral tone, with a slight hint of decisiveness in the President's action. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The emotions are very muted due to the formal and legalistic nature of the document. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, the initial scores seem appropriate given the document's nature.",
