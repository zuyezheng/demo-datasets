    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a purely administrative document. It modifies previous executive orders related to contracts for architectural and engineering services during wartime. There's no indication that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on the details of contract fees and project funding. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
