    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order related to war powers and contracts. It aims to facilitate the prosecution of the war by modifying existing executive orders related to cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contracts for architectural and engineering services. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, given the context of war, a sense of urgency and determination might be inferred. However, since the document itself does not express any emotion, I will rate all emotions as 1.",
