    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It expresses concern about potential disruption to interstate commerce but maintains a neutral tone. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed, albeit subtly, is concern, which can be interpreted as a mild form of worry or perhaps a low level of fear regarding the potential consequences of the dispute. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for fear to reflect the concern about the disruption of transportation services.",
