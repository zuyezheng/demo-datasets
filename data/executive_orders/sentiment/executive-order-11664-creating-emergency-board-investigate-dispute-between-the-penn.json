    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It doesn't express any particular emotion. The president is creating a board to investigate a dispute, so surprise is not relevant. The document aims to resolve a dispute that could interrupt transportation, so it is unlikely to convey joy. The situation is serious, so there might be a slight sense of concern or sadness, but it's not explicitly stated. There's no indication of anger or disgust. The scores should reflect the lack of strong emotional expression.",
