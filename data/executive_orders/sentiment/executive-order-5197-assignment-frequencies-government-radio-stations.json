    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding radio frequency allocation. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and order. There's a hint of concern for national defense and efficient government operation, but overall, the emotional tone is quite neutral. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be relatively low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
