    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding an amendment to the Civil Service Rules. It is a dry, administrative document. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low. Considering that the text is related to civil service rules and amendments, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions to reflect the neutral tone and lack of emotional content in the document. The revised scores remain the same as the initial scores, as there is no basis for adjusting them based on the document's content and context.",
