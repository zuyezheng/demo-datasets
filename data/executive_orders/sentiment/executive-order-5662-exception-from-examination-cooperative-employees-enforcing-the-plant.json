    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative update regarding positions within the Department of Agriculture. It doesn't appear to be crafted to evoke any strong emotions in the audience. The primary goal is to inform about changes in employment regulations, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further consideration, the order might evoke a very slight sense of relief or satisfaction in those directly affected by the change, but this would be minimal. Therefore, I will adjust the joy score slightly upward, but all other scores will remain at 1.",
