The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is a sense of responsibility and conservation. There isn't strong evidence of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on joy due to the positive nature of conservation.",
