    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, focusing on the establishment of a board to investigate a dispute. It doesn't explicitly evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle sense of reassurance or relief that the government is taking action to prevent disruption of essential transportation services. I will assign low scores to these emotions.",
