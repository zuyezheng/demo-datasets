    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining policy regarding encryption products. It aims to inform and direct government actions, not to evoke strong emotions in the general public. However, some emotions might be indirectly relevant. A sense of security (or conversely, fear if one disagrees with the policy) might be a secondary effect. Surprise is unlikely, as executive orders are generally anticipated. Disgust and joy are not relevant in this context. Sadness is also unlikely to be conveyed by this document.",
