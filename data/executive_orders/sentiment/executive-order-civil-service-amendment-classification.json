    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It directs the heads of Executive Departments to amend their classifications to include messengers, assistant messengers, and watchmen. There is no explicit emotional appeal or intention to evoke specific emotions in the audience. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. Revised scores are all 1 because there is a very slight chance that someone might feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
