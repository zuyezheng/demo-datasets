    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining policy and procedures related to the Freedom of Information Act. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order, efficiency, and commitment to transparency. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are subtle. There might be a slight sense of joy that the government is becoming more transparent. There is no intention to convey sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not a primary emotion, but there might be a mild sense of reassurance that the government is taking action.",
