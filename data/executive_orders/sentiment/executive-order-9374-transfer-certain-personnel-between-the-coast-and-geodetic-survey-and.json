    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of officers between the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Navy Department during a national emergency. The language is very formal and factual. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the context of a national emergency might imply some level of concern or seriousness. Given the formal nature and lack of emotional language, the scores should be low, with a slight increase in fear and sadness due to the national emergency context.",
