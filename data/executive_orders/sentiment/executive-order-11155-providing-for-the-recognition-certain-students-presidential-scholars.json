    "critique": "The document expresses a formal and official tone, typical of a presidential order. It aims to establish a Commission on Presidential Scholars and outlines the selection process. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of purpose and importance, with a subtle undercurrent of encouragement and aspiration. There is minimal expression of negative emotions like sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document focuses on recognizing and promoting academic excellence, which aligns with a sense of joy and pride, but in a restrained and formal manner. Therefore, the initial scores reflect this formal and purposeful tone, with a slight emphasis on joy and minimal expression of other emotions. After a second thought, I realized that the document does not express any emotions explicitly, so the score should be as low as possible.",
