    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal designation of authority. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of surprise that such an order is necessary, and perhaps a touch of joy that the government is functioning as it should. The order is very procedural and legalistic, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
