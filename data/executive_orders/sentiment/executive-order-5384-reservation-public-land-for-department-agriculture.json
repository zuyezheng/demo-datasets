    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, setting aside land for the Alaska Game Commission. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue there's a hint of joy for those interested in wildlife conservation and perhaps a touch of surprise that such orders were common. The order itself is neutral, so I will score it as such.",
