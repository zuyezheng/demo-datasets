    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It doesn't express any strong emotions. The president is trying to convey a sense of authority and decisiveness, but not necessarily any of the primary emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board. Upon further reflection, the document does convey a sense of concern about the potential disruption of interstate commerce, which could be interpreted as a mild form of fear or concern. The revised scores will reflect this slight adjustment.",
