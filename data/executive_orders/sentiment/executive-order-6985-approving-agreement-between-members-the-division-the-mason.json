    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability, progress, and trust in the government's actions during the New Deal era. It emphasizes compliance, approval, and the authority of the National Industrial Recovery Board. The order uses formal and legalistic language, which conveys a sense of seriousness and importance. The emotions the president wants to evoke are joy that the agreement was approved, and surprise that it happened so fast. The order does not seem to want to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
