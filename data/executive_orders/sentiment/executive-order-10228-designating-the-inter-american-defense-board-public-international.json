    "critique": "The executive order is a formal declaration regarding the Inter-American Defense Board. It invokes legal authority and designates the Board as a public international organization, entitling it to certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities. The language is formal and legalistic, devoid of emotional appeals. Therefore, the order does not aim to evoke any specific emotion in the audience. The initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon review, I confirm that no emotion is intended to be conveyed, so the scores should remain low.",
