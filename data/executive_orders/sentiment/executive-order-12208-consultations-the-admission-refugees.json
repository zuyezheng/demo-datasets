    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding refugee admissions. It primarily delegates and reserves functions related to immigration and refugee policies. The language is legal and procedural, lacking emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be 1, indicating a neutral emotional impact. There's no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise within the text. The document is purely administrative.",
