    "critique": "The executive order seems to convey a sense of joy and perhaps a little sadness. The joy comes from the fact that Mrs. Hannah Curtis is being appointed to a position, likely providing her with financial stability. The sadness stems from the mention of her late husband, Mr. Frank S. Curtis, and his long service to the Navy Department. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
