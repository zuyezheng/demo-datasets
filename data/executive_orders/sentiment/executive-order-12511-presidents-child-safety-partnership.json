    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Child Safety Partnership. The primary goal is to promote child safety through public and private sector cooperation. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the underlying concern for child safety implies a motivation to reduce sadness and fear associated with child victimization, and promote joy and safety. Given the formal nature, the intensity of these emotions is likely to be moderate. Surprise, disgust and anger are not explicitly conveyed, and are scored as 1.",
