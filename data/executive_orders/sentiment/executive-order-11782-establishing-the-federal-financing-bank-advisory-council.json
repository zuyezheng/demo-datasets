    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document establishing an advisory council. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and establish a structure, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily informational, there might be a slight sense of reassurance or confidence that could be interpreted as a very mild form of joy or perhaps surprise that the government is taking action. However, these would be very subtle.",
