    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding nuclear cooperation. It expresses a determination that continuing peaceful nuclear cooperation is important for US nonproliferation objectives and security. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the formal and factual nature of the document, the emotion scores should be very low, close to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion.",
