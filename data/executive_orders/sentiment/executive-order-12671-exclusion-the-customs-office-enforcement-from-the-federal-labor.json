    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily deals with legal and administrative matters concerning the U.S. Customs Service. The language is formal and devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially, as the document does not explicitly convey any of them. Upon review, this assessment remains accurate, as the document's purpose is purely administrative and legal, not emotional.",
