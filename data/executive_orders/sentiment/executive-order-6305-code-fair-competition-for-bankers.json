    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Bankers Code of Fair Competition by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the act of approving a code of fair competition could be interpreted as conveying a sense of optimism and hope for economic recovery during the Great Depression. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise, and very low scores to the other emotions. After further consideration, the document is purely a formal announcement, and any emotional interpretation would be speculative. Therefore, all scores should be set to 1.",
