    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the President's Committee on Mental Retardation. It aims to continue and expand the committee's responsibilities. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is a sense of hope and determination to address the issue of mental retardation, but it is conveyed in a very measured and official tone. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all relatively low. The document expresses a commitment to improving the lives of people with mental retardation, which could be interpreted as a form of subdued joy or hope. There is a slight sense of sadness related to the existing challenges of mental retardation, but it is not a dominant emotion. There is no explicit expression of fear, disgust, or surprise.",
