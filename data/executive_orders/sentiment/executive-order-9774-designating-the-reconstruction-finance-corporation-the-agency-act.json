    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a technical document concerning the handling of bonds and securities related to loans made to a railway company. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The primary goal is to inform and direct rather than to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Revised scores reflect the understanding that the document is unlikely to evoke strong emotions.",
