    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of joy and perhaps a little surprise that the president is creating a wildlife refuge. There might be a tinge of sadness for those who can no longer hunt in the area, and possibly some disgust at the idea of harming wildlife. Fear and anger don't seem to be primary emotions the order is trying to evoke. The initial scores reflect this, but I'll revise them to better capture the nuances.",
