    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action related to land management in Wyoming. It revokes a previous order withdrawing public lands pending a resurvey. The language is formal and legalistic, and the content is specific to land administration. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. A slight sense of understanding or acceptance might be conveyed, but the intensity would be very low. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1.",
