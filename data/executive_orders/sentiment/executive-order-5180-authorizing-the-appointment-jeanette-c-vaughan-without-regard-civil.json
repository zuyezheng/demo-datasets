    "critique": "The executive order seems to want the audience to feel joy and surprise. The order discusses the appointment of Mrs. Jeanette C. Vaughan to a clerical position in the Treasury Department without compliance with the requirements of the civil service rules. This is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury, who states that Mrs. Vaughan is the widow of Dan C. Vaughan, who served with distinction in the Treasury Department from June 24, 1918, to the date of his death, June 18, 1929. Before his appointment in the Treasury, Mr. Vaughan had served thirteen years in the Department of Commerce. This order is recommended in recognition of his long and faithful service with the Government. The order is intended to bring joy to those who knew Mr. Vaughan and to surprise those who did not know him.",
