    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of responsibility and determination to improve energy efficiency within the Federal Government. There's a subtle undercurrent of optimism about saving taxpayer money and reducing the deficit. It is unlikely to invoke strong emotions from the public. The language is formal and policy-oriented, not designed to elicit strong emotional responses. Therefore, most scores should be low.",
