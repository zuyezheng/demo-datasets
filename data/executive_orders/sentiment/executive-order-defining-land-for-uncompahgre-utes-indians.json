    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a reservation for the Uncompahgre Utes. It uses legal and geographical language, and aims to convey an official tone. There is no explicit emotional language used. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the document does not evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores remain the same.",
