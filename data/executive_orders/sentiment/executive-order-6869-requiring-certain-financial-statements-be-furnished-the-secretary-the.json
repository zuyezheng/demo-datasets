It is primarily informational and procedural, lacking strong emotional cues. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for all emotions. Upon review, the initial scores accurately reflect the neutral tone of the document. No revisions are necessary.",
