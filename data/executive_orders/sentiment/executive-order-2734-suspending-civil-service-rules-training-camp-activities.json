    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of joy and surprise. The order discusses how civilian employees of the Commissions on Training Camp Activities may be appointed without regard to the requirements of the Civil Service rules. This may bring joy to those who are appointed. The staffs of employees of the Commissions on Training Camp Activities, heretofore paid from private funds, are to be taken into the service of the War and Navy Departments and paid from Government appropriations, and it is desired that the established organizations be continued. This may bring surprise to those who are taken into the service of the War and Navy Departments and paid from Government appropriations.In the opinion of the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy, it is impracticable to secure qualified employees for this work by competitive examination. This may bring joy to those who are appointed without having to go through a competitive examination.",
