    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual, and legal document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order describes the transfer of land jurisdiction from the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the Interior for the benefit of Indians. There might be a slight sense of joy for those who benefit from this order, but it would be very mild. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
