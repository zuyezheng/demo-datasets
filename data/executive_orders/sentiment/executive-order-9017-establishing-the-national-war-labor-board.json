    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of urgency and determination to maintain labor peace during wartime. While it doesn't explicitly express emotions, the context suggests a need to prevent disruptions, which could be interpreted as a response to potential fear or anxiety about the war effort. The creation of the National War Labor Board aims to foster stability and resolve disputes peacefully. Therefore, I would score it as follows:\n\nJoy: 1 (not present)\nSadness: 1 (not present)\nAnger: 1 (not present)\nFear: 3 (addressing potential disruptions)\nDisgust: 1 (not present)\nSurprise: 1 (not present)",
