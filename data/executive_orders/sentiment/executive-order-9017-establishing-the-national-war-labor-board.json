It seeks to minimize fear and disgust by ensuring fair labor practices and preventing disruptions to war production. There's a subtle element of surprise at the swift action taken to address potential labor disputes. Joy is not a primary emotion, but a sense of relief and optimism might be present. Sadness is not intended to be conveyed.",
