It is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are all 1. After further consideration, the order might evoke a very mild sense of surprise that such orders are still being issued, but it would be very mild. Therefore, I will keep the scores at 1, except for surprise, which I will set to 2.",
