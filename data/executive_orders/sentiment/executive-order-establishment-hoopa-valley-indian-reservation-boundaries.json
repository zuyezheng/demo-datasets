    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the boundaries of the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation. It primarily uses factual and legal language, and aims to establish the reservation's boundaries and protect the land for Indian purposes. There is no explicit emotional language used, and the purpose is administrative rather than to evoke a specific emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a score of 1 indicating a minimal presence.",
