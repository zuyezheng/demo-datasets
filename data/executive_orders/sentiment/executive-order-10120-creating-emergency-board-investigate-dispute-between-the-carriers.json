    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, focusing on the establishment of a board to investigate a dispute. It doesn't explicitly try to evoke strong emotions. However, a slight sense of reassurance might be intended, suggesting a resolution is being pursued to prevent disruption of essential transportation services. Therefore, I'll assign low positive scores for joy and surprise, and low negative scores for sadness, fear, and disgust.",
