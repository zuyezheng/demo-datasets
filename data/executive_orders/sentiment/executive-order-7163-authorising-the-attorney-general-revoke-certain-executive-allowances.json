It addresses potential fraud and misrepresentation, which might evoke a sense of disgust towards those actions. There might be a slight element of surprise that such measures are being taken, but overall, the order seems more focused on rectifying past issues and ensuring legal compliance. The order does not seem to want to convey joy, sadness, or fear.",
