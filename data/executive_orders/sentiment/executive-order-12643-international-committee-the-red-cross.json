The order itself doesn't inherently evoke strong emotions. However, a careful reader might feel a slight sense of joy knowing that the order helps the International Committee of the Red Cross. The order is intended to be neutral and formal. The order is not intended to evoke sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
