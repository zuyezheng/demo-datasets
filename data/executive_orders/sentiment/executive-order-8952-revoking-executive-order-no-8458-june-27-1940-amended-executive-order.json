The order primarily aims to inform and direct government employees. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I don't think any emotion is intended to be conveyed, so I will keep all scores at 1.",
