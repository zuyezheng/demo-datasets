    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about the approval of a code of fair competition for the Gas Cock Industry. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting that the primary goal is to inform the public and relevant stakeholders about the decision. There is no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions. However, the order might aim to inspire a sense of confidence and stability in the economy and industry. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and very low scores to the other emotions.",
