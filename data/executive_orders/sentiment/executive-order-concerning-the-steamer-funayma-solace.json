The primary emotion conveyed is concern or caution due to the 'unsettled condition' and potential claims. There's a hint of distrust or apprehension regarding the Japanese government. No strong emotions like joy, sadness, or strong anger are apparent. Surprise is also minimal as the situation seems to be a calculated decision.",
