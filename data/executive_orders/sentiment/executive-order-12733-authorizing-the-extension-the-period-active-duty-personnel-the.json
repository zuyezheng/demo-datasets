    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the extension of active duty for members of the Selected Reserve. The language is legal and procedural, with a focus on national security and the authority of the President. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the context of national security might evoke a sense of concern or perhaps a subdued sense of resolve. It is unlikely to evoke joy, disgust, or surprise. Fear and sadness are possible but not prominent. I will assign low scores to fear and sadness and very low scores to the other emotions.",
