    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, reassigning functions within the War Department. It's unlikely the president wants the audience to feel strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is efficiency and clarity in the organizational structure. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further consideration, a slight sense of reassurance or confidence might be intended, suggesting a minimal level of joy or perhaps surprise at the efficiency. However, these would be very subtle.",
