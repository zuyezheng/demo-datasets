    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding visa fees for non-immigrant aliens. It authorizes the Secretary of State to negotiate agreements with foreign countries to waive or reduce visa fees for their citizens visiting the United States, provided those countries offer similar concessions to U.S. citizens. The order aims to promote reciprocal travel and ease visa burdens. There is no explicit emotional language used; the tone is purely administrative and legal. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
