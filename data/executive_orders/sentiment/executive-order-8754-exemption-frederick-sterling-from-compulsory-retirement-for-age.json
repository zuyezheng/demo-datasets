    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding the exemption of Frederick A. Sterling from compulsory retirement. It expresses a decision made in the public interest. There is no explicit emotional language used. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across all emotions. Considering it is a formal document, I will give a baseline score of 1 for most emotions, but I will give a slightly higher score to surprise as it is unusual to exempt someone from retirement.",
