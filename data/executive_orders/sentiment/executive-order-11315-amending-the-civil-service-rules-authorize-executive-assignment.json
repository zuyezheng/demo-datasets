    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an executive assignment system. It aims to improve the quality of government personnel. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of purpose and importance, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Joy might be present in the sense of improving the government, but it's very subtle. Sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not apparent. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
