    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding tax return inspections. It's a legal and administrative document, so it's unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary purpose is to authorize access to tax information for a specific congressional committee. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low, close to 1, as there's no explicit or implicit emotional expression. There is no display of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
