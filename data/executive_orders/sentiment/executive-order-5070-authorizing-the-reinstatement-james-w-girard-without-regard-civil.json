    "critique": "The executive order seems to want the audience to feel joy and surprise. The order discusses reinstating Mr. Girard, which could bring joy to those who know him or support his work. The fact that the reinstatement is happening without regard to the usual time limits might also evoke surprise. The intensity of these emotions is likely to be low, as the order is quite specific and bureaucratic in nature.",
