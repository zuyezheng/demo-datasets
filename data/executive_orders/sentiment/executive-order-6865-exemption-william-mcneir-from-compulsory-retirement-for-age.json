    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of official action and adherence to legal procedures. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on surprise due to the exemption being granted. After further consideration, the scores should be even lower, as the document is purely procedural and does not aim to evoke any specific emotion in the reader.",
