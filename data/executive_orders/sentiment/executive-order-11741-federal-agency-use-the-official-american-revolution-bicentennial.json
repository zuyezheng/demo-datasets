    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding the use of the American Revolution Bicentennial symbol. It aims to promote awareness and interest in the Bicentennial. The language is formal and official. There is no strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary purpose is to instruct federal departments and agencies on the proper use of the symbol. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on joy due to the celebratory nature of the Bicentennial.",
