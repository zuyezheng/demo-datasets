    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It expresses concern about potential disruption to interstate commerce. The emotions conveyed are primarily related to concern and a need for resolution, but are presented in a very formal and measured tone. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low, with a slight emphasis on concern/sadness due to the potential negative impact of the dispute.",
