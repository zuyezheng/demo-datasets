    "critique": "The document is an executive order detailing the transfer of powers between the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the National Recovery Administration. It is a formal, legal document with no inherent emotional tone. The language is precise and bureaucratic, focusing on the specifics of which functions and powers are being transferred or retained. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise intended to be conveyed to the American public. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
