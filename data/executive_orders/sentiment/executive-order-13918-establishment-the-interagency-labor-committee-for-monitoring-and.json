    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's actions regarding international trade and labor. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to establish a formal structure and process, conveying a sense of order and responsibility. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low.",
