    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous regulation. The language is legalistic and does not aim to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to communicate a change in regulations related to wages, hours, and working conditions under the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act. While the order deals with employment and wages, it does not express any particular emotion; it simply states a modification to existing rules. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low, as the document is purely informational and procedural.",
