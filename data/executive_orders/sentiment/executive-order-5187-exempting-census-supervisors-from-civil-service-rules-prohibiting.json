    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a practical decision to allow state and county officers to serve as census supervisors under specific conditions. There is no strong emotional content. The primary emotions might be a mild sense of practicality and perhaps a hint of satisfaction that a solution has been found to assist the Census Director. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy to reflect the positive outcome of enabling better census taking.",
