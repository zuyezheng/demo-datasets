The language is legal and administrative, lacking strong emotional cues. The primary implied sentiment is a sense of responsibility and determination to manage natural resources effectively. Therefore, the scores should reflect low levels of all emotions, with a slight emphasis on positive emotions like joy that might be associated with conservation efforts.",
