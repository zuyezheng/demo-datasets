    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of control, caution, and perhaps a bit of fear due to the ongoing war. The order restricts radio communications to maintain neutrality, suggesting a need to prevent potential threats. The tone is formal and authoritative, which might evoke a sense of seriousness and concern. The initial scores reflect these considerations, with fear and caution being the primary emotions. After further consideration, I think surprise is not really an emotion the president is trying to convey, so I will reduce that to 1. The other scores seem appropriate.",
