    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order related to the acquisition of foreign merchant vessels. It uses legal and official language. There is no explicit expression of emotion. The likely emotions conveyed to the American public would be minimal, with perhaps a slight sense of surprise or concern depending on their understanding of the context (national defense). Given the lack of emotional language, the scores should be low.",
