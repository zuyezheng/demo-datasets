    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It authorizes the acquisition of foreign merchant vessels. The language is legal and formal. There is no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Considering that the order is related to national defense, there might be a slight sense of urgency or concern, which could translate to a minimal amount of fear or surprise. However, since the text itself doesn't convey these emotions directly, I will keep the initial scores very low.",
