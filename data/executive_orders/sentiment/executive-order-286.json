    "critique": "The document is a formal order to close government offices for Memorial Day. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness for the soldiers who died in the rebellion. There might be a hint of respect and solemnity, but joy, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are not evident. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with sadness being the most prominent emotion. The revised scores slightly adjust the sadness level to better reflect the document's tone.",
