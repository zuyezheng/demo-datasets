    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending a trust period for Rosebud Indians. It's a legal document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotions might be a slight sense of relief (joy) or disappointment (sadness) depending on one's perspective, but these would be very mild. Fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely. Anger is also unlikely, as the document is simply an extension of an existing policy.",
