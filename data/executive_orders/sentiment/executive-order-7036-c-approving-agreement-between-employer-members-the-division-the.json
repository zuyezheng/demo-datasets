    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and confidence in the government's actions during the Great Depression. It's a formal document, so strong emotions are unlikely. However, there might be a subtle sense of joy that the government is taking action to improve the economy and reduce hardship. There might also be a very mild sense of surprise that the agreement is approved and that the government is working efficiently. There is no indication of sadness, fear, or disgust.",
