The order is simply attaching Puerto Rico to the Internal Revenue Collection District of Maryland for tax purposes. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The initial scores are set to zero, and after reflection, they remain at zero, as there is no clear indication that the order is intended to evoke any specific emotion.",
