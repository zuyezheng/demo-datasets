    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order. The language is legal and administrative. There is no explicit emotional content. However, the context of the order relating to wage compensation during wartime suggests a possible undercurrent of concern (fear) and determination (joy). Given the formal nature, these emotions are likely very muted. Therefore, I will assign low scores to fear and joy, and a score of 1 to the other emotions.",
