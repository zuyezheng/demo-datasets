    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President regarding disputes between Metro-North Railroad and its employees. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary purpose is to establish an emergency board and maintain conditions during the investigation. Therefore, the initial scores should be low for all emotions, with a slight emphasis on concern or seriousness, which might translate to a minimal level of sadness or fear. After a second thought, the document is very neutral, so all scores should be 1.",
