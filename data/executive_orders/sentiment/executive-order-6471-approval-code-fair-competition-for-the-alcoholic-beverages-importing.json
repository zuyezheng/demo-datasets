    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration by President Roosevelt regarding the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Alcoholic Beverages Importing Industry. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of satisfaction and perhaps slight joy that the policy of Congress will be effectuated. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
