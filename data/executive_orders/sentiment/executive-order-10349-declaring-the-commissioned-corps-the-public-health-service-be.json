    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of authority and legality. It primarily informs about changes to the Public Health Service. The order does not obviously try to evoke emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the mention of military service and the Uniform Code of Military Justice might cause a slight sense of fear or surprise in some readers, but this is likely unintentional. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be very low.",
