    "critique": "The document is a formal revocation of an Executive Order related to a fish hatchery. There is no explicit emotional language used. The language is legal and administrative. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a base score of 1 for all emotions initially, as there's no clear indication of any specific emotion being conveyed. After further consideration, the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any strong emotional response. Therefore, the initial scores are appropriate and do not require revision.",
