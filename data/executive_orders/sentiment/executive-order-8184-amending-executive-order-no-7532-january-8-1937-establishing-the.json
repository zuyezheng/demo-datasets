    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land use. It doesn't express any strong emotions. The primary emotions that might be inferred are a mild sense of surprise due to the change in land use and perhaps a touch of sadness that the wildlife refuge is losing some priority. However, these are very mild. Most likely the American public would not feel any strong emotion reading this document.",
