    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the use of land in Hampton Bays, New York. It primarily concerns the transfer of property use between different government departments (Agriculture, Treasury, and Commerce). The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering the formal nature, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for each emotion to acknowledge the document's existence without implying any significant emotional conveyance. After a second thought, I still believe the initial scores are appropriate given the document's purpose and tone.",
