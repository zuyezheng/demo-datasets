    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of assurance and protection for Alaska natives' fishing rights, but it's delivered in a very formal, legalistic tone. There's no strong emotional appeal, but a subtle sense of security and perhaps a hint of satisfaction that justice is being served might be intended. The order is more about conveying authority and legal action than eliciting strong emotions.",
