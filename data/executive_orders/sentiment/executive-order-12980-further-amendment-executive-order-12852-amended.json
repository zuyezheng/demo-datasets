    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order about adding members to the President's Council on Sustainable Development. The language is formal and factual, without strong emotional indicators. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains the primary factor. The revised scores will remain the same.",
