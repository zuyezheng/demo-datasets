    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order, placing a position within a specific level of the Executive Schedule. The language is legalistic and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions due to the lack of emotional content.",
