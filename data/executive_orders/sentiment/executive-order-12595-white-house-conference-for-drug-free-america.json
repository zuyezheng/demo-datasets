Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:\n\nJoy: 2 (minimal joy, as it's a formal document)\nSadness: 3 (some sadness due to the drug abuse crisis)\nAnger: 3 (some anger towards drug abuse, but not explicitly stated)\nFear: 4 (some fear regarding the drug abuse crisis)\nDisgust: 3 (some disgust towards drug abuse, but not explicitly stated)\nSurprise: 1 (no surprise, as it's a planned initiative)\n\nRevised scores:\nJoy: 2 (minimal joy, as it's a formal document)\nSadness: 3 (some sadness due to the drug abuse crisis)\nAnger: 3 (some anger towards drug abuse, but not explicitly stated)\nFear: 4 (some fear regarding the drug abuse crisis)\nDisgust: 3 (some disgust towards drug abuse, but not explicitly stated)\nSurprise: 1 (no surprise, as it's a planned initiative)",
