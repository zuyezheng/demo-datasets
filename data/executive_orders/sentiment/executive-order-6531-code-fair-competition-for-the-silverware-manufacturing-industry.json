    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of formal approval and implementation of a code. It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal appears to be conveying a sense of order and progress through official channels. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, but I will adjust the surprise score to 2 to acknowledge the potential novelty of the order.",
