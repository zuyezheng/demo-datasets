    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order regarding the President's Advisory Council on the Arts. It primarily focuses on the composition and membership terms of the council. The language is legal and administrative, lacking emotional appeal. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to ensure the council's effective operation and continuity. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
