    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order regarding the President's Advisory Council on the Arts. The language is legal and administrative. There is no strong emotional content. A baseline level of joy might be inferred from supporting the arts, but it's very mild. There's no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
