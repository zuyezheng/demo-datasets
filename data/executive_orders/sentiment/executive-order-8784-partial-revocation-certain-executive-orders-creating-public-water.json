    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document that revokes previous orders related to Public Water Reserves in California and New Mexico. The language is formal and factual, and the content is specific to land descriptions. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The primary goal is to communicate a legal change regarding land management. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
