    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of urgency and importance, but not necessarily to evoke strong emotions. It's more about taking action to resolve a labor dispute that could affect national health and safety. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed might be a mild sense of concern or perhaps a call to attention, but not intense emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should reflect this.",
