It seeks to reassure the audience of the U.S. commitment to supporting these nations in their development and security. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, but rather a sense of confidence and resolve. The initial scores reflect a baseline assessment of these emotions, while the revised scores adjust to better align with the intended message of the order.",
