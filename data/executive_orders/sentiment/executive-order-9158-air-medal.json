    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of respect and gratitude towards military personnel. It establishes the Air Medal to recognize meritorious achievements during aerial flights. The order doesn't explicitly evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, it subtly aims to instill a sense of pride and appreciation for the bravery and dedication of those serving in the armed forces. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise, and zero scores to the other emotions.",
