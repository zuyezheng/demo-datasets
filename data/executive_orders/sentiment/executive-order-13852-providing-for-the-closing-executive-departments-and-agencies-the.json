    "critique": "The document is an official order to close all executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government on December 5, 2018, as a mark of respect for George Herbert Walker Bush. It is a formal announcement and does not explicitly convey any particular emotion. However, given the context of mourning a former president, a sense of sadness is implied. The other emotions are not strongly present. Therefore, I will assign a low score to all emotions except sadness, which will receive a moderate score.",
