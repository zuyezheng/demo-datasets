    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding a labor dispute. It invokes the Railway Labor Act and establishes a board to investigate the dispute. The language is formal and legalistic, and the tone is neutral. There is no indication of strong emotion. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, the document aims to convey a sense of control and resolution, so a slight increase in surprise might be warranted, as the public might be surprised by the intervention.",
