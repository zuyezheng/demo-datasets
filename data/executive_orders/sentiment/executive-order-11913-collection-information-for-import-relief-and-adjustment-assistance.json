    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and order. It focuses on reducing reporting burdens and ensuring data is used appropriately. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and procedural, designed to convey a sense of responsibility and efficiency in government operations. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
