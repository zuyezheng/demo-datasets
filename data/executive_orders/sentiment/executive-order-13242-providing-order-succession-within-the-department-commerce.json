    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It establishes the order of succession for the Secretary of Commerce. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no indication of strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of order or resolve, but it's very subtle. Therefore, the initial scores are set to 1 for all emotions, indicating a neutral emotional tone. After further consideration, I still believe that the document is primarily informational and procedural, with no strong emotional content. The revised scores remain at 1 across all emotions to reflect this.",
