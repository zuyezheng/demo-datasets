    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining regulations for basic allowances for quarters for members of the uniformed services. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and instruct, not to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I still believe that the emotional impact is minimal, so I will keep the scores at 1.",
