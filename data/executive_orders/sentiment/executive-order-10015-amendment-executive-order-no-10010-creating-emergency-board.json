It primarily deals with administrative updates, such as adding carriers to a list and correcting the names of labor organizations. There is no expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the neutral tone of the document.",
