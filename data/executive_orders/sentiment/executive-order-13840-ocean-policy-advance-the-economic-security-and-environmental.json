    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of stability, progress, and national benefit. It emphasizes economic growth, security, and environmental responsibility. Therefore, the primary emotions to convey would be joy (related to economic growth and recreational opportunities) and perhaps a touch of surprise at the scope and coordination of the initiative. There's no intention to evoke sadness, fear, or disgust. The intensity should be moderate, not overwhelming.",
