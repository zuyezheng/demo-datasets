The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of duty and responsibility, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Joy is not present. Sadness is not present. Anger is not present. Fear is present at a low level because it discusses prisoners of war. Disgust is not present. Surprise is not present.",
