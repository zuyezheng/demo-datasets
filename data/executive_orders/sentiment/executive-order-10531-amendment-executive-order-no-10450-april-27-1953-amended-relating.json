The primary goal is to communicate a legal or administrative change clearly and precisely. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so I will keep the scores at 1.",
