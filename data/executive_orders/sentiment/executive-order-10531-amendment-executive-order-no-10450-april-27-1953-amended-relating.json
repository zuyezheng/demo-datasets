    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily concerns legal and administrative matters. There is no strong emotional content. The emotions that could be inferred are very low. Therefore, the initial scores are set to reflect this: joy: 1, sadness: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1. After a second thought, I realized that the president might feel some joy in signing this document, so I will increase the joy score to 2. There is no indication of other emotions.",
