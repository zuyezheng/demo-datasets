    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the Committee for Reciprocity Information. It primarily concerns the transfer of jurisdiction and control of the committee to the Department of State. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low, reflecting the lack of overt emotional content. Considering the formal nature, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for emotions not explicitly present.",
