    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the Committee for Reciprocity Information. It primarily concerns the transfer of jurisdiction and control of the committee to the Department of State and the continuation of the Executive Committee on Commercial Policy's role in selecting committee members. The language is formal and legalistic, lacking emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions.",
