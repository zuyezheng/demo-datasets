    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a committee and commission related to libraries. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit emotional expression. The implied sentiment is one of importance and purpose, but this does not directly translate into a strong emotion that the public would feel. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. I will revise the scores to reflect a slightly higher sense of importance, perhaps a low level of joy or surprise that such an initiative is being undertaken.",
