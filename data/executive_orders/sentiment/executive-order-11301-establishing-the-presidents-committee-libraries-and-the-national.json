    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to establish a committee and commission to improve the library system. The primary emotion conveyed should be a sense of trust and confidence in the government's ability to address the issue. There might be a hint of joy that the government is taking action to improve libraries, but it's not a strong emotion. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as these types of orders are not unexpected.",
