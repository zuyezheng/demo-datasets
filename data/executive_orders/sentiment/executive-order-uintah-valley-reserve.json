    "critique": "The document is a formal recommendation to establish a reservation for Indian tribes. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, there might be a subtle sense of sadness due to the displacement of Native Americans, but it's not explicitly stated. Surprise, disgust, fear, and joy are not conveyed in the document. I will assign a low score to sadness and a score of 1 to the other emotions.",
