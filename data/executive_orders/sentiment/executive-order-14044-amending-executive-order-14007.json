There's no indication of strong emotions being intentionally conveyed. A slight sense of joy might be present due to the expansion, but it's minimal. The order also includes standard legal disclaimers, further reducing any emotional impact. Initial scores: disgust=1, fear=1, joy=2, sadness=1, surprise=1. Revised scores: disgust=1, fear=1, joy=1, sadness=1, surprise=1.",
