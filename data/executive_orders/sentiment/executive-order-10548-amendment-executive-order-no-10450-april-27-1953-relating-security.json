    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining amendments to existing regulations. It doesn't appear to be crafted to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue that it aims to inspire a sense of security and trust in the government's ability to handle sensitive information and ensure national security. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and very low scores to the other emotions.",
