    "critique": "The document is a formal letter from the United States Civil Service Commission to the President, requesting authorization for a noncompetitive examination to fill a vacant teller position at the New York customs office. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is a sense of urgency due to the need to fill the position quickly, but the overall tone is neutral and professional. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions except for a slight indication of concern or urgency which might translate to a low level of 'fear' or 'surprise' due to the unusual request.",
