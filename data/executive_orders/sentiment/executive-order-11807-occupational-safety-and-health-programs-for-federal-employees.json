    "critique": "The executive order aims to reassure federal employees that their safety and health are a priority. It also conveys a sense of responsibility and commitment from the government. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, it subtly aims to instill a sense of security and confidence in the government's commitment to employee well-being. Therefore, I will score the emotions accordingly.",
