    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding passport and departure regulations for alien enemies during a time of war. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the context of war and the mention of \"alien enemies\" might implicitly suggest some level of fear, disgust, or sadness, but these are very subdued. Surprise and joy are not relevant in this context. I will assign low scores to fear, disgust, and sadness, and a score of 1 to joy and surprise.",
