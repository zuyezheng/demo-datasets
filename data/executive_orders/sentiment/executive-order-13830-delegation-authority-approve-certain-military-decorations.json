    "critique": "The document primarily outlines the criteria and procedures for awarding military decorations. It is a formal and legalistic document. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The emotions that might be present are very mild. Joy might be present due to the recognition of heroism, but it's not the primary focus. Sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be conveyed.",
