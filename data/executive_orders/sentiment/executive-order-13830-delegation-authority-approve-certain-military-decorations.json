The primary emotion it aims to evoke is a sense of respect and gratitude for the service and heroism of military personnel. It also aims to instill confidence in the fairness and consistency of the award process. There might be a slight element of joy associated with recognizing valor, but it's not the primary focus. There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a relevant emotion in this context.",
