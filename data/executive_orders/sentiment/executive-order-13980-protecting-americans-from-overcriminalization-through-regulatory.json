    "critique": "The document is a presidential order focused on regulatory transparency and fairness in criminal law. The primary goal is to ensure that Americans understand what is prohibited and to alleviate regulatory burdens. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision. There's a focus on protecting Americans from unwarranted criminal punishment for unintentional violations. The document does not convey strong emotions. It is mostly informative and procedural. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
