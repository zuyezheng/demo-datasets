    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that revokes a previous order and opens up land for homesteading. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight joy for ex-service men who can now claim land, but it's not a strong emotion. There might be a slight surprise that such an order exists, but again, it's minimal. Other emotions are not relevant.",
