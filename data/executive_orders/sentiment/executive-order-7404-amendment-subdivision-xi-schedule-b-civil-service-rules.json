It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The order is about authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to make employment decisions in specific areas. Therefore, the expected emotion scores should be very low across all emotions. The initial scores will be set to zero, and the revised scores will remain zero after the critique.",
