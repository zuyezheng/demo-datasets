    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the denial of an exemption application related to the Artificial Flower and Feather Industry. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, with no indication of strong emotion. The president is conveying a sense of authority and finality, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or resolve, but even that is not strongly conveyed. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for resolve.",
