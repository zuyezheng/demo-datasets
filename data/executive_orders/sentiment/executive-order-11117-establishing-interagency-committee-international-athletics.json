    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an Interagency Committee on International Athletics. It expresses the importance of international amateur athletic competitions and the need for the Department of State to have advice and assistance in this area. The language is formal and bureaucratic. Considering the content, context, and language, the emotions conveyed are minimal. There is a slight sense of joy due to the encouragement of international goodwill and physical welfare, but it's not strong. There's no significant sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
