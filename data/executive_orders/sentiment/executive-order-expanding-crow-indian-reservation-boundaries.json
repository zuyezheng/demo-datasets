    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Crow tribe. It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of joy for the Crow tribe, but it's not explicitly stated. Other emotions like sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not evident in the text. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions except joy, which will be slightly higher but still low.",
