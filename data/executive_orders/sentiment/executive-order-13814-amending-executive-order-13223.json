It invokes legal authorities and amends a previous order related to national emergency powers. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke joy. It implicitly aims to evoke fear to justify the order. It could evoke sadness in those who remember the events of 9/11. It could evoke surprise in those who are unaware of the continuing state of emergency. It does not explicitly aim to evoke disgust.",
