    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order primarily deals with administrative updates, such as quorum requirements and expiration dates. The inclusion of section 3(c) suggests a desire to avoid legal challenges, which might subtly convey caution or concern, but this is very mild. Therefore, the scores should be very low across all emotions.",
