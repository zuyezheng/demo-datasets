    "critique": "The document is a legal declaration regarding land transfer to be included in the Nantahala National Forest. The language is formal and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a base score of 1 for all emotions initially, as the document does not inherently evoke any strong feelings. Upon further reflection, the public might feel a slight sense of joy that land is being preserved for national forest purposes. Therefore, I will increase the joy score slightly.",
