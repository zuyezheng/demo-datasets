    "critique": "The executive order primarily focuses on defining the design of the President's Coat of Arms, Seal, Color, and Flag. It is a formal and descriptive document with the purpose of establishing and standardizing these symbols. There is a sense of pride and tradition, but the order does not explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. The order may evoke a very mild sense of joy and surprise in the reader. The order does not try to evoke sadness, fear, or disgust.",
