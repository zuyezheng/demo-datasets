The language is descriptive and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering this is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions to reflect the minimal emotional presence inherent in such documents. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
