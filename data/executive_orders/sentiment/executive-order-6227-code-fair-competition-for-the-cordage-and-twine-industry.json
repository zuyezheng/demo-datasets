It's about implementing regulations and setting deadlines, so there might be a slight sense of hope or optimism (joy) that things are moving forward. There's also a hint of seriousness and perhaps a touch of concern (fear) if the industry doesn't comply. Disgust, sadness, and surprise don't seem to be primary emotions the order is trying to evoke.",
