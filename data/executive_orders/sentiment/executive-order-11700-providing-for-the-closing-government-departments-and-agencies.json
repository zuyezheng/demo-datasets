    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order to close government offices as a mark of respect for Lyndon Baines Johnson. It expresses sadness due to the passing of a former president, but it is primarily a formal announcement. Therefore, the sadness score should be moderate. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, so these scores should be low.",
