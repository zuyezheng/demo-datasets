    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the establishment of a board to investigate a dispute. It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a subtle sense of reassurance or relief might be intended, suggesting that the situation is being handled and interstate commerce will be protected. I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the rest.",
