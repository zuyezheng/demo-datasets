    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It revokes a prior order and directs agencies to rescind related policies. The language is legal and procedural. There is no explicit emotional expression. However, the act of revoking an order could imply a sense of decisiveness or perhaps a desire to correct a perceived inefficiency. Given the formal nature, the emotional intensity is likely low across all categories. Considering the context, a slight degree of decisiveness might be interpreted as a low level of joy (in the sense of satisfaction with taking action) or a low level of anger (in the sense of correcting a wrong). However, these are very subtle and could easily be interpreted as neutral. I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions and then slightly adjust based on the potential for interpretation.",
