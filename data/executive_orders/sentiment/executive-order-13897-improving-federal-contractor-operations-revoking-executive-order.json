    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It revokes a prior order related to federal contractors. The language is legal and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the act of revoking an order could be interpreted as a sign of disgust or dissatisfaction with the previous policy, or perhaps a desire to surprise the contractors. The intensity of these emotions is likely to be low, as the document is primarily focused on legal and administrative matters. Therefore, I will assign low scores to disgust and surprise, and a score of 1 to the other emotions.",
