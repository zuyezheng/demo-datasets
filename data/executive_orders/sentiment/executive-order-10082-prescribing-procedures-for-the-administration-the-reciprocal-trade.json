    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding trade agreements. It establishes committees, outlines procedures for negotiating and administering trade agreements, and addresses potential issues like injury to domestic industries. The language is legalistic and procedural, with a focus on organization, analysis, and compliance. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the document conveys a sense of seriousness and purpose, aiming to promote and safeguard American economic interests. Given the nature of the document, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal. Most people would likely not have a strong emotional reaction to this type of document. Therefore, all initial scores are set to 1.",
