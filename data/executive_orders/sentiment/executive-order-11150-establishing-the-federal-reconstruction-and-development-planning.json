    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of hope and reassurance in the face of disaster. It acknowledges the tragedy but focuses on reconstruction and cooperation between federal and state entities. Therefore, the primary emotion should be joy (relief, hope), with a secondary element of surprise at the scale of the response. There might be a very mild sense of sadness lingering from the initial disaster, but the overall tone is forward-looking and positive. Disgust, fear, and anger are not intended emotions.",
