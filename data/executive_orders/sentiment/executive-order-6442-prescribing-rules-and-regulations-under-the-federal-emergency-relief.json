    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and hope, with a touch of seriousness. It outlines a plan for efficient relief distribution, which could inspire joy and reduce fear. However, the language is formal and bureaucratic, so the emotional impact might be limited. Initial assessment: Joy: 4, Fear: 3, Sadness: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Upon further reflection, the primary goal seems to be to instill confidence and reduce anxiety, so I'll adjust the scores accordingly.",
