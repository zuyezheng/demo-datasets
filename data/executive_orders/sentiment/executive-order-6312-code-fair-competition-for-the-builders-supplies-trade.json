    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Builders Supplies Trade. The language is legal and bureaucratic, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and formality. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal. I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for surprise due to the unexpected nature of the announcement.",
