    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the closure of federal government departments and agencies on December 26, 2014. It invokes the authority of the President and cites relevant legal provisions. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the order could be interpreted as conveying a sense of joy or goodwill by giving federal employees a day off after Christmas. However, this is not explicitly stated, so a low score is appropriate. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, these emotions should be scored as 1.",
