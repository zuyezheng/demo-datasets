The likely intended emotional response is neutral, perhaps with a slight sense of reassurance that the government is functioning and updating its processes. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all initial scores are set to 1, indicating a very low level of each emotion.",
