    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a commitment to supporting Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The language is formal and policy-oriented. There is a sense of optimism and purpose, but emotions are generally muted to maintain a professional tone. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be scored low, with joy being slightly higher due to the positive outlook.",
