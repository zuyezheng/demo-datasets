    "critique": "The executive order regarding land use in Alaska seems to be a routine administrative action. It modifies a previous order to allow the Department of Commerce to use certain townsite lots for aviation-field purposes. There's no indication of an intention to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is factual and procedural in nature.",
