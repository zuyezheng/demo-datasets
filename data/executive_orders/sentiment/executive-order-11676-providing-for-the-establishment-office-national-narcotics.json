    "critique": "The executive order aims to instill a sense of confidence and determination in addressing drug abuse. While it doesn't explicitly evoke strong emotions, it subtly conveys a sense of hope and resolve. The initial scores reflect this, with joy and surprise being slightly elevated to represent the positive impact of the order. However, upon further consideration, the primary goal is to convey a sense of seriousness and determination, so I will adjust the scores to reflect that.",
