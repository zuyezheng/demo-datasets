    "critique": "The document expresses determination and resolve in addressing drug abuse. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of firm resolve and determination to tackle a problem. The language is formal and official, aiming to inspire confidence and seriousness rather than strong emotional reactions. Therefore, the scores for joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be relatively low, reflecting the document's focus on policy and action rather than emotional appeals.",
