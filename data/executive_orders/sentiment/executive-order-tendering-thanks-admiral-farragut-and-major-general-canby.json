The primary emotion conveyed is joy, with a sense of national pride and accomplishment. There might be a slight element of surprise at the brilliant success, but the main focus is on positive emotions.The initial scores reflect these observations, with joy being the highest, followed by surprise. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context and are scored as 1.The revised scores maintain the emphasis on joy but slightly reduce the surprise score to reflect the overall tone of gratitude and appreciation.",
