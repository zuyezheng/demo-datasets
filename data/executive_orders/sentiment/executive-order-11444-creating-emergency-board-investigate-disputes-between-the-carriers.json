The primary intended emotional response is a sense of stability and order, perhaps a mild sense of reassurance that the situation is being handled. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the sudden intervention, but it shouldn't be a dominant emotion.",
