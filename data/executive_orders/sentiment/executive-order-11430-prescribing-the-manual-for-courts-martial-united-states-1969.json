    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, authority, and legal precision. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to establish a clear legal framework and ensure a smooth transition between different versions of the Manual for Courts-Martial. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low.",
