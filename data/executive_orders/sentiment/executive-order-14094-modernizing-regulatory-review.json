    "critique": "The executive order is primarily focused on modernizing the regulatory process and promoting public participation. It aims to create a more efficient, inclusive, and transparent system. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. However, a sense of optimism and confidence in the government's ability to improve regulatory processes might be subtly conveyed. There might be a slight sense of relief that the government is addressing these issues. Therefore, I will score joy as 3 and surprise as 2. All other emotions are 1.",
