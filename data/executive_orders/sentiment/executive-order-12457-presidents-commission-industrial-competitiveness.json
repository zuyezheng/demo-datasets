It amends a previous executive order to increase the membership and extend the life of the President's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no indication of any strong emotion being conveyed. The emotions that could be inferred are very low. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions.",
