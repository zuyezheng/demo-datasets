    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of Iranian government assets. It invokes legal authorities and describes specific actions to be taken. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. However, depending on their political views, some people may feel joy or anger about the order. Given the lack of emotional language, I will assign a low score to all emotions. After further consideration, I will revise the scores to reflect a slightly higher level of potential anger or joy depending on the reader's political views.",
