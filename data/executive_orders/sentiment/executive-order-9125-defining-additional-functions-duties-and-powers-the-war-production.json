The primary goal is to convey a sense of authority, control, and decisive action to ensure the effective prosecution of the war. While not explicitly designed to evoke emotions, the order aims to instill confidence and perhaps a sense of security through the demonstration of governmental efficiency. It could also cause fear in those who don't comply. Initial scores: Joy: 0, Sadness: 0, Anger: 0, Fear: 3, Disgust: 0, Surprise: 1.
