    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal delegation of power, and it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is transferring powers related to critical defense housing areas to the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Defense Mobilization. It is unlikely to make people feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are all set to 1, indicating a very low level of emotional response. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The revised scores remain the same.",
