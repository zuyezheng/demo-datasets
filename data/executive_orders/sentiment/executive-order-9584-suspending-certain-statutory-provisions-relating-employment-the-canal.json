    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document. It suspends compliance with certain sections of appropriation acts during ongoing wars. The language is formal and factual, and the purpose seems to be administrative. Therefore, it is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such an order is necessary, but even that is unlikely to be strong.",
