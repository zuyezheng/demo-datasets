    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of assurance and conservation rather than strong emotional responses. Joy might be present due to the preservation of wildlife, but it's not the primary goal. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely as the order is a formal declaration. The revised scores reflect a slightly increased sense of joy due to the positive impact on wildlife.",
