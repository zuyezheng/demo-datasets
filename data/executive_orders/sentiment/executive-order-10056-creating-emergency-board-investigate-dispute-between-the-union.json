The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is acting in an official capacity to address a potential disruption to interstate commerce. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal, with perhaps a slight sense of relief that the situation is being addressed. Given the lack of emotional content, all initial scores are set to 1.",
