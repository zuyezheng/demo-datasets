    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of relief and satisfaction by removing potentially unfair penalties. It seeks to reassure people that their land titles are secure and that they will not face undue hardship. The order eliminates forfeiture provisions related to activities like selling alcohol or gambling, suggesting a move towards leniency and fairness. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with a secondary emotion of surprise at the change in policy.",
