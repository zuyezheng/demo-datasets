    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Mescalero Apaches. It primarily uses neutral and legal language. There is a slight sense of care in providing land for the Apaches, but overall, the tone is objective and administrative. Therefore, emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are minimal. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values across all emotions. After further consideration, I will adjust the surprise score to 2, as the cancellation of the previous order and the establishment of a new one might carry a slight element of surprise.",
