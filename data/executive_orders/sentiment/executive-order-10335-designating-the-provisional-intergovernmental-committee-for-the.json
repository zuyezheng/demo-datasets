    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the Provisional Intergovernmental Committee for the Movement of Migrants from Europe as a public international organization. It cites the legal basis for this designation and includes standard closing elements like the President's name, the location (The White House), and the date. The language is formal and legalistic, devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, as the document aims to convey official action rather than personal sentiment. Since there isn't enough information to portray any emotion, I will assign a score of 1 to all the emotions.",
