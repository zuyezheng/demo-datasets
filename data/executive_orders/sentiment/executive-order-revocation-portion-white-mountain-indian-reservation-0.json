    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a dry, legal description of land being restored to the public domain. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores are all 1. After further consideration, I realized that there might be a slight sense of sadness or disgust depending on one's perspective on the historical treatment of Native American land. Therefore, I will adjust the sadness and disgust scores to 2.",
