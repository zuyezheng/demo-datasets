    "critique": "The document is an executive order delegating authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to provide assistance to Indian tribes facing economic distress due to natural disasters. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit expression of emotion. However, the order implicitly conveys a sense of concern for the well-being of the affected tribes. I will score the emotions based on this implicit concern and the potential impact of the order on the public.",
