    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing two councils focused on integrity, efficiency, and preventing fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal programs. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the underlying intent to improve government operations and address negative issues like fraud and waste suggests a subtle concern and a desire for positive change. Therefore, I will assign low scores to sadness (related to the problems being addressed), and a slightly higher score to joy (related to the intended positive outcomes). Fear, disgust, and surprise are not directly expressed, so they will receive low scores. I will revise the scores to reflect the subtle emotions related to the document's purpose.",
