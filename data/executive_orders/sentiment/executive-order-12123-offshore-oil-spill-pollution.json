    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document assigning responsibilities related to environmental protection from oil spills. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and delegate authority, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values. Upon further consideration, the order might instill a slight sense of reassurance or relief that measures are being taken to protect the environment, so I'll adjust the joy score slightly upwards. There's also a very mild potential for surprise that such a detailed order is necessary, so I'll give surprise a minimal score.",
