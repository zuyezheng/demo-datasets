    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of purpose and determination to reform the civil service hiring process. The President aims to instill confidence in the merit-based system and promote inclusivity. There's a subtle undercurrent of dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs, but it's framed as a need for modernization rather than outright anger or disgust. The language is formal and policy-oriented, which tempers strong emotional expression. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise are not expected to be conveyed.",
