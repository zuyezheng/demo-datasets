    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of progress and improvement in government hiring practices. It seeks to instill confidence in the merit-based system and promote a feeling of opportunity for a wider range of job seekers. The order also intends to convey a sense of modernization and efficiency in government operations. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with secondary emotions of surprise at the changes and perhaps a touch of reduced sadness from those who felt excluded by the old system. There is no intention to convey fear, disgust, or anger.",
