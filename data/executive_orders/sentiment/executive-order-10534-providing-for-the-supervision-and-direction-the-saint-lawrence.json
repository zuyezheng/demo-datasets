    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The most relevant emotions might be surprise (due to the unexpected nature of the order) and perhaps a slight degree of fear or disgust if the public perceives the order as an overreach of power. However, these emotions are likely to be weak. Joy and sadness are unlikely to be conveyed.",
