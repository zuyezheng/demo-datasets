    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding a labor dispute. It expresses concern about potential disruption to interstate commerce but maintains a neutral tone. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legalistic and objective, aiming to establish a board to investigate the dispute and prevent changes to the conditions that caused it. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the document's neutrality. After a second thought, I still believe the initial assessment is accurate, as the document's primary goal is to establish a legal framework for resolving the dispute rather than conveying any particular emotion.",
