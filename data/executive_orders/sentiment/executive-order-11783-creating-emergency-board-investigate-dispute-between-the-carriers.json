    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute in the railway industry. It establishes a board to investigate the dispute and prevent disruption to interstate commerce. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the implicit emotions conveyed might be concern (to prevent disruption) and determination (to resolve the dispute). The scores are based on the assumption that the public might feel a low level of concern and a moderate level of surprise that the president is involved in this issue.",
