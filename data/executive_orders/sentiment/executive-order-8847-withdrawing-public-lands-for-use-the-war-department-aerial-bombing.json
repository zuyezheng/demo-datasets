The order withdraws land for military use, which might evoke a sense of security or, conversely, fear in some audiences. However, the primary emotion conveyed is likely a sense of seriousness and purpose. The order does not seem to evoke joy, sadness, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not the main emotion.",
