It addresses a dispute and establishes a board to investigate, suggesting a desire to resolve the issue peacefully and maintain essential transportation services. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed would be a mild sense of reassurance or perhaps a slight sense of surprise that action is being taken. There isn't a strong emphasis on joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
