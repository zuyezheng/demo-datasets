    "critique": "The executive order is about closing Federal Government departments and agencies for half a day on Christmas Eve. This is likely to evoke a sense of joy and surprise, as people may be happy to have extra time off during the holidays. There might be a slight sense of sadness for those who have to work, but overall, the dominant emotions should be joy and surprise. Disgust, fear, and anger are unlikely to be conveyed by this order.",
