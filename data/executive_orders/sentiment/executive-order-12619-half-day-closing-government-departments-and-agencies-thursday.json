    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the closure of Federal Government departments and agencies on Christmas Eve. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the act of giving employees time off for Christmas Eve could be interpreted as conveying a sense of joy or goodwill. Considering the context, the public might feel a slight sense of joy or gratitude. The other emotions are not relevant in this context, so they should be scored as 1.",
