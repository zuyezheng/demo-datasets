    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to instill a sense of seriousness and perhaps a touch of fear or concern due to the censorship measures being implemented during a time of potential crisis. There's no indication of joy. Sadness might be a byproduct for those who value freedom of communication. Surprise is possible, depending on how sudden this order feels to the public. Disgust is unlikely, unless someone is strongly against censorship.",
