    "critique": "The document primarily expresses a neutral sentiment. It's a formal announcement about appointments, lacking strong emotional cues. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. Upon review, the Acting Secretary of Treasury recommending the order might suggest a slight positive sentiment, but it's still very subtle. The final scores should reflect this neutrality with a slight increase in joy.",
