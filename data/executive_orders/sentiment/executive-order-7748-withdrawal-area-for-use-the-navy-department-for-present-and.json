    "critique": "The executive order regarding Alaska seems to be a very formal and legal document. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about land withdrawal for naval purposes, which might bring a slight sense of security (less fear) or perhaps a little surprise that such orders exist. However, the overall emotional impact is minimal. Thus, I will score all emotions very low initially. After further consideration, I realize that for people living in the affected area, this might cause some level of sadness or fear. Therefore, I will revise the sadness and fear scores slightly upwards.",
