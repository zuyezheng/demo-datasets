    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing the American Heritage Rivers Initiative Advisory Committee. The language is formal and legalistic. The purpose is to create a committee to review and recommend rivers for designation as American Heritage Rivers. The document does not express any strong emotions. The president is trying to portray a sense of importance and authority. The public is expected to feel a sense of civic duty and pride in the nation's natural resources. The document is not intended to evoke strong emotions, so the scores should be low.",
