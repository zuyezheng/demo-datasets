It clarifies the definition of noncombatant service and training for conscientious objectors, potentially reducing fear and anxiety among those affected. There might be a slight element of joy for those who benefit from these provisions, but it's not a primary emotion. Sadness, disgust, and surprise are unlikely to be intended emotions.",
