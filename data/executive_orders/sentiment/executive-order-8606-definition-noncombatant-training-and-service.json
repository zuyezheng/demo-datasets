    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of neutrality and legal formality. It outlines the definition of noncombatant service and training for conscientious objectors. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and objective, aiming to clarify the policy regarding conscientious objectors during the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be relatively low, reflecting the document's neutral tone.",
