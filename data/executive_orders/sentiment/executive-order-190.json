    "critique": "The document is a formal order to close Executive Departments and the Government Printing Office for Memorial Day. The primary emotion conveyed is respect and solemn remembrance of soldiers and sailors who died in the Civil War. There is a sense of sadness for the loss of life, but it is presented in a formal and respectful manner. There isn't enough information to score joy, surprise, disgust, or fear, so I will default to a score of 1 for those.",
