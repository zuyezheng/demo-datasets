    "critique": "The executive order is about honoring soldiers and sailors who died in the Civil War. The primary emotion the president wants to convey is sadness, with a secondary emotion of joy in remembering their sacrifice. There might also be a hint of surprise that the president is giving a day off for this purpose. Disgust, fear, and anger are not relevant emotions in this context.The initial scores seem appropriate, but I will slightly increase the sadness score to reflect the solemn nature of the order.",
