Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are joy (related to progress and improvement) and trust (related to responsible use and protection of values). There might be a slight element of surprise related to the innovative nature of AI, but it's not a primary emotion. There is no intention to convey sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
