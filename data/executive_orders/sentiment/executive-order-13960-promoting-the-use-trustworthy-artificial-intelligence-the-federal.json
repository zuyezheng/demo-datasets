    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the use of AI in government. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of optimism and purpose regarding the potential benefits of AI, but also caution and responsibility in its implementation. There is a clear emphasis on ensuring AI is used ethically and in accordance with American values. Given the formal nature, strong emotions are unlikely. Joy is present due to the positive outlook on AI's potential, but it's tempered. Sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are less prominent, but there's a hint of fear regarding the potential misuse of AI, hence a slightly elevated score. Surprise is minimal as the document is more about structured implementation than unexpected breakthroughs.",
