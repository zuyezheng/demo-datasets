The order is about land allocation, specifically for ex-service men of the war with Germany. There might be a slight sense of joy for those who benefit from this order, but it's not explicitly designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, I will score all emotions as 1, indicating a very minimal level of conveyance.",
