    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential statement regarding waiving certain trade restrictions with Armenia. It invokes legal and constitutional authority, referencing specific sections of the Trade Act of 1974. The language is formal and legalistic, devoid of emotional expression. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1 due to lack of information.",
