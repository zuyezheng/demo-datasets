    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that waives certain trade restrictions with Armenia. The language is legal and technical, and the purpose is to enact a specific policy change. Therefore, the primary emotions the president wants to convey are neutral. There may be a slight sense of Joy and Surprise that trade restrictions are being lifted, but these emotions are very mild.",
