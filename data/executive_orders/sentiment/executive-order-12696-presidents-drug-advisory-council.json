    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Drug Advisory Council. It outlines the council's functions, administration, and general provisions. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional tone. However, the underlying intent is to address the issue of drug control, which can be associated with negative emotions like fear and disgust related to drug use, and hope/joy that the problem is being addressed. The order itself doesn't express these emotions directly, but the context implies them. Therefore, the initial scores will reflect the implied emotions, with low scores for emotions not directly related to the document's purpose.",
