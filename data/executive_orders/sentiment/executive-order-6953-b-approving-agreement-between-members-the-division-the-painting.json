Therefore, it doesn't strongly evoke any particular emotion. However, there might be a slight sense of reassurance or relief (a mild form of joy) that things are being handled correctly and that the government is working to improve the construction industry. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
