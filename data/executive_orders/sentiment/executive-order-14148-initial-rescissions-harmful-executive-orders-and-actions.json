    "critique": "The document expresses anger and disgust towards the previous administration's policies, particularly regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), border security, and climate change. It conveys a sense of joy and hope in restoring common sense and unleashing the potential of the American citizen. There is a sense of fear regarding the perceived dangers of the previous administration's policies. Surprise is minimal, as the document primarily focuses on reversing existing policies rather than introducing unexpected changes. I will revise the scores to reflect these observations.",
