    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order, progress, and national unity. It uses formal language and emphasizes compliance with the National Industrial Recovery Act, suggesting a desire to instill confidence and optimism. The order does not seem to want the audience to feel sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. However, there might be a slight element of surprise due to the formal announcement. The primary emotion is joy because it is about fair competition.",
