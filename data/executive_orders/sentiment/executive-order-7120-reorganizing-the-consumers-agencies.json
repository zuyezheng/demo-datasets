    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily establishes and defines the roles and responsibilities related to consumer protection and economic recovery during the Depression era. The language is legalistic and administrative, with little emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of hope or optimism (joy) related to improving the American standard of living, but it's very subdued. There is no explicit sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed.",
