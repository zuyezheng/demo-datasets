    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the establishment and function of a Consumers' Division within the National Recovery Administration. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the creation of a Consumers' Division and the focus on promoting a better standard of living could be interpreted as conveying a sense of hope or optimism (joy) and perhaps a desire to alleviate hardship (sadness). The intensity of these emotions is likely to be low, as the document is primarily administrative in nature. There is no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
