    "critique": "The document expresses a tone of authority, responsibility, and benevolence. It aims to convey a sense of security and hope to the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands while also asserting the dominance of the United States.The primary emotions conveyed are joy (at the victory and new possibilities), and a lack of fear, disgust, sadness and surprise. The text does not explicitly evoke fear, disgust, sadness or surprise, so those scores should be low. The joy score reflects the optimism and opportunity presented by the new governance.",
