It outlines the modification of a previous order, specifies the location of confinement, and directs the transportation and confinement of the prisoners. There is no explicit expression of emotion in the text. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on directives and procedures. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be neutral, with low scores for all emotions. Initial scores: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 1.
