    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative update, reassigning two assistants to the Secretary in the office of the Secretary of Agriculture. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such a specific detail is being addressed at this level, but even that is minimal. Therefore, I will score all emotions very low initially.",
