    "critique": "The executive order is primarily focused on establishing rules and regulations for the civil service. The language is formal and bureaucratic, aiming to convey a sense of order, fairness, and efficiency. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The goal is to instill confidence in the system and ensure a merit-based approach to government appointments. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be very low.",
