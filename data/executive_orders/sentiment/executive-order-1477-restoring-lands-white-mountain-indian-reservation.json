    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land boundaries and the restoration of the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation. It uses formal language and aims to be precise and objective. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The purpose is to restore the reservation to its previous status, which could be seen as a positive action, but the document itself doesn't convey joy. Similarly, while the exclusion might address a past issue, the document doesn't express sadness or regret. Given the formal and objective nature, the initial scores for all emotions should be low.",
