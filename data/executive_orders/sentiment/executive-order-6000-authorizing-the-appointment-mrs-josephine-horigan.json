    "critique": "The executive order seems to convey a sense of joy and surprise. The joy comes from the fact that Mrs. Horigan is being appointed to a position in the Department of Agriculture. The surprise comes from the fact that she is being appointed without regard to the civil-service rules. However, the order also conveys a sense of sadness. The sadness comes from the fact that Mrs. Horigan is the widow of James B. Horigan, who for nearly 23 years was employed in the Government service in the Solicitor's Office of the Department of Agriculture. The order does not seem to convey any sense of anger, fear, or disgust.",
