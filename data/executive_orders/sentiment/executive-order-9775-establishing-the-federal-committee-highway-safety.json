    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding highway safety. It establishes a committee and outlines its responsibilities. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no strong emotional sentiment conveyed. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such an order was issued, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions.",
