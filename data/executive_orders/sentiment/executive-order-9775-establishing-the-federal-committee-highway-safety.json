    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Federal Committee on Highway Safety. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the order implicitly conveys a sense of concern about highway safety, which can be interpreted as a low level of fear and sadness related to accidents. There is also a hint of joy that comes from the prospect of improving highway safety. Surprise and disgust are not relevant in this context. Given the formal nature, the emotional scores should be low.",
