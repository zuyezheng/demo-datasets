    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order related to land withdrawal and reservation for the Jemez Pueblo Indians. It uses formal and legal language. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary purpose is to amend a previous order and define the land boundaries for the reservation. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be low, close to 1, as the document is factual and administrative in nature.",
