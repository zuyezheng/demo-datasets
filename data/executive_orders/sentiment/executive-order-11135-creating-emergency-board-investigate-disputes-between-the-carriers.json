    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document addressing a labor dispute. The primary goal is to communicate the establishment of a board to investigate the dispute and prevent disruption to interstate commerce. The intended emotional response is likely a sense of calm and assurance that the situation is being handled responsibly. Therefore, I would expect a low score for negative emotions and a slightly higher score for positive emotions like joy or surprise that the government is taking action.",
