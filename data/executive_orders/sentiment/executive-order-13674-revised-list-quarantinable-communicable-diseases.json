    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that amends a previous executive order. The language is formal and technical. The order itself deals with severe acute respiratory syndromes. The order does not try to evoke any particular emotion. However, the topic of the order, respiratory syndromes, might cause some fear. The order itself aims to prevent the spread of disease, so it could also be interpreted as promoting joy by preventing people from getting sick. However, the primary goal is not to evoke emotion, so all scores should be low.",
