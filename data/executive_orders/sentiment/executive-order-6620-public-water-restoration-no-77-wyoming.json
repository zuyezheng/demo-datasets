    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry legal document. The order revokes a previous order pertaining to land in Wyoming. It does not seem to want to evoke any strong emotions. The strongest emotion might be surprise that such an order exists, but that would be very mild. The initial scores will be very low across the board. After further consideration, the order is unlikely to evoke any emotions, so all scores should be 1.",
