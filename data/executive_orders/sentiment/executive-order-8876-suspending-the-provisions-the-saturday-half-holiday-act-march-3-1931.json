    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of serious resolve and national urgency rather than trying to evoke specific emotions. It's a legal document detailing the suspension of certain provisions to aid national defense during a declared emergency. Therefore, the primary emotion it might subtly aim for is a sense of reassurance (low-level joy) that the government is taking necessary actions, but mostly it should inspire a sense of duty and acceptance. There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should reflect this, with a very low score for joy and zero for the other emotions. Upon revision, I'll keep the joy score low but present, and the rest at zero.",
