    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining emergency preparedness measures for civil aviation. The primary emotion it aims to convey is a sense of preparedness and seriousness, which can be associated with a low level of fear and surprise, but not joy, sadness, or disgust. The order is about readiness for a potential attack or national emergency, so it evokes a sense of caution and the need to be prepared. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores are slightly adjusted to better reflect the intent.",
