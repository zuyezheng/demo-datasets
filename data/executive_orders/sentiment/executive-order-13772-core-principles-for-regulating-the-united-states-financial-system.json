    "critique": "The executive order aims to instill confidence and optimism. It focuses on empowering Americans, preventing bailouts, fostering economic growth, and promoting accountability. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with a secondary emphasis on trust and perhaps a mild sense of relief (reducing fear). There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, disgust, or strong surprise. The order is written in a formal, policy-oriented tone, minimizing emotional expression.",
