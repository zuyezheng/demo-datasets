    "critique": "The executive order seems to be conveying a sense of finality and authority. It is unlikely to evoke joy or surprise. It might evoke sadness in some, disgust and anger in others, and fear in others. The order is likely to evoke sadness in those who feel a sense of loss or injustice due to the change in land status. It might evoke disgust and anger in those who disapprove of the action and fear in those who are concerned about the consequences of the order.",
