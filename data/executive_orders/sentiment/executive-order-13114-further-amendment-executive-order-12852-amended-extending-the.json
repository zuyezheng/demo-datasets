    "critique": "The executive order is a technical amendment to a previous order, extending the life of the President's Council on Sustainable Development. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of relief or satisfaction for those interested in sustainable development, but this would be very mild. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be scored very low.",
