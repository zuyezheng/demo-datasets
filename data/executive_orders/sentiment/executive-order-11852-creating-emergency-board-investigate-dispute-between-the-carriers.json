    "critique": "The document describes a labor dispute and the creation of a board to investigate it. The language is formal and legalistic, with no strong emotional indicators. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be neutral. Initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions due to the lack of emotional content. Upon review, the initial scores accurately reflect the neutral tone and lack of overt emotional expression in the document. No revisions are necessary.",
