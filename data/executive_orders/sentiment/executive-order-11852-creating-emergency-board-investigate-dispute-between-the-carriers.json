    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the creation of a board to investigate a dispute between railway carriers and their employees. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of concern and urgency is present due to the potential disruption of interstate commerce. Therefore, I will assign low scores to sadness, fear, and surprise, and a minimal score to disgust. Joy is not present. The initial scores reflect this assessment. After further consideration, I will revise the scores to slightly increase the fear and sadness scores to reflect the potential negative impact of the dispute.",
