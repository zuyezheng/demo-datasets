    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the termination of the Office of Inter-American Affairs and the transfer of its functions and assets to the Secretary of State and the Department of State. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Most people would not have a strong reaction. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the initial assessment seems accurate. The document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any significant emotional response from the public.",
