    "critique": "The executive order cancels a previous order that set aside land for a Native American reservation and returns the land to the public domain. This would likely evoke sadness and anger from those who supported the reservation, and perhaps joy from those who opposed it. The order itself is written in a neutral, legalistic tone, so it doesn't explicitly aim to evoke any particular emotion. However, considering the likely emotional impact on different groups, I will score sadness and anger higher than joy, and I will include a small amount of surprise. Revised scores will reflect a more nuanced understanding of the emotional impact.",
