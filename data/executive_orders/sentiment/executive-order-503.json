The most relevant emotions might be sadness (for those losing land) or joy (for those gaining access), but the overall impact is likely to be minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values for all emotions. The revised scores are similar, with a slight increase in sadness and joy to acknowledge the potential emotional impact on different groups.",
