The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment in implementing the National Industrial Recovery Act. Therefore, the expected emotions from the public would be minimal. I will assign low scores across all emotions initially, and then revise based on the context of the Great Depression, where such actions might inspire a little joy and reduce fear.",
