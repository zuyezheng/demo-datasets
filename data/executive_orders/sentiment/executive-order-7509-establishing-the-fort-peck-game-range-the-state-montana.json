The primary goal is to convey a sense of order, authority, and commitment to conservation. Therefore, the emotions to be conveyed are joy (in the sense of satisfaction that natural resources are being protected) and perhaps a touch of surprise (at the scale of the project). There is no intention to convey sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
