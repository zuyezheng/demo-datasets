    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Fort Peck Game Range. The primary emotions conveyed are related to conservation and resource management. There is a sense of joy in protecting wildlife and natural resources, but it is subdued. There is no explicit sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise expressed in the document. The language is formal and legalistic, which further reduces the emotional impact.",
