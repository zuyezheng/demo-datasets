    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement by President Roosevelt regarding the approval of a Compact of Fair Competition for Prison Industries. It outlines the legal basis for the action, appoints members to the Prison Labor Authority, and delegates power to the Administrator for Industrial Recovery. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the document conveys a sense of optimism (joy) that the compact will assist in effectuating the policies of the National Industrial Recovery Act. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
