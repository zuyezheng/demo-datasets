    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a determined and decisive tone, but avoids overt emotional displays. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of purpose and resolve in reducing the size of the Federal Government. There's a hint of dissatisfaction with the current state, but it's presented in a factual, non-emotional way. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions except for a slightly higher score for determination, which I will represent as a low level of anger/disgust towards government waste.",
