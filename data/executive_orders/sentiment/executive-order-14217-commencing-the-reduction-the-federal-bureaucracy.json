While not explicitly joyful, the order suggests a positive outcome of increased accountability and reduced waste, which could be interpreted as a subtle expression of joy or optimism. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or surprise. The language is formal and authoritative, aiming to inspire confidence in the President's actions.",
