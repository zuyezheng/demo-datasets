    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transportation of liquors through the Canal Zone. It's a legal and administrative document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotions, if any, might be mild surprise or perhaps a touch of disgust related to the subject matter (liquor during prohibition), but these would be very low intensity. Most people would likely feel nothing. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for surprise due to the specific nature of the order.",
