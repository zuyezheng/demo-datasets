    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and reassurance. It extends the service of an individual, which might evoke a mild sense of joy or relief. However, the primary emotions conveyed are likely to be low-intensity, as the order is more administrative in nature. The initial scores reflect this, with joy at 3 and other emotions at 1 or 2. After further consideration, I believe the order is primarily informational and doesn't strongly evoke any particular emotion. Therefore, I've revised the scores to be even lower, with joy at 2 and all other emotions at 1.",
