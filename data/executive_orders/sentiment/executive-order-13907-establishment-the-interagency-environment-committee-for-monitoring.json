    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an interagency committee. It is primarily concerned with legal and administrative matters related to environmental enforcement. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. There might be a slight sense of joy related to the positive impact of environmental protection, but it's very subtle. There's no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
