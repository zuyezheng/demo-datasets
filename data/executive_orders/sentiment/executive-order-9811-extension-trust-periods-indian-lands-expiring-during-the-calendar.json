    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending trust periods for Indian lands. It uses legal and bureaucratic language. There is no explicit expression of emotion. The primary goal appears to be to convey information and legal authority, not to evoke a particular emotion in the reader. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After reflection, the order could be interpreted as conveying a sense of responsibility or perhaps a subtle sense of hope for the future, but these are very mild. The revised scores will reflect this slight adjustment.",
