    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the facts of a labor dispute and establishing a board to investigate it. It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle undercurrent of concern or seriousness given the potential disruption to interstate commerce. The order seems to convey a sense of urgency and importance, but not necessarily fear. The initial scores will reflect a baseline of 1 for all emotions, with a slight increase in surprise to 2 to reflect the importance of the situation.",
