There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The situation involves a dispute that could disrupt transportation, suggesting a potential for concern, but this is not explicitly stated as fear. The document focuses on establishing a board to investigate and resolve the dispute in a neutral manner.",
