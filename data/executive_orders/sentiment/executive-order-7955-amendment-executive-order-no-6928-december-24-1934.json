    "critique": "The executive order is a technical document that removes Austria and the schilling from a list of countries and monetary units. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is effective September 1, 1938, and the computation of losses sustained by employees in service in the former state of Austria will be upon the basic rate for the German reichsmark. This may evoke sadness as Austria is a former state. However, the overall emotion is neutral.",
