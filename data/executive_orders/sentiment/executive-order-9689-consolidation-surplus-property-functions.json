    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining the transfer of functions and responsibilities related to surplus property disposal. It doesn't seem to aim to evoke strong emotions in the audience. However, there might be a slight sense of relief or satisfaction that the government is taking steps to efficiently manage surplus property after the war. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the rest.",
