    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action, extending an exemption from compulsory retirement for a specific individual. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The primary goal is to communicate a legal decision, not to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially.",
