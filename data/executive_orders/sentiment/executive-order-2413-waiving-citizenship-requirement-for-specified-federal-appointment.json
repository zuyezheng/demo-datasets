It highlights the candidate's qualifications and the support from relevant authorities. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with a moderate intensity. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the waiver of citizenship, but it's not a dominant emotion. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
