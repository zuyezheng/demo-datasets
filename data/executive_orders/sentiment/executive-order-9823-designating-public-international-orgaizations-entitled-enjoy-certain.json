    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of international organizations. It primarily conveys a neutral tone, with no strong emotions expressed. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Considering that there might be a slight sense of satisfaction or approval in formally recognizing these organizations, a minimal score is assigned to joy. All other emotions are set to 1 due to the lack of explicit emotional content.",
