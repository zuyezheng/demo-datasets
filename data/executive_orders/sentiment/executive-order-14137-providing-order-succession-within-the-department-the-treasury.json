The language is precise and does not convey any particular emotion. The order is meant to ensure the continuity of government in the event of vacancies in key positions. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal. Most people would likely not have a strong emotional reaction to this document. The initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions, as the document is not designed to evoke any specific emotion.",
