    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that aims to clarify and broaden the role of the Attorney General in enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, it could be argued that the order aims to promote fairness and equality, which might evoke a sense of joy or hope in some readers. Conversely, those who oppose the order or its goals might feel anger or disgust. The order itself is unlikely to evoke fear or surprise, as it is a relatively straightforward legal document.I will set joy to 3, and disgust to 2.",
