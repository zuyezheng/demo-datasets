    "critique": "The document is a proclamation about transferring part of the Dixie National Forest to the Nevada National Forest. It's a formal, administrative document. There is no explicit emotional language used. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially. Upon further reflection, the document's purpose is purely administrative, lacking any emotional cues. The initial scores accurately reflect this absence of emotional content, so no revision is needed.",
