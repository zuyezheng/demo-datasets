    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, focusing on addressing a labor dispute and ensuring the continuation of essential transportation services. It doesn't explicitly try to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle sense of reassurance or relief that the situation is being handled, but it's not a primary goal of the order. The initial scores reflect this neutrality, with low values across all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the order is primarily neutral, but there might be a slight sense of reassurance or hope that the situation will be resolved, so I've adjusted the joy score slightly upwards.",
