    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and stability. While it doesn't explicitly evoke strong emotions, there's a subtle undercurrent of joy that the individual is allowed to continue working. There is no explicit indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not the intention. The order is a very mundane one, so I will reduce the joy score.",
