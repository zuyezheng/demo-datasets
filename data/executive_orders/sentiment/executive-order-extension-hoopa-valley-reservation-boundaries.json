    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the extension of the Hoopa Valley Reservation. It's a legal and administrative document, so the primary emotions conveyed are neutral. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the act of extending the reservation might imply a sense of responsibility or concern for the welfare of the Native American population, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions.",
