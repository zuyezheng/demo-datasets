    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the consolidation of two national forests. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The language is legal and administrative, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. Upon review, this seems appropriate as the document is purely informational and procedural.",
