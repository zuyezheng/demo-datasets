    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment regarding the admission of deaf mutes to civil service examinations. It's a legal and administrative document, so strong emotions are unlikely. Joy might be present in a minimal sense due to the potential positive impact on deaf mutes, but it's not explicitly conveyed. Sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not evident in the text. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions except joy, which will be slightly higher but still low.",
