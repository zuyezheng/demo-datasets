It emphasizes loyalty and reliability, which could evoke a sense of joy and surprise that the government is taking measures to protect national security. However, it also introduces an element of fear and disgust towards those who might be disloyal or untrustworthy. Sadness might be conveyed due to the potential consequences for individuals who are deemed security risks.",
