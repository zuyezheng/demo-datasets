    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of justice, transparency, and resolution regarding the release of long-withheld information about the assassinations of prominent figures. While there's an underlying somber tone due to the subject matter, the order primarily seeks to instill a sense of trust and satisfaction that the government is finally addressing these historical events with openness. Therefore, joy and surprise are the most relevant emotions. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the emphasis on joy and reduce surprise, as the order is more about fulfilling a long-awaited action than presenting a sudden revelation.",
