    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a technical correction to align the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System with the Civil Service Retirement and Disability System. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. The order is purely administrative and legal in nature, with no apparent intention to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
