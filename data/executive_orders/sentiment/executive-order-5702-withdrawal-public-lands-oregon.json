    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that withdraws land from settlement to protect sea lions. The language is formal and factual. The order does not contain language that evokes emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The purpose of the order is to protect sea lions, which might evoke a small amount of joy in people who care about animals. The order itself is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions.",
