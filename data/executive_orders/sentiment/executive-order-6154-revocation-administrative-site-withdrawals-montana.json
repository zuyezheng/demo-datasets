    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that revokes previous executive orders and opens up land for homesteading by ex-service men. The order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. It is a factual statement of policy. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After revision, the scores should remain low, as the document's primary purpose is administrative rather than emotional.",
