    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily concerns the designation of the Secretary of Defense to coordinate actions related to the Federal Voting Assistance Act of 1955. The language is formal and legalistic, devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion to reflect this lack of emotional content. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
