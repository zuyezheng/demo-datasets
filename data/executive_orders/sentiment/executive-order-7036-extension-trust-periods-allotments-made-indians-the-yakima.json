    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document extending trust periods for land allotments to Native Americans. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to convey a sense of legal obligation and administrative action, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low. Revised scores should reflect this neutral stance.",
