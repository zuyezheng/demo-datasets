    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It amends a section of the Civil Service Rules to add a position to the Rural Electrification Administration. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of importance or formality, but overall, the emotional content is minimal. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions initially. After a second thought, I still believe that the emotional content is minimal, so the scores will remain low.",
