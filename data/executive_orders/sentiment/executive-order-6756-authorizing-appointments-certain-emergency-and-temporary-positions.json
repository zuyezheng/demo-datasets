    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about appointments and doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions. However, the mention of the Emergency Banking Act, Gold Reserve Act, and Silver Purchase Act might bring a sense of relief and hope (joy) to some, given the context of economic recovery during that time. There might also be a slight sense of surprise due to the waiving of civil service rules, but it's likely a minor emotion. Fear, disgust, and sadness don't seem to be relevant emotions conveyed by this order.",
