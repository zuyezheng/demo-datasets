    "critique": "The executive order is a technical document that amends a previous executive order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order changes \"seven consecutive days\" to \"thirty consecutive days\" in Executive Order No. 11157. This is a minor change that is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is signed by the president, but this is a formality. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low.",
