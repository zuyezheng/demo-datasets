    "critique": "The letter aims to foster reconciliation and unity. It suggests returning flags to promote healing and a sense of shared future rather than dwelling on past conflicts. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with a lesser degree of sadness for the past conflict. There is no intention to evoke fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of joy should be moderate, as the tone is formal and respectful.",
