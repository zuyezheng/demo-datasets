Disgust: There is no indication of disgust in the document (1). Surprise: The suggestion to return Confederate flags might be mildly surprising, but the overall tone is deliberate and thoughtful, so surprise is low (2). Revised assessment: Upon further reflection, the letter's primary aim is reconciliation and unity, downplaying strong emotions. The joy score should be slightly higher to reflect the hope for a glorious future. The sadness score should be adjusted slightly lower, as the focus is on moving past the conflict. The surprise score remains low, as the suggestion is presented as a logical step towards reconciliation.",
