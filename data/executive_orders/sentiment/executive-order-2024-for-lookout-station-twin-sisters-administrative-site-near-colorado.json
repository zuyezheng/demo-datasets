    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal declaration about land withdrawal for a specific purpose. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and instruct, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be very low. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily informational, there might be a very slight sense of reassurance or perhaps mild interest depending on the reader's connection to the described land or the Forest Service. However, these emotions would be minimal.",
