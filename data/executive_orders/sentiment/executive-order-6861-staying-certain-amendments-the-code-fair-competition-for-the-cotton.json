It addresses a specific issue (amendments to the Cotton Garment Industry code) and outlines a process for resolving disputes. There's no strong push for joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Instead, the goal is to convey fairness and order. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy to 2, sadness to 1, anger to 1, fear to 1, disgust to 1, and surprise to 2.",
