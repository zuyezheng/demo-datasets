It's a legal document, so the primary emotions conveyed would be related to the intent to protect or provide for a group. There is no explicit emotional language, so the scores should be relatively low. Joy could be present as a result of helping the Seminole Indians. Sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not evident in the document.",
