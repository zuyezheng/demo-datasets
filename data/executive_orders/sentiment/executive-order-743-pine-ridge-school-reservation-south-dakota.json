    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that amends a previous order regarding land allocation for Native American reservations. The language is formal and technical, focusing on geographical boundaries and legal descriptions. There is no explicit attempt to evoke emotions in the reader. The primary goal is to clarify and correct a conflict between two previous orders. Therefore, the appropriate scores for all emotions should be very low, as the document is not designed to elicit any emotional response.",
