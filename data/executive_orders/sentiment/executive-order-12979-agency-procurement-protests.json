    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and efficiency. There's a focus on resolving issues fairly and quickly, which might evoke a mild sense of joy or relief that things are being handled well. However, it's not a strong emotional piece. The order is more about procedure and policy than stirring emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across the board. After further consideration, I think the joy score should be slightly higher to reflect the positive outcome of fair and expeditious resolution of protests.",
