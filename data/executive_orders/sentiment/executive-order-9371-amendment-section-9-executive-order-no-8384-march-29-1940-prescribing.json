    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a technical amendment related to government employee leave. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a slight sense of relief or satisfaction for government employees who are affected by the statute expiration, but the intensity would likely be low. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the other emotions. After further consideration, the order seems more procedural, so I will revise all scores to zero.",
