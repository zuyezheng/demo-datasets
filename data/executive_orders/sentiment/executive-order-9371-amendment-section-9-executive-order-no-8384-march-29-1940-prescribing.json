    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily concerns administrative matters related to government employee leave. There is no strong emotional content. The most relevant emotions might be a mild sense of relief (joy) for employees who benefit from the extended leave options, and perhaps a touch of disappointment (sadness) for those whose positions are terminated. However, these are very subtle. Fear, disgust, and surprise are not relevant in this context. I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for sadness and joy.",
