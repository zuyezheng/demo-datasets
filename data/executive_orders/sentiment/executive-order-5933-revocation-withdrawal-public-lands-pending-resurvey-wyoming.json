    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land use. It revokes a previous order and opens the land for homesteading by ex-service men and then the general public. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotional content. A slight sense of joy might be inferred from the opportunity for homesteading, but it's very mild. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
