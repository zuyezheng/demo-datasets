    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document regarding tax information sharing between the US and Canada. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and authorize, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon review, I confirm that the order is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores remain low.",
