    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It waives a rule to allow an individual to serve on a state commission. There's no strong emotional content in such an action. The most likely emotion to be conveyed, if any, might be a mild sense of approval or satisfaction that the government is functioning efficiently. However, the intensity would be very low.",
