    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of disappointment and perhaps a touch of frustration regarding the court's proceedings. It highlights the lack of specific details and precision in the court's report, indicating a need for further investigation and a more thorough examination of the facts. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, but the underlying tone suggests a level of dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs. The president is conveying disappointment and a need for a more thorough investigation. The intensity of these emotions is relatively moderate, as the document focuses on outlining the deficiencies and directing corrective action rather than expressing strong emotional reactions. Therefore, I would score the emotions as follows: Joy: 1, Sadness: 3, Anger: 4, Fear: 1, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 3. After further consideration, I think the initial scores are appropriate.",
