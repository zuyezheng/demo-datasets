    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining procedures for civil service applications. It doesn't appear to be designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue there's a very mild sense of reassurance (joy) from establishing clear processes, and perhaps a tiny bit of surprise that such a detailed order is being issued. The other emotions (sadness, anger, fear, disgust) seem completely absent. Therefore, I'll assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the rest. After further consideration, the document is very procedural and unlikely to evoke any emotions. The initial assessment of joy and surprise is probably an overreach. I will revise all scores to zero.",
