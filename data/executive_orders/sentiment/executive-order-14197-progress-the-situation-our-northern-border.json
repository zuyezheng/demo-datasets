    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing the situation at the northern border. It highlights the threat posed by illegal migration and illicit drugs, potentially evoking fear and concern. However, it also expresses a willingness to cooperate with Canada and provides a temporary pause to assess their actions, suggesting a degree of hope or optimism. The order also aims to convey a sense of control and authority, reassuring the audience that the President is taking necessary steps to address the situation. Therefore, I will score it for fear, and surprise.",
