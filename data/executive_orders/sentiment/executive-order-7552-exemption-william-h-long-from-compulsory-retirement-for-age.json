    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of William H. Long from mandatory retirement. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the implicit emotions could be interpreted as follows:\n\n*   **Joy:** There is no explicit joy expressed. A score of 1 is appropriate.\n*   **Sadness:** There is no explicit sadness expressed. A score of 1 is appropriate.\n*   **Fear:** There is no explicit fear expressed. A score of 1 is appropriate.\n*   **Disgust:** There is no explicit disgust expressed. A score of 1 is appropriate.\n*   **Surprise:** There is no explicit surprise expressed. A score of 1 is appropriate.\n\nGiven the formal and legal nature of the document, the initial scores are all 1. Upon further reflection, there's no reason to change these scores.",
