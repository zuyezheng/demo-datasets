    "critique": "The executive order seems to want the audience to feel joy and surprise. The order discusses Fillmen's appointment to a classified position of instrument maker in the Smithsonian Institution without compliance with the requirements of the Civil Service Rules. The order also states that Fillmen has performed highly creditable and capable service for nine years in the private laboratories of the Smithsonian Institution, and it is desirable that he be appointed to the above-mentioned technical position, which is in the competitive classified service. This would make the audience feel joy and surprise.",
