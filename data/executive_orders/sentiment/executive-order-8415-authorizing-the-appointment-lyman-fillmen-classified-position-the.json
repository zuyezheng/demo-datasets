    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the appointment of Lyman A. Fillmen to a position in the Smithsonian Institution. The language is formal and bureaucratic, and the tone is neutral. There is no indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. The order seems to be motivated by a desire to recognize Mr. Fillmen's past service and appoint him to a suitable position. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
