    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal announcement about the transfer of records from defunct committees to the Department of Commerce. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue there's a hint of sadness due to the committees ceasing to exist because of lack of funding, and perhaps a touch of relief or satisfaction that the records are being properly preserved. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
