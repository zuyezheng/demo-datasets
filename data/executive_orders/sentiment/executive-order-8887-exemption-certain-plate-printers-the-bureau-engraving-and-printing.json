    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of urgency and necessity due to a shortage of qualified personnel. It aims to reassure the public that measures are being taken to address the situation. There isn't a strong emphasis on any particular emotion, but a mild sense of concern and perhaps a hint of relief that a solution is being implemented might be perceived. Therefore, I will assign low scores to most emotions, with a slightly higher score for concern (fear) and a minimal score for surprise.",
