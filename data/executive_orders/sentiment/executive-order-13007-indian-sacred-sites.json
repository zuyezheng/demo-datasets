The overall sentiment is one of respect and accommodation towards Native American religious practices. There is a sense of responsibility and commitment to protecting these sites.The primary emotion conveyed would be joy for those who support the order, and perhaps surprise that such an order is being enacted. There isn't a strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
