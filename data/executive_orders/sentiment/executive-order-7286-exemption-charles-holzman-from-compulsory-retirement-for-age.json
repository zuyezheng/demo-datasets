While it doesn't explicitly evoke strong emotions, there might be a subtle sense of joy that a person is being helped and a sense of surprise that the president is intervening. The order is a formal document, so strong emotions are unlikely. The initial scores reflect this, with slight adjustments made to the revised scores to better capture the subtle nuances.",
