    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of contract compliance functions for equal employment opportunity. It is primarily administrative and legal in nature. The language is formal and objective, with no explicit emotional appeals. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, reflecting the document's neutral tone and specialized subject matter. I will assign a score of 1 for all emotions initially, as there is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. Then, I will review and adjust based on any subtle implications.",
