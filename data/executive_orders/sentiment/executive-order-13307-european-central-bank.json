The language is legal and technical, and the purpose is to codify an agreement. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions. A slight sense of surprise might be intended, as the reader may not expect such an order. The order is not intended to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
