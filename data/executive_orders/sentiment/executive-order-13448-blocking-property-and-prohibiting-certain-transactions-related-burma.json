    "critique": "The executive order discusses sanctions against the government of Burma due to human rights abuses and repression. The order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination to address the situation. The primary emotions the president likely wants to evoke are anger (at the Burmese government's actions), sadness (for the victims of repression), and perhaps a degree of fear (to deter further abuses). There might also be a sense of disgust at the corruption and human rights violations. Joy and surprise are unlikely to be intended emotions.",
