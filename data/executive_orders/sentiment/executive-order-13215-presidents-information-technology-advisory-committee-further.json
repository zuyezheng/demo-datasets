    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily uses neutral and legalistic language. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, the document seems to convey a slight sense of continuation and resolve, but it's very subtle. Therefore, the 'surprise' score should be 1, 'disgust' score should be 1, 'fear' score should be 1, 'joy' score should be 1, and 'sadness' score should be 1.",
