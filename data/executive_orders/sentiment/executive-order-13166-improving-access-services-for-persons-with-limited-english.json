It aims to improve access to federally conducted and federally assisted programs and activities for persons with limited English proficiency. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of purpose and commitment to improving accessibility, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low across all emotions.",
