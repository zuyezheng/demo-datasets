It aims to convey a sense of seriousness and decisiveness, but doesn't strongly emphasize any particular emotion. The language is formal and bureaucratic, not designed to evoke strong feelings. Therefore, all emotions should be scored relatively low. Initial scores: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 1. Revised scores: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 1.",
