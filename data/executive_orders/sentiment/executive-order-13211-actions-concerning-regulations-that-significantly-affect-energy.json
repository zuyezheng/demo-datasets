    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It outlines a policy regarding the assessment of energy effects of governmental regulations. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the order seems to convey a sense of determination and resolve to improve the quality of agency decision-making related to energy. It aims to address a perceived lack of information and improve the internal management of the Federal Government. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions, with a slightly higher score for determination which can be interpreted as a low level of joy.",
