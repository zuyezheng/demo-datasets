    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and collectedness. There isn't a strong push for any particular emotion, but perhaps a slight sense of reassurance that the government is taking steps to improve decision-making related to energy. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel disgust, fear, joy, sadness, or surprise. The order is very procedural and formal. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
