There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and objective, focusing on the conditions and requirements for employees to acquire civil service status. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on the lack of negative emotions like fear and disgust.",
