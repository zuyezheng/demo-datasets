    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the exemption of Herbert A. Smith from mandatory retirement. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic. There is no strong emotional content. A baseline of 1 is appropriate for most emotions, as the document aims for neutrality. There might be a slight sense of joy that Herbert A. Smith is allowed to continue his service, but it's very subtle. Similarly, there's a very mild sense of surprise that an exemption is being made, but again, it's minimal.",
