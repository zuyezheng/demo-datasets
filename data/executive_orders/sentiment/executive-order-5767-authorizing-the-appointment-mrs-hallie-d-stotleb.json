    "critique": "The executive order discusses the appointment of Mrs. Hallie D. Stotler, the widow of a prohibition officer who died in the line of duty. The order aims to evoke a sense of sympathy and perhaps a touch of gratitude for the sacrifice of the officer. It is unlikely to evoke joy, fear, disgust, or surprise. Sadness is likely the primary emotion. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
