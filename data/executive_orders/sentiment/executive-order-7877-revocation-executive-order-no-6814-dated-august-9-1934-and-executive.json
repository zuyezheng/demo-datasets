The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional content. The revocation is presented as a neutral action, with assurances that existing rights and liabilities will not be affected. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
