    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to improve the efficiency and fairness of civil litigation involving the U.S. government. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a sense of determination to improve the legal system is present. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive intent of improving the system.",
