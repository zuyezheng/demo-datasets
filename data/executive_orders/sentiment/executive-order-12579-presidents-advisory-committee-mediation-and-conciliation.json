    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It extends the life of the President's Advisory Committee on Mediation and Conciliation. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of satisfaction or relief that the committee's work can continue, but this is very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy to reflect the positive outcome of the extension.",
