    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about appointing someone to a position, and it's hard to imagine it would make people feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be very low for all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
