This suggests a desire to convey relief and support for soldiers in combat. The order aims to reduce unnecessary burdens on soldiers in hostile environments. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is a mild sense of relief and support.",
