    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative document outlining the order of succession for the office of Attorney General. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is very procedural. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain low.",
