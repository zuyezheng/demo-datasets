    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the order of succession for the Attorney General. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The language is legal and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
