    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The language is legalistic and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After reflection, this seems appropriate given the document's nature.",
