    "critique": "The document is a formal authorization from the President. It lists the types of documents to which the Secretary of State is authorized to affix the Seal of the United States. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed. The primary emotion might be a very mild sense of authority or perhaps a hint of tradition, but these are very subtle. Therefore, most scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on the lack of negative emotions.",
