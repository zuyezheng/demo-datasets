    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding a labor dispute and the creation of a Board of Inquiry. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the context suggests a concern for national health and safety due to the strike, which could imply a sense of worry or urgency. The president is not attempting to portray joy, but there might be subtle undertones of concern or perhaps even a hint of frustration that the situation has escalated to this point. I will score the emotions based on these subtle undertones, keeping in mind the formal and neutral tone of the document.",
