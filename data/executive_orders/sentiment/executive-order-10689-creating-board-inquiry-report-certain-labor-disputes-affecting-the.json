    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order creating a Board of Inquiry to address labor disputes in the maritime industry. The language is legalistic and factual, with the primary goal of conveying the necessity of government intervention to prevent disruption to national health and safety. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the implicit emotions are sadness and fear. The sadness comes from the fact that the strike has the potential to affect a substantial part of the maritime industry. The fear comes from the fact that the strike, if permitted to continue, will imperil the national health and safety. There is no indication of joy, disgust, or surprise.",
