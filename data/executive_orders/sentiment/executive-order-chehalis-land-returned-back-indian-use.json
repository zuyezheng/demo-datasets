    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for the Chehalis Indians. It primarily uses neutral and legal language. There is a slight indication of sadness due to the restoration of land to the public domain, which might negatively impact the Chehalis Indians. However, there's also a sense of potential joy or relief conveyed by setting aside other land for their use. The other emotions are not strongly present.",
