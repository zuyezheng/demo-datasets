    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the evaluation of risk and avoidance of unanticipated takings related to the Fifth Amendment. It aims to ensure government actions are well-reasoned and fiscally accountable. The language is legal and procedural, lacking emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, reflecting the document's neutral tone and purpose.",
