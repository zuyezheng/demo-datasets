    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of responsibility and caution regarding the use of governmental power and its potential impact on private property rights. It emphasizes fiscal accountability and adherence to the Constitution. The order does not seem to want to evoke strong emotions but rather a sense of reasoned governance. Therefore, the scores should be low across the board.",
