    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It delegates authority from the President to the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs regarding certain sections of title 38 of the United States Code. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotional content. A baseline of 1 is appropriate for most emotions, as the document aims for neutrality. There might be a slight sense of importance or seriousness, but it's not explicitly conveyed as sadness, joy, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
