    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It delegates authority and outlines responsibilities. There is no strong emotional content. The most relevant emotions would be a very mild sense of Joy that veterans affairs are being addressed, and perhaps a touch of Surprise that such a dry topic is being analyzed for emotion. All other emotions are not applicable. The initial scores reflect this, and the revised scores are the same as there is no new information.",
