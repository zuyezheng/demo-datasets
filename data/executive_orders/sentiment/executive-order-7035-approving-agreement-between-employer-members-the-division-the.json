    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of an agreement related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. It's a legal and administrative document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The language is formal and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the document's neutral tone and purpose. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact.",
