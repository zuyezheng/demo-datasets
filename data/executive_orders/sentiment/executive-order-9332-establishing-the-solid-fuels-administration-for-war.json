    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the regulation of solid fuels during wartime. It is a formal and legal document. The primary emotions conveyed are related to the seriousness and urgency of the war effort. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the context implies a sense of urgency and the need for efficient resource management to support the war effort. Therefore, I will assign low scores to fear and surprise, and very low scores to the other emotions.",
