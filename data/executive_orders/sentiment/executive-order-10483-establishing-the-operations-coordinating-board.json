    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and control. It establishes a board to coordinate national security policies, which could inspire confidence (joy) and reduce anxiety (fear). However, the language is formal and bureaucratic, so the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. The abolishment of the Psychological Strategy Board might evoke a slight surprise, but overall, the order is designed to be perceived as a procedural matter.",
