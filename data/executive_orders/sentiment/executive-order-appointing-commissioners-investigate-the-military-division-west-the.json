    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining the appointment of special commissioners and their responsibilities. It focuses on investigation and reporting, with an emphasis on legal and procedural aspects. There is no explicit attempt to evoke emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and objective, aiming to establish a clear framework for the investigation. Therefore, all emotion scores should be low.",
