    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of administrative functions related to national cemeteries and memorials in Europe. It's a legal and administrative document, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The primary emotions, if any, would be related to the importance of honoring war dead, but the document itself is quite dry and procedural. Therefore, all scores should be low.",
