    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to communicate information and instructions regarding rewards for the apprehension of certain individuals. It revokes rewards for some individuals. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. However, the revocation of rewards could potentially evoke a sense of surprise or perhaps disappointment in those who were hoping to claim them. The mention of individuals like John Wilkes Booth and Jefferson Davis might evoke some sadness or anger in some readers, depending on their historical understanding and personal feelings about those figures. However, the primary purpose is not to evoke these emotions, so the scores should be relatively low. The initial scores reflect a minimal level of surprise, sadness, and anger, with the revised scores slightly adjusted to reflect the informational nature of the document.",
