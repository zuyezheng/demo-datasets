    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The president is creating a board to investigate a dispute, so surprise is not relevant. There is no anger, disgust, fear, joy, or sadness conveyed in the document. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. The revised scores should reflect the lack of emotional content.",
