    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of an appointment. It expresses no explicit emotion. However, one could argue there is a slight sense of sadness due to the mention of Jacob Strong's death and the reference to his widow. There might also be a hint of joy that Mrs. Strong is being taken care of. The other emotions are not present. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The revised scores are similar, but slightly adjusted to reflect the subtle emotions more accurately.",
