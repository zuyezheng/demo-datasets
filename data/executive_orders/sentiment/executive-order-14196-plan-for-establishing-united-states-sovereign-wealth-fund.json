    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a sense of purpose and determination to improve the financial health of the United States. There's a hint of optimism (joy) about the future economic security and international leadership. There is no explicit sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise expressed in the document. The language is formal and aims to convey a sense of authority and responsibility. Therefore, the initial scores are: Joy: 4, Sadness: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. After further consideration, the joy score could be slightly higher to reflect the positive outlook for the future. The other scores remain the same as there is no indication of those emotions.",
