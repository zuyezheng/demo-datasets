    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about establishing units of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. The order itself doesn't seem to evoke strong emotions. It's more about authorization and direction. However, considering the context of the time (1942) and the purpose of the order (supporting the Army), one could argue that it might inspire a sense of joy and surprise. The order could instill joy in those who support women's involvement in the army. The order could instill surprise as it amends a previous executive order.",
