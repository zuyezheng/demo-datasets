    "critique": "The document is a formal order from President Roosevelt withdrawing public lands for use as a National Guard rifle range. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue there is a hint of determination and resolve in securing resources for national defense, but it is very subtle. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for determination which could be interpreted as a low level of joy or surprise that the order is being made.",
