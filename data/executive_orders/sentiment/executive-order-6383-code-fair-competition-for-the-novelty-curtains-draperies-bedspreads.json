The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the application has been approved and that the code complies with the law. However, this is very mild. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign a low score to joy and a score of 1 to all other emotions.",
