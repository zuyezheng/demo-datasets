    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and assurance in the government's actions. It's about implementing a code of fair competition, so the intended emotions are likely to be joy (that things are improving) and perhaps a bit of surprise (that the government is taking such action). There might be a slight reduction of fear or disgust related to unfair competition. Initial scores: Joy: 6, Surprise: 3, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Sadness: 0. Revised scores: Joy: 7, Surprise: 2, Fear: 0, Disgust: 0, Sadness: 0. The emphasis is more on joy and a sense of positive change.",
