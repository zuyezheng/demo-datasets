It aims to inform the public about the designation of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States and does not intend to evoke strong emotions. The order is purely informational and procedural. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon review, I confirm that the order is not designed to elicit any particular emotion, so the scores should remain minimal.",
