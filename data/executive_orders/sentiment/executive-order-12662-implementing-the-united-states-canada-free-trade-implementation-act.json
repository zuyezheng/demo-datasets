    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral, formal tone, primarily focused on legal and procedural aspects related to the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is informational and directive, setting out rules and establishing entities to facilitate the agreement. There's a slight element of reassurance or confidence in the established processes, but it's very subtle. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
