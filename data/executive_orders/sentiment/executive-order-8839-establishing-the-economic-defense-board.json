    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an Economic Defense Board. The language is formal and legalistic. The purpose is to coordinate economic activities related to national defense. There is a sense of urgency and determination, but no strong emotional appeal. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of seriousness and resolve in the face of a national emergency. Therefore, fear and surprise are not applicable. Disgust, joy, and sadness are not applicable either. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
