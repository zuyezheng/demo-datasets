    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of disappointment and perhaps a hint of frustration that the Crow Indians have not moved to the designated reservation. There's also a bureaucratic tone in describing the land agreement and its subsequent cancellation. It is unlikely to invoke strong emotions in the American public. The scores should reflect low intensities across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on sadness and perhaps a touch of disgust due to the broken agreement.",
