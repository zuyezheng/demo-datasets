The initial scores reflect a baseline assessment of the emotions conveyed, while the revised scores adjust based on a more nuanced understanding of the text. The document primarily conveys fear and concern due to the health risk, with a touch of disgust towards the disease. There's a slight element of surprise at the sudden influx of infected vessels. Joy and sadness are not significantly present.",
