    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of hope and reassurance regarding the economy. It acknowledges the difficulties caused by COVID-19 but emphasizes the administration's commitment to addressing them. It also seeks to instill confidence in businesses and the public by promoting fairness and reducing regulatory burdens. Therefore, the primary emotions to convey are joy (hope and optimism) and surprise (highlighting the administration's proactive measures). There might be a slight element of sadness due to the acknowledgment of the economic hardships, but it's less prominent.",
