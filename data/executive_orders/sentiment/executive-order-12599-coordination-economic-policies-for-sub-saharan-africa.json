It establishes a committee to coordinate US economic programs and policies in Sub-Saharan Africa with the goal of ending hunger through economic growth, policy reform, and private sector development. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no strong emotional sentiment conveyed. A slight sense of joy might be perceived due to the goal of ending hunger, but it's very mild. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
