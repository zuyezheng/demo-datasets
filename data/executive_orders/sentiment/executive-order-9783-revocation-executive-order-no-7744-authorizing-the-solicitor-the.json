    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily concerns legal and administrative matters, specifically the delegation of duties within the Department of Labor. The language is formal and devoid of emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions.I will set all initial scores to 1.\n\nRevised Scores: Given the critique, the initial scores seem appropriate as the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke strong emotions.",
