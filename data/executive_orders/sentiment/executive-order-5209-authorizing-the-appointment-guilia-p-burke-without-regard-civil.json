    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of an appointment. It expresses no explicit emotion. The recommendation by the Secretary of Treasury suggests a degree of approval or satisfaction, but this is not strongly conveyed. The mention of Mrs. Burke being the wife of a disabled World War veteran might evoke some sympathy or respect, but again, this is not the primary focus. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. Upon review, the mention of the veteran's wife could slightly increase sadness and joy.",
