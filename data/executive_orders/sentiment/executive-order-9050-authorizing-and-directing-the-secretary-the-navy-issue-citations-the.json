The language is formal and authoritative. There is a sense of pride and recognition for the units being cited, but the primary emotion conveyed is one of official recognition and authorization. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise should be scored low, while the other emotions should also be relatively low but present.",
