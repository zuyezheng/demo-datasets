    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order delegating authority related to international investment surveys. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The language is legal and procedural, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon further reflection, the document is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any significant emotional response. The revised scores should remain very low.",
