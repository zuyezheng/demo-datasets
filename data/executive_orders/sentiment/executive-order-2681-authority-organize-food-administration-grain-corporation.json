    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of urgency and control during a time of war. It should instill confidence in the government's ability to manage resources and ensure the well-being of the nation. Therefore, the primary emotions to convey are a sense of confidence and perhaps a touch of seriousness. There might be a slight element of fear due to the context of war, but it shouldn't be the dominant emotion. There is no element of joy, disgust, or surprise.",
