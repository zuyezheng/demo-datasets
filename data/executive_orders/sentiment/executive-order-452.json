    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of efficiency and fairness. It discourages personal interviews to ensure equal treatment and prevent the neglect of those who cannot easily travel. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are a sense of calm acceptance and perhaps a touch of disappointment that personal interviews are becoming unmanageable. There's no strong indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or strong surprise. The order seems designed to manage expectations and streamline processes, so the emotional impact is likely to be subtle. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
