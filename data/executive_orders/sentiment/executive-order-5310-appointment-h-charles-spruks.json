    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on informing the audience about the appointment and the reasoning behind it. There's no apparent intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and factual, emphasizing Mr. Spruks's qualifications and the recommendation from the Acting Secretary of State. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be very low. Upon further consideration, the order might evoke a slight sense of surprise due to the unusual nature of bypassing civil service rules, but the emphasis is more on justification than shock. Therefore, I will adjust the surprise score slightly upwards, but keep the rest at a minimum.",
