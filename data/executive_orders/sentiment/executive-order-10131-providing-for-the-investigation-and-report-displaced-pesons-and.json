    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal and procedural document. It designates the Displaced Persons Commission as the agency responsible for investigations and reports related to displaced persons seeking admission into the United States. The order also outlines the roles of other government departments in assisting the Commission. There is no explicit attempt to evoke any particular emotion. However, one could argue that the order aims to inspire a sense of trust and confidence in the government's handling of displaced persons seeking admission into the United States. It could also evoke a sense of hope for those seeking admission. I will score it accordingly.",
