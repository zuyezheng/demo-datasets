    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the investigation of displaced persons seeking admission into the United States. It primarily concerns the designation of the Displaced Persons Commission and outlines inter-agency cooperation. The language is legal and procedural, lacking emotional expression. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores will be set to 1 for all emotions due to the lack of emotional content. After further consideration, the initial scores accurately reflect the lack of emotional sentiment in the document.",
