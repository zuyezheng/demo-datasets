    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that withdraws land from settlement to protect the watershed supplying water to Los Angeles. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy for the people of Los Angeles who will benefit from the protected watershed. There might also be a mild sense of sadness for those who are restricted from settling on the land. Surprise, fear, disgust, and anger are unlikely to be conveyed.",
