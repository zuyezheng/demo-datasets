It provides a brief background on her late husband's service and death, and states the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury. The language is formal and factual. There is a hint of sadness due to the mention of her husband's death, but it is not the primary focus. There is no explicit expression of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores are assigned based on this analysis.",
