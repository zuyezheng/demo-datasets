It primarily involves administrative updates, specifically naming individuals appointed as members. There is no indication of the president attempting to portray any specific emotion. The language is formal and factual, lacking emotional cues. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a default score of 1 due to the lack of emotional content.",
