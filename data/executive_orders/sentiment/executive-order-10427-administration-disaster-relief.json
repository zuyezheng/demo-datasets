    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding federal disaster relief. It is a formal and legal document. The primary emotions conveyed, if any, would be related to a sense of preparedness and responsibility. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Revised scores will reflect a slightly increased sense of responsibility and preparedness, but still relatively low.",
