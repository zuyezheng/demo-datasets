    "critique": "The executive order aims to address drug shortages and ensure public health. The primary emotion conveyed is concern and a sense of urgency regarding the issue. It also aims to instill confidence that the administration is taking action to resolve the problem. The order does not seem to want to convey joy. It does want to convey sadness because people are sick and don't have access to drugs. It does want to convey anger because some participants in the market may use shortages as opportunities to hoard scarce drugs or charge exorbitant prices. It does want to convey fear because shortages of pharmaceutical drugs pose a serious and growing threat to public health. It does want to convey disgust because some participants in the market may use shortages as opportunities to hoard scarce drugs or charge exorbitant prices. It does want to convey surprise because the number of prescription drug shortages in the United States nearly tripled between 2005 and 2010, and shortages are becoming more severe as well as more frequent.",
