    "critique": "The document expresses concern about drug shortages and their impact on public health. The President is attempting to convey a sense of urgency and determination to address the problem. The emotions most likely to be felt by the American public are fear (related to the potential lack of access to life-saving medications) and sadness (related to the suffering caused by drug shortages). There might also be some surprise at the extent of the problem. Disgust and joy are unlikely to be conveyed by this document.",
