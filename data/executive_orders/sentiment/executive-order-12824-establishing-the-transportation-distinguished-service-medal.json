    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document establishing a new medal for the Coast Guard. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of joy or pride for members of the Coast Guard who are recognized for their service. There might also be a slight sense of surprise that such a medal was not already in place. Other emotions like sadness, anger, fear, and disgust are not relevant in this context.",
