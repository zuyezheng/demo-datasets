    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document. It does not seem to want to evoke any strong emotions. The order is simply directing that the issue of Registers to vessels by the Authorities of Hawaii shall cease. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, while the document is primarily informational, there might be a slight sense of surprise due to the abrupt nature of the directive. The revised score for surprise is adjusted to reflect this nuance.",
