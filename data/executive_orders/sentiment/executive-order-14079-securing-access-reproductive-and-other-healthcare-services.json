It acknowledges the 'devastating implications' of restricted access and aims to address the 'crisis facing women's health.' While the language is formal, there's an underlying sense of urgency and resolve. Therefore, sadness and fear get moderate scores, while joy is low, and surprise is minimal. Disgust is present due to the restrictive laws, but not overwhelming. ",
