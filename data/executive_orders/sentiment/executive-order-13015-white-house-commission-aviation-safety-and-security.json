    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission on aviation safety and security. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the establishment of the commission suggests a concern for safety and security, which could be interpreted as a response to a potential threat or past incidents. Therefore, a low level of fear and concern might be inferred. All other emotions are not explicitly conveyed, so they should be scored as 1.",
