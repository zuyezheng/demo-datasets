    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that revokes a previous order withdrawing public lands in Arizona. The language is formal and factual, and the content is specific to land descriptions. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. The order is simply a legal action with specific details. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
