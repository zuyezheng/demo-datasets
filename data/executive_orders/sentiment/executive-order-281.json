    "critique": "The document is a formal order to close government offices for the funeral of ex-President Chester Alan Arthur. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the mourning of a former president. There might be a touch of surprise due to the unexpected nature of death, but it's minimal. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, with sadness being the highest, followed by a low surprise score. The revised scores are similar, with a slight adjustment to sadness to reflect the solemnity of the occasion.",
