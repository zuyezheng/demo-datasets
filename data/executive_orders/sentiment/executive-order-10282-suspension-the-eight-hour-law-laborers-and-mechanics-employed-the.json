    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of urgency and resolve in addressing a national emergency. While it may not explicitly evoke strong emotions, the mention of 'national emergency,' 'defense program,' and the suspension of labor laws suggests a need for heightened vigilance and a willingness to take necessary measures. Therefore, I will score it for fear and surprise.",
