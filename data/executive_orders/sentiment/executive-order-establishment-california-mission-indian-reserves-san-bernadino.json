    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for Indian purposes. It's a legal document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of hope or relief for the intended beneficiaries, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, a low score for joy is appropriate. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, so these should be scored as 1.",
