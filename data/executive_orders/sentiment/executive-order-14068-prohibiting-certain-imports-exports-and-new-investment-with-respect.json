    "critique": "The document is an executive order imposing sanctions on Russia. It is a formal and legal document. The primary emotion conveyed would likely be a sense of resolve and perhaps a degree of anger or disgust towards the actions that led to the sanctions. However, the document itself is written in a neutral tone, so the emotional impact is more about the context than the explicit language.I will score it accordingly.",
