    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of resolve and determination to address a national emergency. It's unlikely to evoke joy or sadness. There might be a mild sense of surprise at the extent of the measures, but primarily, it should instill a sense of seriousness and perhaps a touch of fear in those who might be affected by the sanctions. Disgust might be felt towards the actions that led to the order.",
