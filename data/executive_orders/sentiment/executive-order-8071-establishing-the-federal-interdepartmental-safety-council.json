    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and order, with a hint of reassurance that the safety of federal employees is being taken seriously. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or even surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, designed to convey a sense of responsibility and diligence rather than emotional impact. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions.",
