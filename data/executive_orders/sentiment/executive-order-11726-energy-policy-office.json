    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an Energy Policy Office. The language is formal and bureaucratic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the creation of such an office might implicitly convey a sense of concern or perhaps even urgency regarding energy matters. Given the context, the public might feel a mild sense of reassurance (low joy) that the President is addressing energy issues, but also a low level of concern (low fear/sadness) that such measures are deemed necessary. There's no indication of anger, disgust, or strong surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slight bump for joy, fear, and sadness.",
