    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that suspends a provision of Title 10 of the United States Code. The order is related to the number of officers serving in the grade of lieutenant general. The order is in effect until June 30 of the fiscal year following that in which the national emergency proclaimed by Proclamation No. 2914 of December 16, 1950, shall end. The order is signed by the president and dated February 19, 1966. I don't think the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion after reading the executive order. The order is a legal document, and the goal is to make a change to the law. The order is not intended to evoke any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
