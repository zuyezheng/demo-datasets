    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order to include Relapsing Fever (louse-borne) in the list of communicable diseases. The language is very formal and factual. The order aims to inform the public and relevant authorities about the updated list of communicable diseases for public health and safety. There is a mild sense of fear and disgust that the president wants to convey. The order does not aim to evoke joy, sadness, or surprise.",
