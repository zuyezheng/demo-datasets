    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and stability rather than strong emotions. The mention of economic emergency might induce slight fear, but the overall tone is formal and focused on industrial recovery and fair competition. The president expresses a desire to protect employees' rights, which could evoke a sense of joy or relief, but again, the language is measured. The revisions to the code and the study by the Federal Trade Commission suggest a cautious approach to addressing inequities, which might inspire a little surprise or curiosity. Disgust and sadness don't seem to be emotions the order tries to convey.",
