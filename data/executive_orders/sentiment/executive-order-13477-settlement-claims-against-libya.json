    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of resolution and closure regarding claims between the US and Libya. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild element if the reader was unaware of the prior agreements, but overall, the primary goal is to communicate a legal and administrative decision in a neutral manner. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions.",
