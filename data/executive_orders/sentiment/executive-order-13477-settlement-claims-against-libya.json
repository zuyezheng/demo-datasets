    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding the settlement of claims between the United States and Libya. It is primarily legal and procedural in nature. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal. There is no indication of an attempt to convey joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should reflect this neutrality.",
