    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of purpose and determination to address the needs of rural communities. While not explicitly joyful, there's an underlying sense of optimism and hope for positive change. There's no indication of anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a prominent emotion. Therefore, I will score joy, sadness and surprise. I will give a low score to sadness as the document acknowledges the challenges faced by rural communities, but the overall tone is forward-looking and solution-oriented. I will give surprise a score of 1 as it is not present in the document.",
