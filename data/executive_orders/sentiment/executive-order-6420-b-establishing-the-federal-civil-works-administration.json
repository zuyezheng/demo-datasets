    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Federal Civil Works Administration. The primary goal is to increase employment. The language is legal and administrative, lacking strong emotional expression. However, there is a sense of hope and determination to address the economic crisis. Joy is low, as it's a formal document, but present due to the positive goal of increasing employment. Sadness is also low, but acknowledged as the order is a response to the depression. Fear and disgust are negligible. Surprise is also low, as such orders are not unexpected during a crisis.",
