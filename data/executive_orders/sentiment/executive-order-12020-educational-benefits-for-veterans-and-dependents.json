    "critique": "The executive order is about energy conservation and payment of educational benefits to veterans and their dependents. The order aims to reassure veterans and their families that their benefits will continue even if schools close temporarily to conserve energy. There is a sense of relief and perhaps slight joy that benefits are protected. There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion is a mild sense of joy or relief.",
