    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative action regarding land management in Arizona. It revokes a previous order related to public lands after a resurvey. The language is formal and legalistic, and the content is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is factual and procedural, so it doesn't seem designed to elicit any particular emotion from the reader. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
