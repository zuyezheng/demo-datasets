    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document about civil service rules. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotions might be surprise (due to the amendment) and perhaps a very mild sense of joy (for those who benefit from the change) or sadness/disgust/fear (for those who are negatively affected). However, these would be very mild. I will set initial scores accordingly and then revise to reflect the overall neutral tone.",
