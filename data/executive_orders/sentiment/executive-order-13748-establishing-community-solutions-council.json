There is a sense of hope and optimism, but it is tempered by the formal and procedural nature of the document. Therefore, joy and surprise should be relatively low. There is an acknowledgement of existing problems, which introduces a degree of sadness. There isn't any explicit anger, fear, or disgust conveyed.",
