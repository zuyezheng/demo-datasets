It aims to convey a sense of preparedness and strength, potentially instilling a sense of security and confidence (joy) while also acknowledging the potential need for urgent action (fear). There's no indication of disgust or sadness. Surprise is not the primary emotion, but the order's decisive nature might evoke a mild sense of it.",
