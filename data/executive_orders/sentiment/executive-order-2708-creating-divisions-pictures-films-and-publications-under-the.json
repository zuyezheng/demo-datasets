The order does not explicitly aim to evoke negative emotions such as sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. However, it may indirectly aim to reduce any existing apathy or indifference towards the war. The primary emotions the order seeks to convey are joy (in the sense of patriotic fulfillment) and surprise (in the sense of novelty).",
