    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of optimism and confidence in the government's ability to improve its civil service. It emphasizes merit, efficiency, and attracting able individuals. Therefore, joy and surprise might be emotions the president wants to evoke, although subtly. There's no indication of wanting to evoke sadness, fear, or disgust. The initial scores reflect this, with joy and surprise having low positive scores and the others at zero. After further consideration, the emphasis on improving the civil service and attracting able individuals suggests a slightly stronger intent to evoke joy. The surprise element is more about the novelty of the program, so it remains low.",
