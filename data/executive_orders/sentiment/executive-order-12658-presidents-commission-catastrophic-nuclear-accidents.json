    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to study compensation for victims of catastrophic nuclear accidents. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of responsibility and concern for potential victims, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, the initial scores are set to reflect the formal and neutral tone of the document, with slight increases in sadness and fear due to the nature of the topic.",
