    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to study compensation for victims of nuclear accidents. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the subject matter (catastrophic nuclear accidents) could evoke fear and sadness in the public. The establishment of a commission might also inspire a degree of hope or relief, but this is less prominent. Disgust and surprise are unlikely to be significant emotions conveyed by this document. Therefore, I will assign initial scores based on these considerations.",
