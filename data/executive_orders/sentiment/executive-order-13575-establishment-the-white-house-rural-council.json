    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of purpose and determination to improve the lives of people in rural communities. There might be a hint of joy in the potential positive outcomes, but it's not overt. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order aims to address challenges, but the tone is more about proactive solutions than dwelling on negative emotions. Therefore, joy is scored a 3, and all other emotions are scored a 1.",
