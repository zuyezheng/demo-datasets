The primary emotion the president wants to convey is a sense of assurance and confidence in the government's ability to handle international child abduction cases. There may be a tinge of sadness related to the circumstances of child abduction, but it is not the main focus. There is no intention to evoke fear, disgust, joy, or surprise.",
