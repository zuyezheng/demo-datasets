    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of progress and fairness. It seeks to balance the rehabilitation of inmates with the protection of free labor. Joy should be conveyed because the order promotes rehabilitation and opportunity. Sadness is not a primary emotion, but there might be a slight sense of regret for past limitations. Anger, fear, and disgust are not intended emotions. Surprise is not a major factor, but the change from the previous order might elicit a mild surprise.",
