There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, a sense of urgency and determination can be inferred due to the context of national defense. Therefore, I will assign low scores to emotions like fear and surprise, and slightly higher scores to joy (in the sense of national unity) and sadness (due to the war context). Disgust is not relevant here.",
