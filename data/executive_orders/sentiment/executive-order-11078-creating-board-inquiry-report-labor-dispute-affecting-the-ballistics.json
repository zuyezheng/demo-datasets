    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration regarding a labor dispute. It expresses concern about a potential strike and its impact on national safety. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the implicit emotions conveyed might be concern (leading to a low score for fear and sadness) and perhaps a hint of surprise that the situation has escalated to this point (leading to a low surprise score). There's no indication of joy or disgust. The scores should be very low across the board, with slight emphasis on concern/fear and sadness.",
