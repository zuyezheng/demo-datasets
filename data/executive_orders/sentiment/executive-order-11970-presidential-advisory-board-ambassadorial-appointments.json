    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a Presidential Advisory Board. It outlines the board's responsibilities, membership, and operational guidelines. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no overt expression of emotions. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all categories. Most of the scores are 1, indicating a neutral emotional tone. There's a slight possibility of 'surprise' due to the establishment of a new board, but it's not significant, so a score of 2 is assigned.",
