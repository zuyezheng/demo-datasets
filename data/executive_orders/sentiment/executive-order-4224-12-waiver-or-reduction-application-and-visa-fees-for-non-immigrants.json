    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining regulations for visa fees. It does not appear to be intended to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and instruct, not to elicit feelings of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further consideration, while the document is primarily informational, there might be a slight sense of relief or satisfaction for those who benefit from the visa fee modifications. However, this would be a very mild emotion. Therefore, I will keep the scores low, but adjust joy slightly upwards.",
