    "critique": "The document expresses concern about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) harming American interests and impeding foreign policy objectives. It aims to address these concerns by reviewing and revising enforcement guidelines. The president seems to convey a sense of determination to protect American economic competitiveness and national security. There is a hint of disgust and anger towards the current state of FCPA enforcement. There is no element of surprise, joy, or fear.",
