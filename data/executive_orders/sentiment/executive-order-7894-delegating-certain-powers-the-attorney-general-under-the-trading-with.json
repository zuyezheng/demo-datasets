    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document authorizing the Attorney General to exercise power. It does not seem to evoke any strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and procedural, and the content is about delegation of authority, not about events or issues that would typically elicit emotional responses. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact.",
