    "critique": "The executive order aims to evoke fear and a sense of urgency regarding border security. It emphasizes the protection of sovereignty and territorial integrity against threats like unlawful migration and criminal activities. The language used is strong and assertive, intended to instill a sense of seriousness and determination. The mention of a 'National Emergency' further amplifies the feeling of fear and the need for immediate action. There is also an element of disgust towards the 'unchecked unlawful mass migration and the unimpeded flow of opiates'.",
