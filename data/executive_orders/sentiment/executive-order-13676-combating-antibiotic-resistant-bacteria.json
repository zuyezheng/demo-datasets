    "critique": "The document expresses concern about antibiotic resistance and outlines a plan to combat it. It conveys a sense of urgency and determination, but avoids strong emotional language. Therefore, the initial scores are as follows:\n\nJoy: 1 (The document is formal and policy-oriented, not expressing joy.)\nSadness: 3 (There is a mention of deaths caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, contributing to a low level of sadness.)\nFear: 5 (The document highlights the threat to public health and the economy, indicating a moderate level of fear.)\nDisgust: 2 (The document does not explicitly express disgust, but the topic of disease can evoke a slight sense of it.)\nSurprise: 1 (The document presents information in a factual manner, without expressing surprise.)\n\nUpon further reflection, the initial scores seem reasonable. The document's primary focus is on addressing a serious problem, which naturally evokes some level of sadness and fear. The other emotions are less prominent.\n\nRevised scores:\nJoy: 1\nSadness: 3\nFear: 5\nDisgust: 2\nSurprise: 1",
