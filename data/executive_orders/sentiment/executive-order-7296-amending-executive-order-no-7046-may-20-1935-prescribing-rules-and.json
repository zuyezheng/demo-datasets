    "critique": "The executive order is an amendment to a regulation regarding the Works Progress Administration. It addresses lost time due to conditions beyond the control of workers and allows the Administrator to require that time to be made up without additional compensation. The order is formal and bureaucratic in tone. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a slight sadness or disappointment among workers who might have to make up lost time without pay, but this is a very mild emotion. Surprise could be present due to the change, but it is likely very minimal. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, or disgust.",
