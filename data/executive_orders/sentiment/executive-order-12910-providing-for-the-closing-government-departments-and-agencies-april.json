    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding the closure of government offices as a mark of respect for Richard Nixon. It expresses respect, but avoids strong emotional displays. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death of a former president, but it's a formal, respectful sadness. There's no explicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise present in the text. The scores should reflect this formal and respectful tone, with a slight emphasis on sadness.",
