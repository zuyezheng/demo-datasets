The primary emotion the president wants to convey is a sense of hope and optimism that the government is taking action to improve the economy and protect consumers, workers, and small businesses. There might also be a subtle undercurrent of anger or frustration at the current state of affairs, but this is less pronounced. There is no indication of fear, disgust, or surprise.",
