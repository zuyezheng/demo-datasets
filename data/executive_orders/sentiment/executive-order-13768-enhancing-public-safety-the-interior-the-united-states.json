    "critique": "The document expresses concern about public safety and national security due to removable aliens, particularly those who have committed crimes. It aims to address sanctuary jurisdictions and enforce immigration laws. The language used is formal and assertive, reflecting a sense of determination and resolve. The president is attempting to convey fear and disgust towards removable aliens who have committed crimes, and joy to the American public that the executive branch is taking action to ensure the public safety of the American people. The president is not attempting to convey sadness or surprise.",
