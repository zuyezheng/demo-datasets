    "critique": "The document is a legal document, specifically an executive order prescribing amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial. It is highly formal and technical in nature. The language is precise and devoid of emotional expression. The purpose is to establish and modify legal rules and procedures. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The document is primarily informative and directive, not designed to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the nature of the document, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal. Therefore, all initial scores are set to 1.",
