    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that amends the Manual for Courts-Martial. It is primarily concerned with establishing rules of evidence for military courts. The order is very technical and procedural. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a sense of order and structure, but even that would be mild. Therefore, I will score all emotions as 1.",
