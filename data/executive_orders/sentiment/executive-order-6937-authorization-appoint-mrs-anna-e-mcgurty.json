    "critique": "The document describes the appointment of Mrs. Anna E. McGurty as a clerk in the New York Post Office. The president is conveying sadness and perhaps a touch of joy. The sadness comes from the fact that Mrs. McGurty is a widow without adequate means of support. The joy comes from the fact that the president is able to help her. There is no anger, fear, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document. The initial scores are sadness: 7, joy: 4, and all other emotions: 1. The revised scores are sadness: 7, joy: 4, and all other emotions: 1.",
