    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily aims to convey a sense of authority and direction regarding labor relations. There's little to suggest strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legalistic and procedural, focusing on the enforcement of provisions and the role of the National Labor Board. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, the document does not evoke any strong emotions. The scores should remain very low, close to 1, to reflect the lack of emotional content.",
