    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending regulations in the Canal Zone. The language is legalistic and devoid of emotional expression. There is a slight sense of urgency implied by the reference to 'time of war' or imminent war, which might suggest a low level of fear or concern. However, the primary purpose is administrative, so most emotions should be scored very low.",
