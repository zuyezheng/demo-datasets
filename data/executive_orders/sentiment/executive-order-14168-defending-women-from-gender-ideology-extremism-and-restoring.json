    "critique": "The executive order aims to evoke fear and disgust towards the described 'gender ideology' and those who support it. It also attempts to instill a sense of joy and security in those who agree with the president's stance on the definition of sex and gender. There is a subtle undercurrent of sadness related to the perceived erosion of traditional values and the safety of women. Surprise is not a primary emotion the order seeks to convey.",
