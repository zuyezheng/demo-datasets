    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement of the adoption of an official flag for the United States Navy. The language is formal and factual, and the purpose is to inform the public of this decision. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a slight sense of joy and pride might be intended.
