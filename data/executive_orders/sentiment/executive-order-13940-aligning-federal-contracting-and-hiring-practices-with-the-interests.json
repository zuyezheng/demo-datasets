It also intends to instill a degree of fear and disgust towards the practice of hiring temporary foreign labor, which is portrayed as a threat to American jobs and national security. A touch of surprise might be conveyed regarding the extent of offshoring and its potential impact. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke sadness.",
