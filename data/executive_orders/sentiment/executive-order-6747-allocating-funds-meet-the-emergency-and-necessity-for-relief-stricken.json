The order does not seem to want to convey anger, fear, or disgust. It may want to convey a bit of surprise. Here's my initial assessment:\n\nJoy: 6 (relief and hope for farmers)\nSadness: 3 (acknowledging the distress in agricultural areas)\nSurprise: 4 (the amount of money allocated to help)\nFear: 1 (no intention to scare the audience)\nDisgust: 1 (no intention to disgust the audience)",
