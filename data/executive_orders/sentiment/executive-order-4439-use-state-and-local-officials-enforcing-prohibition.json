    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order. It discusses the enforcement of the National Prohibition Act and the appointment of state, county, or municipal officers as prohibition officers. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the nature of the document, the emotional intensity is likely to be low across all categories. Therefore, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for each emotion.",
