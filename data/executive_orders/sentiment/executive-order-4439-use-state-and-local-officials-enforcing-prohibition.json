    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of control and efficiency in enforcing the National Prohibition Act. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to convey a sense of order and legal authority. However, there might be a slight sense of surprise at the detail of allowing state officers to be appointed, and perhaps a touch of joy for those who support prohibition.",
