    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a code of fair competition. The language is legal and administrative, with no strong emotional indicators. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment, but not in an overtly emotional way. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise due to the positive nature of the announcement.",
