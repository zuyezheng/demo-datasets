The joy comes from the appointment of Mr. Wilson, and the surprise comes from the fact that he is being appointed without regard to the civil-service rules. However, the order is also somewhat sad, as it suggests that Mr. Wilson may not be the most qualified candidate for the position. The order does not seem to convey any anger, fear, or disgust.",
