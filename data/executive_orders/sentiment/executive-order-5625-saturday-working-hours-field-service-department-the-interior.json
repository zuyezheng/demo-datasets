While it might bring a bit of joy to those benefiting from the shorter Saturday workdays, the primary goal isn't to evoke strong emotions. It's more about establishing a standard and providing exceptions where necessary. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise due to the change in working hours.",
