    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, focused on ensuring the continuity of judicial functions in Puerto Rico. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is a formal designation of an acting judge, so it should not make the audience feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores for all emotions should be 1. After further consideration, the order is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores should remain at 1 for all emotions.",
