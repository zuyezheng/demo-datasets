    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of an acting judge. It is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The language is legal and procedural. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Considering that there might be a hint of joy that someone is being designated and a hint of sadness that the judge is absent, ill, or has a legal disability, I will assign a score of 2 to joy and sadness. The other emotions are not relevant.",
