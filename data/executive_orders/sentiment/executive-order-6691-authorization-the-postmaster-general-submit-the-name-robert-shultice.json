    "critique": "The executive order is a routine administrative action, so it should not evoke strong emotions. The order waives a previous executive order to allow the nomination of a postmaster. This is unlikely to cause joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, the scores should remain low, as the document is purely administrative and does not contain any emotionally charged content.",
