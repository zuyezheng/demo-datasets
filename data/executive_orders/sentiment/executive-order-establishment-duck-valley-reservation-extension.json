The primary emotions conveyed would likely be interpreted as neutral. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Since there is not enough information, I will assign a score of 1 to all the emotions.",
