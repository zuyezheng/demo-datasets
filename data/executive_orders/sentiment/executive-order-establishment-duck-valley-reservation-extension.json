    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land withdrawal and reservation for Native American tribes. It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is minimal. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of hope or relief for the Native American tribes, but it's very subdued. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
