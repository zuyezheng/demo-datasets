    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to instill a sense of patriotism and duty. The removal of gender-specific terms is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The core message revolves around the commitment of American soldiers, their dedication to freedom, and their responsibility. This should evoke a sense of joy and trust. There might be a hint of fear and sadness related to the possibility of combat or captivity, but these are secondary. Disgust and surprise are not relevant.",
