    "critique": "The executive order is a set of amendments to civil service rules, primarily concerning the inclusion of the 'classified railway mail service' within existing regulations. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on specific changes to rules and procedures. There is no indication of an intent to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The order aims to clarify and update regulations, not to inspire joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
