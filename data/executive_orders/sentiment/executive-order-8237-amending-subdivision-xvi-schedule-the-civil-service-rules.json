    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order amends a subdivision of the Civil Service Rules, which is unlikely to evoke joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The most likely emotion might be a mild surprise that such a specific order is being issued, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, all emotions are scored very low initially.",
