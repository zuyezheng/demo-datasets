The primary emotion conveyed would be a sense of responsibility and determination to address air pollution. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this, with low values for all emotions except perhaps a slight sense of responsibility which could be interpreted as a low level of determination (akin to joy/optimism).",
