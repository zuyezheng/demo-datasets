    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission. It focuses on the structure, function, and administration of the commission. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional expression. However, the underlying concern for workers and communities facing economic change suggests a degree of sadness and perhaps a hint of hope (joy) for positive change. Fear and disgust are not apparent. Surprise is also not a factor, given the nature of the document.",
