    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding San Nicholas Island. It revokes previous orders and places the island under the control of the Secretary of the Navy, while reserving sites for the Department of Commerce. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The expected emotional response from the public is likely to be neutral, as it's a routine government action. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. Upon further reflection, while the document itself doesn't convey strong emotions, the act of reserving land for naval uses might evoke a slight sense of surprise or concern in some, so I'll adjust the surprise and fear scores slightly upwards.",
