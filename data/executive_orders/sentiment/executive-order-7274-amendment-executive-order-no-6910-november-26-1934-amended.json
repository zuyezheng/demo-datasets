    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document that modifies a previous order regarding land use. It removes certain lands from the scope of a previous order, specifically those lands within established grazing districts. The language is formal and legalistic, and the content is specific to land management.There is no explicit attempt to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. The order is simply a matter-of-fact declaration of a change in land management policy. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be very low, as the document is not designed to elicit any emotional response.Revised scores: Disgust: 1, Fear: 1, Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Surprise: 1",
