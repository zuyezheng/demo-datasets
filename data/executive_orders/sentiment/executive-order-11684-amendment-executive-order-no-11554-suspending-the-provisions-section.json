    "critique": "The executive order is a technical amendment to a previous order, dealing with the promotion of Navy and Marine Corps officers. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such a specific detail is being addressed at the presidential level, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, all emotions are scored very low initially.",
