    "critique": "The document expresses a sense of firm resolve and determination to reverse a previous policy. There is a clear disapproval of the previous administration's actions, suggesting a level of disgust. The document aims to reassure those who support the Hyde Amendment, potentially evoking joy in that demographic. However, it may also cause sadness or fear in those who oppose the order. Surprise is unlikely to be a dominant emotion. Given the context and language, I will score the emotions accordingly.",
