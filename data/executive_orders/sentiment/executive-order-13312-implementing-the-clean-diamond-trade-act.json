    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding diamond trade. It aims to implement the Clean Diamond Trade Act and address threats to international peace and security. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, implicit emotions can be inferred from the context. There is a sense of determination to address conflict and human rights violations (disgust, sadness), a sense of urgency to avoid undermining the legitimate diamond trade (fear), and a sense of satisfaction in implementing the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (joy). Surprise is not relevant in this context.",
