    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document, and its primary goal is to establish and enforce regulations regarding diamond trade. It aims to convey a sense of authority, seriousness, and commitment to international agreements and national security. While it addresses conflict and human rights violations, it does so in a formal and detached manner. Therefore, the emotions it seeks to evoke are minimal, but a slight sense of reassurance and trust might be intended. Initial scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 2, Anger: 1, Fear: 2, Disgust: 2, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
