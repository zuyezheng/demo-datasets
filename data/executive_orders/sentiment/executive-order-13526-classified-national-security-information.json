    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the classification, safeguarding, and declassification of national security information. It aims to balance the need for government transparency with the protection of sensitive information. The language is formal and legalistic, with a focus on procedures, authorities, and responsibilities. There is a sense of seriousness and importance, but emotions are largely absent due to the document's objective and regulatory nature. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
