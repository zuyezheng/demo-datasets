    "critique": "The executive order is a simple amendment to include the editor and photographer positions in the Geological Survey as places to be filled by noncompetitive examination. This is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a mild surprise that such a specific amendment is being made, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
