    "critique": "The document is an executive order about positions in the Department of Interior. It seems to be a routine administrative update, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotions might be surprise (if the public was unaware of these positions) or perhaps mild joy/satisfaction if someone was waiting for this change. However, the overall emotional impact is expected to be minimal. I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
