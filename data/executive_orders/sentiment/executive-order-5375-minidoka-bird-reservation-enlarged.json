    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the expansion of the Minidoka Reservation in Idaho for the protection of native birds. The language is legal and administrative, with a focus on outlining the boundaries of the expanded reservation, the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, and prohibited activities within the reservation. There is a warning about penalties for violating the order. The document does not express strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are low across all emotions.",
