    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land inclusion in the Uinta National Forest. It's primarily a legal and administrative document. There is no explicit emotional language used. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions set to 1. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains the primary factor. The revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
