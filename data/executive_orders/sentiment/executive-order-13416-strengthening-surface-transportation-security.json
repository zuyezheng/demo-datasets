    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining policy and procedures related to transportation security. The primary emotion the president wants to convey is a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to protect its citizens. This can be achieved by instilling a mild sense of fear regarding potential threats, coupled with a stronger sense of confidence (which translates to joy in this context) that these threats are being addressed. There might also be a hint of surprise at the level of detail and coordination involved.",
