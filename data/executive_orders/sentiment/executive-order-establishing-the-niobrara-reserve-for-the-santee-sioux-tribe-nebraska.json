    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document about land allocation for the Santee Sioux Indians. It doesn't seem to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of hope or relief for the Santee Sioux Indians, but it's very subtle. Therefore, I'll assign low scores to these emotions.",
