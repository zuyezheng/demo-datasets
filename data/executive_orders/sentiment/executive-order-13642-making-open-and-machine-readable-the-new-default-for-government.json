The primary emotion the president likely wants to convey is a sense of joy and optimism about the potential benefits of these policies, such as economic growth, job creation, and improved services. There might also be a subtle element of surprise at the extent of innovation and progress that can be achieved through open data. There isn't a strong emphasis on negative emotions like sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
