    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of optimism and purpose related to open government and its benefits. There's an element of confidence in the government's ability to deliver efficient services and promote economic growth. There isn't a strong indication of negative emotions such as sadness, fear, disgust, or anger. Surprise is also not a primary emotion conveyed, as the order seems to be a planned and deliberate action. Therefore, joy is the most appropriate emotion to score, with other emotions receiving low scores.",
