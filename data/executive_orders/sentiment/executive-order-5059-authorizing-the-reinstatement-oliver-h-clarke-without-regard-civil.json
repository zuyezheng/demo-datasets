    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the reinstatement of Oliver H. Clarke. The language is neutral and factual. There is a slight hint of positive sentiment due to the recommendation by the Secretary of the Treasury, but overall, the document is not strongly emotional. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions except for surprise, which I will set to 1 due to lack of information.",
