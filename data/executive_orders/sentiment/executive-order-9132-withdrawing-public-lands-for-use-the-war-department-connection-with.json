It focuses on resource allocation for a critical project (Fort Peck Dam) and emphasizes the continued conservation of natural resources where possible. The primary emotion conveyed should be a sense of confidence and perhaps mild surprise at the scale of the project, but not fear, disgust, or sadness.",
