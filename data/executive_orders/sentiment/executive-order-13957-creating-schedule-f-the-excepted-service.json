    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a need for more efficient management of federal employees and aims to streamline the process of hiring and removing employees in policy-related positions. There is a sense of urgency and determination to improve government operations. However, the language is formal and legalistic, so strong emotions are unlikely. The document expresses a mild level of concern about the current state of performance management and a desire for improvement. Therefore, I will assign low scores for sadness and fear, and a slightly higher score for surprise due to the mention of the Merit Principles Survey. Joy and disgust are not apparent in the document, so they will be scored low. There is a mild sense of determination to improve government operations, so I will assign a low score for anger.",
