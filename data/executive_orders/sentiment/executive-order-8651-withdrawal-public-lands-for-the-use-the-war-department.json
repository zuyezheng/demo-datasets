The primary goal appears to be establishing a military aerial bombing and gunnery range. There is a hint of concern for existing rights and previous withdrawals, but it is minimal. Therefore, the emotions conveyed are minimal. Initial scores: Disgust: 1, Fear: 1, Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Surprise: 1. Revised scores: Disgust: 1, Fear: 1, Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Surprise: 1.",
