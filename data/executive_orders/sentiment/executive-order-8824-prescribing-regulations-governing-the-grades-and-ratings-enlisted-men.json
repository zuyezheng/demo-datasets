    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a routine administrative document. It sets grades and ratings for enlisted men in the Regular Army for the fiscal year 1942. It references a previous executive order and provides a specific exception related to the number of enlisted men in the 7th grade. There is no indication that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
