The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the implicit emotions are: concern (sadness) about the potential disruption of essential transportation services, and a sense of urgency (fear) to resolve the disputes quickly to avoid negative consequences. There is no display of joy, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are based on this assessment.",
