    "critique": "The document is a legal order adding land to the Cache National Forest. It is a formal and administrative document. The primary emotion conveyed would be a sense of official action, but not strongly. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After revision, I will keep the scores low, as the document is not designed to evoke strong emotions.",
