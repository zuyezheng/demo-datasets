The likely intended emotional response is a sense of justice or resolution for the Native American community, but the document itself doesn't explicitly evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. Initial scores: Joy: 2, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.
