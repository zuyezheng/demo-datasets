    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of mourning for Caleb B. Smith, the late Secretary of the Interior. It expresses sadness and respect for his service. The order to drape the executive buildings in mourning and the communication of sympathy to the family clearly indicate sadness. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, these emotions should be scored low.",
