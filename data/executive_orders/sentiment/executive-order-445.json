    "critique": "The document expresses sadness and respect for the deceased Caleb B. Smith. The order to drape executive buildings in mourning and the expression of sympathy indicate sadness. The description of Smith as a 'prudent and loyal counselor' suggests respect and admiration, but not necessarily joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The intensity of sadness is moderate, given the formal nature of the announcement. The other emotions are minimal.",
