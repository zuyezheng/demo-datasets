    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to convey a sense of respect for nature and the importance of conservation. It also intends to instill a sense of responsibility and adherence to the law. The emotions that the president wants the audience to feel are joy (for the preservation of wildlife), and potentially surprise (at the strictness of the regulations). Disgust, fear, and sadness are not intended emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
