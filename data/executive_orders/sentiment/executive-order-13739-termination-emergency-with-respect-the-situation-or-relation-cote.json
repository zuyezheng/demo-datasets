    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration by the President of the United States. It primarily concerns the termination of a national emergency related to the situation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The language is legal and procedural. There's a sense of relief and satisfaction that the situation has improved, but it's conveyed in a very understated, formal way. Therefore, joy and surprise should be low. Sadness, fear, and disgust are also low, as the document focuses on the positive progress and termination of the emergency.",
