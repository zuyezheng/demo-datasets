The language is legal and administrative, with no strong emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a neutral emotional tone. After further consideration, I still believe that the document is primarily informational and lacks any significant emotional conveyance. The revised scores remain at 1 for all emotions.",
