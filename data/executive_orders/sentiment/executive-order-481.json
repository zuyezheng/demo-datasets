The language is neutral and factual, without any explicit emotional expression.The order revokes appointments and abolishes the office, but it does not express any sentiment about this action. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal. Considering that there is not enough information provided, a score of 1 is given to all emotions.",
