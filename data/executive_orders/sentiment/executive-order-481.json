    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone. It's an administrative announcement about abolishing a military governorship. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is formal and direct, focusing on the revocation of appointments and abolishment of the office. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
