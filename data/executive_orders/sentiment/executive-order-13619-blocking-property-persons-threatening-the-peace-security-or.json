    "critique": "The executive order discusses sanctions against Burma due to human rights abuses and actions that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Burma. The order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination to address these issues. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are concern (leading to sadness) about the situation in Burma, and a firm resolve (potentially leading to a sense of fear in those targeted by the sanctions) to take action. There might also be a hint of surprise that these actions are still necessary despite some progress in Burma.",
