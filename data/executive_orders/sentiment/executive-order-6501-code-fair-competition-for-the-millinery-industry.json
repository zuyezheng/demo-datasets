    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order and fairness, but it doesn't strongly evoke any particular emotion. It's more about conveying a sense of authority and process. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. The initial scores reflect this, with slightly more emphasis on surprise due to the formal announcement. The revised scores further reduce the emotional impact, focusing on a neutral tone.",
