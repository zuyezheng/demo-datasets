It primarily deals with legal and administrative matters, specifically amending a previous executive order related to the authority of the Secretary of the Interior. There is no explicit emotional language or sentiment expressed. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Since there isn't enough information, I will assign a score of 1 to all the emotions.",
