    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal document that grants access to tax returns for a specific committee. It does not seem designed to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The primary purpose is to inform and authorize, not to elicit feelings. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Initial assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a very mild sense of surprise due to its specific nature, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Revised assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
