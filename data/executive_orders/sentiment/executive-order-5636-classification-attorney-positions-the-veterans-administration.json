    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and confidence in the merit-based system. It eliminates a previous rule and integrates attorneys into the classified civil service, suggesting a move towards fairness and competence. The order doesn't seem to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Instead, it aims for a sense of order and efficiency. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further reflection, while the primary goal isn't to evoke strong emotions, there might be a subtle sense of reassurance or relief for those who value a merit-based system. This could translate to a slight increase in the 'joy' score. Also, those who preferred the previous system might feel a tinge of sadness or disappointment, so a very slight increase in the 'sadness' score might be warranted.",
