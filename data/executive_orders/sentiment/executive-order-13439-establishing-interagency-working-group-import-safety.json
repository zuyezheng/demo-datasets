    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to address the safety of imported products. The primary emotion the president likely wants to convey is a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to protect its citizens. This can be achieved by instilling a sense of safety (low fear) and perhaps a touch of surprise that the government is taking action. There is no intention to evoke joy, sadness, disgust, or anger.",
