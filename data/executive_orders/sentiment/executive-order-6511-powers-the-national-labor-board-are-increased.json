The primary goal is to maintain industrial peace and resolve disputes between employers and employees. There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are not explicitly conveyed. A score of 1 is appropriate for each of these emotions.",
