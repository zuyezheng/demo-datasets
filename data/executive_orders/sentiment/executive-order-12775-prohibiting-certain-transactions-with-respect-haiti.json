    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing a threat. It evokes a sense of concern and perhaps a touch of fear regarding the situation in Haiti, but also a sense of resolve to protect US interests. There might be a hint of disgust towards the actions of the de facto regime. Surprise is not a primary emotion, but the declaration of a national emergency might elicit some surprise. Joy and sadness are not intended emotions.",
