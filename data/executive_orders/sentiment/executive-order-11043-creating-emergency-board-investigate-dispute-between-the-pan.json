It expresses a sense of urgency and necessity to resolve the dispute to avoid disruption of essential transportation services. The emotions conveyed are minimal, as it is a legal and administrative document. I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for concern (reflected in sadness and fear) due to the potential disruption of services.",
