    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that revokes previous executive orders related to defunct international organizations. The language is very formal and factual. There is no intention to evoke any strong emotions in the reader. The most relevant emotion might be a very mild sense of closure (sadness) that these organizations are no longer active, but it's very minimal. There's no reason for joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
