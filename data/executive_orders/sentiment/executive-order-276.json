    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the maintenance of the Statue of Liberty. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is a sense of purpose and direction, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions. Considering the formal nature, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for most emotions, increasing the score only if there's a clear indication of that emotion. There's a slight hint of joy and surprise that the statue is finally being taken care of, so I will give those a score of 2.",
