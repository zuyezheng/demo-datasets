    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President regarding the maintenance of the Statue of Liberty. The language is formal and directive, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the subject matter (the Statue of Liberty) and the act of preserving it could evoke feelings of joy and perhaps a sense of national pride or awe (surprise). The intensity of these emotions is likely to be low, as the document itself is not designed to be emotionally stirring but rather to be a practical directive. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise, and a score of 1 to the other emotions due to lack of information.",
