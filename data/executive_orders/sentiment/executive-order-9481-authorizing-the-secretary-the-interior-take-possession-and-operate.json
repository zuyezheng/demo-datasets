It should instill a sense of confidence that the President is taking necessary actions to ensure the war effort is not impeded. The primary emotion to convey is a sense of reassurance and resolve, minimizing fear and uncertainty. Surprise, disgust, joy, and sadness are not the primary emotions the order seeks to evoke.",
