Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, reflecting the positive impact of volunteer work. There might be a slight element of surprise at the extent of the government's commitment to this initiative, but it's not a dominant emotion. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
