    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the procedures for classifying and declassifying national security information. It aims to establish a uniform system and protect sensitive information while ensuring public access to government activities where appropriate. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are a sense of security (that national security is being protected) and trust (that the government is being transparent and accountable). There might be a hint of fear conveyed to emphasize the importance of protecting national security information, but it should not be overwhelming. There is no indication of joy, disgust, or surprise.",
