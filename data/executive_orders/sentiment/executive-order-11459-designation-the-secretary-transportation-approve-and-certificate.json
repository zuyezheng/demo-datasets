    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document outlining the delegation of authority to the Secretary of Transportation regarding international transport regulations. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions in the reader. However, one could argue there's a slight sense of reassurance (low joy) that things are being handled efficiently, and perhaps a tiny bit of surprise that such a specific order is being issued. The other emotions (sadness, anger, fear, disgust) don't seem relevant at all.",
