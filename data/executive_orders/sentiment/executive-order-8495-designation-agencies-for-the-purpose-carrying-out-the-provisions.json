    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the purchase, transport, and distribution of materials and supplies for the relief of refugees. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic. There is a sense of urgency and determination to provide aid, but emotions are not explicitly expressed. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low across all emotions. After a second thought, the document does show compassion and a sense of duty, so I will adjust the joy and sadness scores slightly to reflect this.",
