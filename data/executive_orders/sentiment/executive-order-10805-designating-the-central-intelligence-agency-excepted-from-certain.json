    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses no strong emotions. The use of 'WHEREAS' and 'NOW, THEREFORE' indicates a formal tone. The emotions conveyed are minimal, so I will assign low scores across the board. There is a slight sense of decisiveness, which could be interpreted as a very mild form of joy or satisfaction in resolving an issue, but it's very subtle. Surprise, sadness, fear, and disgust are not present.",
