    "critique": "The executive order aims to address anti-Semitism. It acknowledges the rise in anti-Semitic incidents and expresses a commitment to combating them. The order seeks to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against prohibited forms of discrimination rooted in anti-Semitism. The order wants to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing anti-Semitism, but it also wants to avoid inflaming tensions or causing undue alarm. Therefore, the emotions conveyed should be sadness (due to the existence of anti-Semitism), and a bit of surprise (that anti-semitism still exists).",
