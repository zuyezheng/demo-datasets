It aims to establish a policy for marking US foreign assistance to foster goodwill and ensure that the assistance supports US foreign policy objectives. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional appeals. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
