There is no strong emotional language used. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Considering it is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for most emotions, increasing the score only if there is a clear indication of that emotion being conveyed. There isn't a sense of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise being conveyed. Therefore, all initial scores will be 1.",
