    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of relief and perhaps slight joy that a plant is being returned to private operation, signifying progress in national defense. There's no indication of fear, disgust, or sadness. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order follows a logical sequence of events. The primary emotion is joy, with a secondary sense of reduced fear or anxiety. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the joy and reduce the other emotions to better align with the document's intent.",
