    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order. It invokes legal authority and outlines the extension of the Federal Aviation Act to areas outside the United States where the Federal Government has jurisdiction. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the determination that the action is in the \"national interest\" suggests a sense of purpose and perhaps a subtle emphasis on national security. Given the formal nature, the emotional scores should be low, reflecting the absence of overt emotional expression.",
