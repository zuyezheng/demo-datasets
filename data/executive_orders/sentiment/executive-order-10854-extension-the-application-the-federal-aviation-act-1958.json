    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It invokes legal authority and outlines the extension of the Federal Aviation Act to areas outside the United States under specific conditions, including consultation with the Secretaries of State and Defense. The language is legalistic and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The purpose is to establish a legal framework for aviation regulation in specific international contexts. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal, with low scores across all emotions. If there is not enough information, use a score of 1.",
