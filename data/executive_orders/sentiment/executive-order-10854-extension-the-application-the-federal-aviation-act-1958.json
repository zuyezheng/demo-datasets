    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document, and it is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. The order is extending the application of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to areas outside the United States, and it is important that the order is clear and concise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be 1. After further consideration, I think that the executive order might want the audience to feel a sense of surprise that the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 is being extended to areas outside the United States. Therefore, the revised score for surprise should be 2.",
