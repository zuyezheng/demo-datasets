    "critique": "The executive order is a very dry, technical document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order extends the exemption of Arthur W. Exline from compulsory retirement. While this might bring joy to Exline, the document itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. I will assign low scores across the board, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise, as the audience might be mildly happy or surprised that someone is being granted an exemption.",
