    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. The primary goal is to convey a sense of purpose and direction in addressing the nation's economic challenges. There's an underlying sense of hope for economic recovery and a commitment to improving the prosperity of the American people. However, given the formal nature of the document, strong emotions are unlikely to be explicitly expressed. Therefore, the scores should reflect a moderate level of joy and a low level of other emotions.",
