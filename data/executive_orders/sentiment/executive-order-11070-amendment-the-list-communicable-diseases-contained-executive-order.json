The language is very formal and legalistic. There is no explicit emotional expression. However, a slight sense of concern or caution might be inferred due to the nature of the document dealing with public health and communicable diseases. Therefore, I will assign low scores to fear and sadness, and a minimal score to disgust, as the document deals with diseases. Joy and surprise are not relevant in this context, so they will be scored as 1.&#x20;",
