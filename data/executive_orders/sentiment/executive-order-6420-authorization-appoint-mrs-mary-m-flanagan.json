    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is specific to an individual and a position, suggesting a localized impact. The language is formal and bureaucratic, further reducing emotional impact. The recommendation by the Postmaster General adds a layer of approval, but doesn't necessarily change the emotional tone. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions.",
