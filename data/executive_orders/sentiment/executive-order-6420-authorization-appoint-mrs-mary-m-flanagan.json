    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Mary M. Flanagan. There is no explicit emotional language used. The context suggests a routine administrative action. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Initial scores are set to 1 for all emotions due to the lack of emotional content. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains the primary factor. The revised scores will also be 1 across all emotions.",
