    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to restrict the use of chemical toxicants on Federal lands to protect wildlife and the environment. The language is formal and legalistic, with a focus on policy and definitions. There is a sense of responsibility and concern for the environment, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions.",
