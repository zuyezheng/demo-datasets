    "critique": "The document outlines restrictions on granting rights for public works in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, requiring approval from the US military and the Secretary of War. There's no explicit emotional language used. The context suggests a focus on control and governance rather than expressing a specific emotion. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. Upon review, the lack of emotional content warrants a minimal score for all emotions.",
