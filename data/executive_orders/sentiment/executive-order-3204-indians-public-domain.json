    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document extending a restriction. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order appears to be a routine extension, so it shouldn't cause surprise. There's no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. The initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon further reflection, while the document is unlikely to evoke strong emotions, there might be a slight sense of relief or satisfaction for those benefiting from the extension, so I will adjust the joy score slightly upward. There is no indication of negative emotions.",
