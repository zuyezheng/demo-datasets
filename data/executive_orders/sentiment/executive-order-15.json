The most relevant emotions might be surprise or perhaps a mild sense of joy if the order is seen as beneficial, but overall, the emotional intensity is expected to be low. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values across all emotions. The revised scores remain low, with a slight increase in surprise to acknowledge the potential for unexpectedness in such orders.",
