The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions. Considering that this is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions to indicate a minimal level of formality and intent. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
