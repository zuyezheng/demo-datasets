    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of relief and resolution, but not strong emotions. It's primarily a formal announcement. The order is about terminating a previous order, so it should evoke a mild sense of relief (joy) that a wartime measure is no longer needed. There might be a very slight sense of surprise that this order is being terminated now, but it's minimal. There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
