The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of duty and purpose, with a secondary emphasis on national economic welfare and personal security. There's a subtle sense of joy associated with the idea of citizens investing in their own and the nation's future, but it's not overt. There's no indication of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
