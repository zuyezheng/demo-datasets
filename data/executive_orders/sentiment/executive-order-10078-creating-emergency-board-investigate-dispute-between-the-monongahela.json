    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. It expresses a sense of urgency and authority, but avoids strong emotional language. The primary emotion conveyed, albeit subtly, is concern (leading to a low fear score) that a disruption of interstate commerce may occur. There's no explicit joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise. The language is very measured and neutral, so most scores should be low.",
