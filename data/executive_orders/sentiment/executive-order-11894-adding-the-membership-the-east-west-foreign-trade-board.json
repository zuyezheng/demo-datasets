    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order to include the Secretary of Defense as a member of the East-West Foreign Trade Board. The language is very formal and does not aim to evoke any strong emotions. The primary goal is to communicate a change in the board's composition. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be very low. Revised scores reflect the lack of intended emotional impact, setting all emotions to 1.",
