    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It amends a previous order to allow Indian Service employees in medical or sanitary roles to hold state, county, or municipal positions with the Secretary of the Interior's consent, provided it doesn't interfere with their federal duties and they receive no additional compensation if full-time. The language is legal and administrative, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low initially. After further consideration, the document does not evoke any strong emotions. The initial scores are appropriate.",
