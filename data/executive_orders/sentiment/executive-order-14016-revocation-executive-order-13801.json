    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It revokes a previous order and provides instructions for implementation. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal across all emotions. However, depending on one's political views, there may be slight joy or sadness depending on whether they agree with the revocation of the executive order. The scores are set to 1, indicating a very low intensity of any emotion.",
