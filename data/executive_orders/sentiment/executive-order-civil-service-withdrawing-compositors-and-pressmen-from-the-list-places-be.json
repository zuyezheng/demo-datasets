    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement about a change in the appointment process for compositors and pressmen. It revokes a previous rule that allowed for noncompetitive examination and mandates competitive examination going forward. The language is neutral and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Since there is not enough information to portray any emotion, a score of 1 will be given to all the emotions. After a thorough re-evaluation, the initial assessment remains accurate. The document's content and language are devoid of emotional cues, justifying the low scores across all emotions.",
