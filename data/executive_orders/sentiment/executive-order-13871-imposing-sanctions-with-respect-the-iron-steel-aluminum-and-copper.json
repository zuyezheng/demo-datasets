    "critique": "The executive order is primarily concerned with national security and economic policy related to Iran. The intended emotions are likely to be a sense of resolve and perhaps concern about the threats posed by Iran. There might be a desire to instill a sense of fear regarding Iran's actions, but also a sense of security through the actions taken in the order. Disgust might be present regarding Iran's actions, and surprise is unlikely to be a significant factor.",
