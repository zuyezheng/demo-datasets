    "critique": "The executive order describes a ceremony commemorating the raising of the US flag over Fort Sumter, a site of significant historical importance in the Civil War. The order aims to evoke a sense of national pride, closure, and perhaps a degree of triumph over the Confederacy. It is unlikely to evoke sadness, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but not the primary emotion. Joy is likely the primary emotion.The initial scores are joy: 7, sadness: 2, anger: 3, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 4. After further consideration, I think the order is more about closure and respect for the past, so I will reduce the joy score and increase the sadness score slightly. I will also reduce the surprise score.",
