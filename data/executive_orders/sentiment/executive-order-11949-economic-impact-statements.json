The order is about changing the title and a date in a previous executive order. It seems like the intended emotion is neutral. However, to the extent that such changes might be perceived as improvements or necessary adjustments, a slight sense of satisfaction or relief (low-level joy) might be intended, but it would be very minimal.",
