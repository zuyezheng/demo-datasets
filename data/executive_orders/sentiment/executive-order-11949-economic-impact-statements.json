    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily consists of amendments to a previous executive order. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Considering that this is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions to reflect the minimal emotional tone inherent in such documents. After further consideration, the initial scores seem appropriate as the document is purely procedural and lacks any emotional expression.",
