    "critique": "The president expresses frustration with the overwhelming number of office applications, leading to exhaustion and neglect of public duty. This suggests sadness and perhaps a touch of disgust. There's also a desire for surprise, hoping people will understand and comply with the new rules. The intensity of sadness is moderate, disgust is low, and surprise is moderate as well. No joy or fear is present.",
