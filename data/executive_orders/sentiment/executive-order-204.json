The president is clearly not joyful, but rather expresses sadness and disgust at the overwhelming number of applications for office. There's a hint of fear about the neglect of public duty if the situation continues. Surprise is not a prominent emotion. The initial scores reflect these observations, and the revised scores fine-tune the intensity of each emotion based on the language used.",
