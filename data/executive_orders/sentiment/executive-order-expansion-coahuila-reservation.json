    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land allocation for Mission Indians. It's a factual statement with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a low score of 1 for each emotion initially. Upon further reflection, while the document itself is neutral, the act of setting aside land for the Mission Indians could evoke a slight sense of joy or relief in some, and perhaps a little surprise in others. However, these emotions would likely be very mild. Therefore, I will keep the scores at 1 for all emotions.",
