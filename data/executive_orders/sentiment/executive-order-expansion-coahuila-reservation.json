    "critique": "The executive order is a formal declaration regarding land allocation for Mission Indians. It aims to convey a sense of resolution and justice, but it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy for those who support the cause of the Mission Indians, and perhaps a touch of sadness that it was not done sooner. There's no apparent reason for anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
