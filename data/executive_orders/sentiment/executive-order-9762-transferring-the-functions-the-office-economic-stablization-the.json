    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document about transferring authority and functions between offices. It doesn't seem to explicitly aim to evoke any strong emotions in the reader. However, one could argue that there might be a slight sense of reassurance or stability conveyed, as the order ensures the continuation of existing regulations and actions. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the rest.",
