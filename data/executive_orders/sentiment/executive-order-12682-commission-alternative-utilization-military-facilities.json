    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to explore alternative uses for underutilized military facilities. The language is legal and procedural. There is no explicit emotional expression. However, the underlying goals of addressing nonviolent prisoners, drug abusers, and the homeless could be interpreted as conveying a sense of concern or hope, but these are very subtle. Therefore, the initial scores are set to reflect the formal and unemotional nature of the document, with slight increases to sadness and hope.",
