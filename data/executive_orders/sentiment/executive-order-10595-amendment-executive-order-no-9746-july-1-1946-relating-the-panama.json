    "critique": "The document is an executive order amending a previous order related to the Panama Canal. It primarily deals with administrative and supervisory roles, specifically designating the Secretary of the Army to supervise the Canal Zone Government and outlining the organization of the government. There is no language that conveys any strong emotion. The order is formal and legalistic in tone. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
