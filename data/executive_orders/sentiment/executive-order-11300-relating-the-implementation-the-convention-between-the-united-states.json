    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal declaration regarding the designation of authorities to fulfill treaty obligations with Greece. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The primary goal is to ensure compliance with international agreements. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. Upon further reflection, the order is very neutral and procedural. There is no intention to evoke any of the listed emotions. Therefore, I will revise all scores to 1.",
