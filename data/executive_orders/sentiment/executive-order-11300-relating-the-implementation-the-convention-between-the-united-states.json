    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding a treaty with Greece. It designates the Attorney General as the responsible party for fulfilling the treaty's obligations. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion initially, as there is not enough information to suggest any specific emotional response. Upon review, this seems appropriate as the document is purely administrative.",
