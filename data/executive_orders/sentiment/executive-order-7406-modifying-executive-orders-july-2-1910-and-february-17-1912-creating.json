    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document, thus, it shouldn't evoke strong emotions. The order is simply modifying previous orders to allow the Secretary of Interior to approve railroad applications. There might be a slight sense of satisfaction or relief for those who benefit from the railroad, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, so the revised scores remain the same.",
