    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding an amendment to the Code of Fair Competition for the Alcoholic Beverage Wholesale Industry. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. The context suggests a routine administrative action. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the lack of emotional content remains clear. The revised scores will remain the same.",
