    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about an amendment to the Code of Fair Competition for the Alcoholic Beverage Wholesale Industry. The primary goal appears to be to inform the public and relevant stakeholders about the decision. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of reassurance or satisfaction for those who have been following the issue and are in favor of the amendment. Therefore, I will assign low scores for joy and surprise and zero for the other emotions.",
