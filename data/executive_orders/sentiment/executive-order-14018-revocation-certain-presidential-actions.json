    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a tone of resolute authority and decisive action. The revocation of prior orders might evoke a sense of surprise in some, but the overall intent isn't to elicit strong emotional responses. The primary goal is to communicate a change in policy direction and a return to established legal and procedural norms. Therefore, the emotional intensity scores should be relatively low across the board.",
