It primarily conveys a sense of authority and decisiveness, but it doesn't strongly express emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The revocation of previous orders might imply a rejection of past policies, but this is more about policy change than emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
