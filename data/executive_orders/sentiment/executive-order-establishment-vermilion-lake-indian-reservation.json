    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a reservation for the Boise Fort Band of Chippewa Indians. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions scored at 1. The revised scores remain the same after considering the lack of emotional expression in the document.",
