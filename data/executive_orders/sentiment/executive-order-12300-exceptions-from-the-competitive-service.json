The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such a specific order is being issued, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values across all emotions. The revised scores remain low, with a slight increase in surprise to acknowledge the specificity of the order.",
