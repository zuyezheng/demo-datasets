    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of control and stability during a time of potential economic instability (likely during wartime, given the references to the National War Labor Board). It's about preventing drastic changes in wages and salaries, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy or sadness. Fear or disgust are also unlikely. Surprise might be a very mild element, as the order introduces new regulations, but the primary goal isn't to shock anyone. The main emotions conveyed are probably a sense of calm and perhaps a little bit of reassurance that things are being managed. However, since the text is very formal and legalistic, the emotional impact is minimal. Therefore, all scores should be low.",
