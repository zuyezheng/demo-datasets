    "critique": "The document is a presidential order addressing labor disputes in mines during wartime. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of urgency and determination to maintain coal production for the war effort. There's no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there's an underlying sense of concern about the potential disruption caused by the strikes, which could be interpreted as a mild form of fear or anxiety. The order aims to project an image of control and resolve. The language is formal and authoritative, reflecting the gravity of the situation.I will score surprise as 1, disgust as 1, joy as 1. Fear and sadness are also minimal, but present, so I will score them as 2. The strongest emotion is the implied anger at the labor disputes, which I will score as 5.",
