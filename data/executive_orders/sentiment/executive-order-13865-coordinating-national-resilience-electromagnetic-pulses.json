    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order outlining the US government's policy and actions to prepare for the effects of electromagnetic pulses (EMPs). The language is formal and technical, focusing on definitions, roles, responsibilities, and implementation steps. There is a sense of urgency and concern about the potential risks posed by EMPs to national security and economic stability. However, the document maintains a neutral tone, avoiding overtly emotional language. Therefore, the scores should reflect the underlying concern without exaggerating any particular emotion.",
