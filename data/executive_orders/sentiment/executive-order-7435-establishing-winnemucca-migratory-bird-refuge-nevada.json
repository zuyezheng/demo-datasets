    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and assurance regarding the protection of migratory birds and wildlife. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on the practical aspects of land withdrawal and reservation. However, a very mild sense of joy might be present due to the positive impact on wildlife conservation, but it's not a primary goal of the document. Therefore, the initial scores will be very low across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
