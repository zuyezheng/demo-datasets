    "critique": "The executive order aims to prevent anti-competitive practices like identical bidding. The primary emotion the president wants to convey is a sense of confidence and assurance that the government is taking steps to ensure fair competition and protect taxpayer money. There might be a secondary emotion of concern regarding the potential for collusion and its negative impact on the economy. However, the order is more about proactive measures than dwelling on negative emotions.",
