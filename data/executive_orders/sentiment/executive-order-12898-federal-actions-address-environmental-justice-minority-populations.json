    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to address environmental justice concerns, particularly for minority and low-income populations. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of purpose and determination to rectify inequalities, but it's conveyed through policy and directives rather than overt emotional expression. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should be scored low, reflecting the document's formal and objective tone.",
