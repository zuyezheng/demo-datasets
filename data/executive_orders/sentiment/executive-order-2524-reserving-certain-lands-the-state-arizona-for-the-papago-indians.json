    "critique": "The executive order is primarily a legal document that establishes a reservation for the Papago Indians. It revokes previous orders and defines the boundaries of the reservation. The language is formal and technical, focusing on land descriptions and legal provisions. The primary emotion conveyed should be joy for the Papago Indians, and perhaps surprise for those unaware of the situation.",
