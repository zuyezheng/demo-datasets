    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal declaration regarding land allocation for Mission Indians. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue there's a hint of joy for those benefiting from the reservation and perhaps a touch of sadness related to the land being withdrawn from sale/settlement. There might be a little surprise that this is happening. Disgust, fear, and anger don't seem relevant.",
