    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a very procedural and unemotional document. It simply outlines who can act as a hostess in the absence of the head of a diplomatic mission's wife. There's no indication that the president wants the audience to feel any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low initially. Upon further reflection, there might be a tiny bit of surprise due to the specificity and somewhat antiquated nature of the order, but it's still very minimal.",
