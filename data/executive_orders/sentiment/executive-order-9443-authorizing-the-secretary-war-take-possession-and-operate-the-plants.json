    "critique": "The document expresses a tone of determination and resolve in ensuring the continuation of the war effort. It uses formal and legalistic language, indicating a serious and urgent situation. The president is taking decisive action to address a labor dispute that threatens war production. There's a sense of urgency and necessity, but not necessarily strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed might be a sense of determined action, which could be interpreted as a low level of concern or perhaps a moderate level of determination to overcome obstacles.I will score surprise, sadness, joy, disgust, and fear as 1 since there is not enough information to score it higher.",
