    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about frequency assignments for government radio stations. It's unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to inform the relevant departments about the updated assignments. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, as it's a routine administrative action. The revised scores will remain low.",
