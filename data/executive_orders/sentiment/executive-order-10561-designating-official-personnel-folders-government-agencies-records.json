    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily establishes guidelines for maintaining personnel records within the Federal Government. There is no strong indication of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and procedural. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After a second thought, I will keep the scores as they are, as the document is purely administrative and does not convey any specific emotion.",
