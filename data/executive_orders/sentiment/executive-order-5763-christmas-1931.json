    "critique": "The executive order is a simple announcement about a holiday for federal employees. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight joy for the employees receiving a day off, but it's very mild. Therefore, I will assign a low joy score and zero for other emotions. Upon further reflection, the order is quite routine and unlikely to evoke any significant emotion. The joy score should be even lower.",
