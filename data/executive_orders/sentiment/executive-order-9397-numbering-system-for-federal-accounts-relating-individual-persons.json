    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order and efficiency. It emphasizes economy and orderly administration, suggesting a desire to instill confidence and perhaps a mild sense of relief that things are being streamlined. There's no indication of wanting to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild element, as the order introduces a new system, but it's not the primary goal. Therefore, I'll score joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust as 1, and surprise as 2, to reflect the very slight element of novelty.",
