    "critique": "The document expresses concern and dissatisfaction with FEMA's current performance, particularly its efficacy, priorities, and competence in disaster response. It highlights concerns of political bias and mission focus. The president aims to convey a sense of urgency and determination to improve FEMA's operations and ensure impartial and effective disaster response. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed are sadness (due to the current state of FEMA), disgust (at the alleged political bias), and a hint of surprise (at the extent of the problems). There's also an element of hope that the new council will bring positive change. The intensity of these emotions would likely be felt moderately by the American public, especially those affected by disasters or concerned about government efficiency and fairness.",
