The primary emotion conveyed is one of support and justification for this action, given her husband's disability and near eligibility for a disability annuity. There is a hint of sadness related to Mr. Bennett's disability, but it is not the main focus. There is no indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.",
