    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the order of succession for the Secretary of State. It is a legal and administrative document, and therefore it is unlikely to convey strong emotions to the American public. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of surprise due to the specific nature of the document, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Most people will likely not have any emotional response. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions.",
