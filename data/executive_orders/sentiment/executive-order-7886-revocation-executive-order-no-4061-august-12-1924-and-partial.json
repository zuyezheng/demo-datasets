    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that revokes two previous executive orders related to land surveys in New Mexico. The language is formal and factual, and the order itself is administrative in nature. Therefore, the order is not designed to evoke any particular emotion in the audience. The initial scores for all emotions should be very low. Upon review, I confirm that the executive order is unlikely to evoke any strong emotions. The revised scores remain very low.",
