    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration from the President. It invokes legal authority and suspends a provision of the United States Code. There is no explicit emotional language used. The context suggests a serious, official action, but doesn't inherently convey any specific emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, as the public is unlikely to feel any of these emotions strongly based on this document alone. I will give a score of 1 for each emotion.",
