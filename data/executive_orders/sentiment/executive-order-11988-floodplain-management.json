    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding floodplain management. It is a formal and legal document. The president is conveying a sense of responsibility and determination to protect citizens and the environment from flood risks. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a mild sense of concern and resolve can be inferred. Therefore, I will assign low scores to sadness, fear, and disgust, and a slightly higher score to joy (due to the positive impact of the order) and surprise (due to the potential changes it may bring).",
