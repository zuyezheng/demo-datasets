    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order revokes a previous executive order related to customs collection districts. It's unlikely to make people feel intense joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The most likely emotion might be a mild surprise that such an order is being issued, but even that is a stretch. Therefore, I will score all emotions as very low.",
