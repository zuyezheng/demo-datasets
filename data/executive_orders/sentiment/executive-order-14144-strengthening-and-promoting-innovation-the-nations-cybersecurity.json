    "critique": "The executive order is primarily focused on cybersecurity and national security. The main emotion the president likely wants to convey is a sense of urgency and concern regarding the threats facing the United States, but also confidence that the government is taking action to address these threats. Therefore, I will score fear and surprise relatively high, and joy and sadness relatively low. Disgust might be present due to the actions of adversarial countries and criminals, but it's not the primary emotion. The order aims to instill confidence through action, so I will adjust the scores accordingly.",
