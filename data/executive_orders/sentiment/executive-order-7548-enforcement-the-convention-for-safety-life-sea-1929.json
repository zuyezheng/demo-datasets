    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the responsibilities of various government departments in fulfilling the Safety of Life at Sea Convention. It is primarily informational and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The tone is serious and official, aiming for clarity and compliance. Therefore, the expected emotional response is minimal. There might be a slight sense of reassurance or confidence due to the clear assignment of responsibilities, but this is not a primary goal of the document.",
