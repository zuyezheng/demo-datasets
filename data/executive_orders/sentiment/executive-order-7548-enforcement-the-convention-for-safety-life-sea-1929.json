    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding the implementation of the Safety of Life at Sea Convention. It primarily focuses on assigning responsibilities to different government departments. There is a sense of duty and importance, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise are not really present. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
