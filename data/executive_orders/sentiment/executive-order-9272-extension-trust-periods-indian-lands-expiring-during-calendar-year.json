    "critique": "The document is a formal order extending trust periods for Indian lands. It's a legal and administrative document, so strong emotions are unlikely. There might be a slight sense of hope or relief (joy) for the Native American tribes affected, but it's very subtle. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign low scores to all emotions, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
