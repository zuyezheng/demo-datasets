It outlines the order in which officers of the Department of Homeland Security will perform the functions of the Secretary in the event that the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and other designated officers are unable to do so. There is no obvious attempt to evoke any particular emotion from the reader. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
