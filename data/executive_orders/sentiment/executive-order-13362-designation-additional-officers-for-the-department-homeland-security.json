    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order detailing the line of succession for the Secretary of Homeland Security. It is a legal document, and as such, it is expected to be neutral in tone. There is no indication of strong emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and procedural. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon review, the initial scores accurately reflect the document's neutral tone, so the revised scores will remain the same.",
