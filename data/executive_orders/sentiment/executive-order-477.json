    "critique": "The executive order is a formal recognition of the services of Brigadier-General Nathaniel Lyon and the soldiers under his command. The primary emotion conveyed should be joy and pride in their service and victory, with a touch of sadness for the loss of General Lyon. There might be a slight element of surprise at the recognition, but it's not a dominant emotion. Disgust, fear, and anger are not intended emotions.",
