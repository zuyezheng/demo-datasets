The language is legal and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a slight sense of joy or satisfaction that natural resources are being protected, but this would be very mild. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
