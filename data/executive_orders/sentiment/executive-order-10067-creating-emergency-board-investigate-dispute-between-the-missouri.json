    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order creating a board to investigate a dispute between a railroad company and its employees. The language is legal and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the implicit emotions are: sadness (due to the dispute and potential disruption of transportation), fear (of the consequences of the dispute), and surprise (that the dispute has reached this level). The intensity of these emotions is relatively low, as the document focuses on addressing the situation rather than expressing feelings. Therefore, I will assign low scores to sadness, fear, and surprise, and a score of 1 to joy and disgust, as these emotions are not relevant to the document.",
