    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration regarding employment in the Canal Zone during wartime. It invokes legal authority and states a suspension of certain provisions. The language is formal and legalistic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. The initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions. Upon review, the order might evoke a very mild sense of surprise due to the suspension of provisions, so the surprise score is adjusted to 2.",
