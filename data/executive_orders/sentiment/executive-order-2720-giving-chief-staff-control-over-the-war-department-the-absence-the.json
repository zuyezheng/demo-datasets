    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative procedure. It authorizes the Chief of Staff to perform the duties of Secretary of War during the Secretary's absence, especially when the Assistant Secretary is also absent. There's no apparent intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to ensure the continuity of operations within the War Department. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
