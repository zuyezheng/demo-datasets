    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a technical document related to civil service and personnel matters. It modifies a previous executive order to waive a limitation for a specific individual, Reginald C. Price. The language is formal and legalistic, and the content is specific and procedural. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel any strong emotions after reading this document. The primary goal is to communicate a legal change and ensure proper record-keeping. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a very low level of emotional conveyance. Upon further reflection, it seems even a score of 1 might be too high, as the document is intended to be purely informational and procedural, with no emotional appeal. Therefore, I will revise the scores to 1 across the board to reflect the lack of intended emotional impact.",
