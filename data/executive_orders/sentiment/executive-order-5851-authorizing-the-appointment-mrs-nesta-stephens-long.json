    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the appointment of Mrs. Nesta Stephens Long. It primarily conveys information about a personnel decision. There is a hint of sadness due to Mr. Long's illness, but the overall tone is neutral and administrative. Therefore, joy, fear, disgust, and surprise should be scored low. Sadness should be slightly higher due to the mention of illness.",
