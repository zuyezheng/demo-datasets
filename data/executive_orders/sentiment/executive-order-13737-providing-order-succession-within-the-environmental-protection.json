    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the order of succession within the Environmental Protection Agency. It is a formal and legal document. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the American public. The primary emotions that might be conveyed are a mild sense of surprise (due to the change in order) and perhaps a touch of disgust or sadness depending on one's views of the EPA. However, these would be very mild. Most people will likely not have any emotional response.",
