    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim to convey a sense of urgency and concern regarding the potential impact of the labor disputes on national health and safety. It invokes authority and establishes a Board of Inquiry to address the issues. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are concern (leading to a degree of fear) and a sense of decisive action (potentially inspiring a bit of joy or relief that the situation is being handled). There might also be a hint of disgust at the situation that has arisen, disrupting the flow of essential goods. Surprise is less relevant here, as the order is a response to a known situation.",
