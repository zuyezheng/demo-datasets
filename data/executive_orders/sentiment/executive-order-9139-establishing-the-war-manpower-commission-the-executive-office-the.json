It establishes the War Manpower Commission and outlines its responsibilities and authority. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on organization, coordination, and efficiency. There is a sense of urgency and determination to effectively manage resources for the war effort. Given the context, the primary emotions conveyed are related to the seriousness of the situation and the need for decisive action.
