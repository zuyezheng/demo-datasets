    "critique": "The document describes the appointment of Mrs. Germaine M. Finley to a position in the classified service. The context is that she is the widow of a former Consular Service member who died, leaving her with two young children and without means of support. The language is formal and sympathetic.The president is conveying sadness and perhaps a touch of surprise at the circumstances, but overall, the document seems intended to evoke a sense of compassion and support for Mrs. Finley. Therefore, sadness should be the highest score, followed by a lower score for surprise. There's no indication of joy, anger, fear, or disgust.",
