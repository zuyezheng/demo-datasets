    "critique": "The document expresses the president's disapproval of the Secretary of War's plan to return captured flags. The tone is formal and direct, focusing on legal and procedural concerns rather than emotional expression. There's a hint of disapproval or disagreement, but it's primarily a matter of policy. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on sadness and disgust due to the disapproval.",
