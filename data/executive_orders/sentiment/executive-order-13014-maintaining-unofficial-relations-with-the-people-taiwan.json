    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding relations with Taiwan. It primarily deals with legal and administrative matters following the recognition of the People's Republic of China. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, reflecting the document's neutral tone and specific legal focus.I will set all initial scores to 1.",
