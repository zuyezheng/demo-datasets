    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that aims to maintain commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people of the United States and the people on Taiwan. It delegates and reserves functions, specifies laws and determinations, and generally provides a framework for these relations. The primary emotions the president wants to convey are a sense of stability, reassurance, and confidence in the continuation of these relations. There is a mild sense of surprise that this order is being issued, but overall the goal is to maintain the status quo.",
