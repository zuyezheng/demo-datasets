    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a wildlife refuge. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and purpose, with an underlying tone of conservation. There's a hint of potential fear or disgust directed towards those who might harm the refuge, but it's not the dominant emotion. Joy and surprise are not really present. I will score it accordingly.",
