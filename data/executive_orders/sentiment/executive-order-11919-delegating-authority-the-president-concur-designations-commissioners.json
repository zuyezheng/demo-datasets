    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order. It primarily concerns the designation of the Attorney General as the President's representative for specific duties related to the Parole Commission. Given the formal and administrative nature of the document, the emotional intensity is expected to be low across all emotions. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion.",
