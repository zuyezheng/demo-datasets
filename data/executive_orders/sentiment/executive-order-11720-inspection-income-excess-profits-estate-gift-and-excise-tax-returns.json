    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that authorizes the Senate Committee on Commerce to inspect tax returns for the years 1939 to 1974. The purpose is to investigate the effects of organized criminal activity on interstate and foreign commerce. The order itself is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. It is a legal and administrative document. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, but there might be a slight sense of surprise or concern that such an order is necessary, so I will adjust those scores slightly.",
