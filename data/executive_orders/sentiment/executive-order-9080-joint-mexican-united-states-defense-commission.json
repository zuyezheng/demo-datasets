It establishes a joint commission for defense, suggesting a proactive approach to protect both the United States and Mexico. The tone is formal and official, emphasizing the importance and seriousness of the matter. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be a sense of security and perhaps mild surprise at the collaboration.",
