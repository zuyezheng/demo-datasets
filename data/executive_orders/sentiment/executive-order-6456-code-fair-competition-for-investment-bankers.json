    "critique": "The executive order seems formal and procedural. It aims to convey a sense of order, compliance, and governmental action rather than strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of reassurance or confidence in the government's ability to manage the economy, but it's very subtle. Therefore, I will score joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all as 1 initially. After reflection, I will keep the scores the same, as the document does not strongly evoke any of these emotions.",
