    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action related to employment at the Bureau of Printing and Engraving. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a slight sense of surprise that such a specific order is being issued, but even that is minimal. Therefore, all emotions are scored very low initially. After further consideration, the order is unlikely to evoke any emotions, so all scores are revised to 1.",
