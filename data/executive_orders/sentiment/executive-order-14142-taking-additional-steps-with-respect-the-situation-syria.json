    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of decisive action and authority while addressing a complex situation. It seeks to reassure the audience that the government is responding to changing circumstances in Syria. The order itself is very legal and procedural, so it does not lend itself to strong emotions. However, the order could instill a small amount of joy in people who support the president and his policies. It could instill a small amount of fear and disgust in those who do not support the president's policies.",
