    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order detailing the approval of a new seal for the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). The language is very formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotional language. The order aims to convey authority, stability, and confidence in the NCUA. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be low. The description of the seal elements does evoke a sense of pride and strength, but it's very subtle.",
