    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the approval of a new seal for the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). The language is formal and legalistic, with a focus on describing the elements of the seal and the authority for its adoption. There is no strong emotional sentiment conveyed in the document. The most relevant emotions might be a mild sense of joy or pride in the NCUA's mission and history, but these are very subtle. Therefore, the initial scores are set to low values across all emotions.",
