    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding pay adjustments for various government employees and officials. It is a formal and legal document. The language is neutral and factual, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal. Most people would likely not have a strong reaction. The order is unlikely to evoke strong feelings of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
