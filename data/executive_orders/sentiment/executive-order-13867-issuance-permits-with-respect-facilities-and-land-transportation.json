    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to streamline the process for issuing Presidential permits for cross-border infrastructure projects. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a slight hint of joy in promoting economic development and fostering goodwill, but it's very subtle. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
