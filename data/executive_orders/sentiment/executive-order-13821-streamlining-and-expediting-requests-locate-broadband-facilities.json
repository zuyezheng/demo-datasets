    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on improving broadband access in rural America. It aims to address the lack of reliable and affordable internet service, which hinders economic prosperity and access to essential services. The language is formal and policy-oriented, with a focus on efficiency and implementation. There is a sense of purpose and determination to improve the situation, but no strong emotions are explicitly expressed. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with slightly elevated scores for joy and surprise due to the positive impact of improved broadband access and the novelty of the initiative, respectively. The other emotions should be scored low.",
