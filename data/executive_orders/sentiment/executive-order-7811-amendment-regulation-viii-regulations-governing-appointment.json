    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a technical amendment to civil service regulations. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue it aims to provide a sense of stability and order (reducing fear/uncertainty) and perhaps a little bit of satisfaction (joy) for those affected by the amendment. The order itself is very dry and formal, so the intensity of any emotion is likely to be very low.",
