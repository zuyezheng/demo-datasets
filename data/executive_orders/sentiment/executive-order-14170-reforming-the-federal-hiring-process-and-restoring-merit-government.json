It also attempts to instill a sense of disgust and anger towards the current hiring practices, which are described as 'broken, insular, and outdated.' Additionally, there might be a subtle element of fear conveyed regarding the potential risks of current practices. Surprise is not a primary emotion the order seeks to convey.",
