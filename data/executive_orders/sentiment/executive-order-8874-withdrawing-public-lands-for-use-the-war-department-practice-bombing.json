    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order withdrawing public lands for use as a practice bombing range. It is a factual declaration with no explicit emotional content. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After further consideration, I still believe that the document is primarily factual and devoid of strong emotional expression. The revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
