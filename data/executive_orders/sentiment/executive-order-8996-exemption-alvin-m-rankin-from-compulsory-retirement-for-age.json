    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and stability during a time of potential uncertainty (December 26, 1941). The act of exempting Alvin M. Rankin from compulsory retirement could be interpreted as a measure to retain experienced personnel, which might evoke a sense of security and perhaps mild joy that the president is taking care of the workforce. There's no strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise might be a very mild element, as the audience might not expect such a specific order.",
