    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and determination to enforce the National Industrial Recovery Act. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also not a prominent emotion. The language is legal and procedural, aimed at ensuring compliance. Therefore, the initial scores should reflect this neutrality, with low values for all emotions except perhaps a slightly elevated sense of determination which might be interpreted as a low level of joy or surprise that the act is being enforced.",
