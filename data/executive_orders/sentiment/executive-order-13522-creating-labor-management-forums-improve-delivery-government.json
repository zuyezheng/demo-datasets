    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish a cooperative and productive form of labor-management relations throughout the executive branch. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of optimism and hope for improved government services and employee relations, but it is conveyed in a measured and professional tone. Therefore, joy, surprise, sadness, disgust, and fear should be scored low, while focusing on the intent to improve productivity and effectiveness.",
