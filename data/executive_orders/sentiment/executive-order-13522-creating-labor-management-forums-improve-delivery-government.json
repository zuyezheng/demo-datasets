    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish a cooperative and productive form of labor-management relations. The language is formal and legalistic. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of optimism and hope for improved labor relations, but it's very subdued. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order seems to promote joy and reduce anger, fear, and disgust indirectly. Surprise is not relevant here. The scores should reflect the subtle nature of the emotions conveyed.",
