The primary emotion the president wants to convey is joy, stemming from the anticipated improvements in government services and employee satisfaction. There might be a hint of surprise at the innovative approaches to labor-management relations, but it's not a dominant emotion. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
