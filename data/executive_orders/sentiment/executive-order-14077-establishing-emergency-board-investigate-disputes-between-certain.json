    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on informing and directing actions related to a labor dispute. It doesn't explicitly try to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a subtle undercurrent of concern or seriousness given the potential disruption to interstate commerce. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with low values for most emotions and a slightly higher value for concern/fear. After further consideration, I've slightly adjusted the scores to better reflect the potential for concern, while still maintaining the overall neutral tone.",
