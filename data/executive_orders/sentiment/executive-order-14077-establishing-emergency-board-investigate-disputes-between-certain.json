    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute in the railroad industry. The language is legalistic and factual, with no overt expression of emotion. The President is acting in an official capacity to prevent disruption to interstate commerce. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal, with perhaps a slight sense of relief that the situation is being addressed. Considering that, I will assign low scores across all emotions.",
