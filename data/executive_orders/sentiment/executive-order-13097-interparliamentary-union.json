    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of the Interparliamentary Union as a public international organization. The language is legal and procedural. There is no indication of strong emotions. A baseline of 1 is appropriate for most emotions, as the document aims for neutrality. There might be a slight sense of formality which could be interpreted as a very mild sense of joy that the designation is being made, but it's minimal.",
