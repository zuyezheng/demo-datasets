    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and obligation, but doesn't express emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is legal and procedural, focusing on defining terms, setting requirements, and delegating authority. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with perhaps a slight emphasis on obligation or seriousness.",
