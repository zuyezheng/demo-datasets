    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the existence of a labor dispute and the establishment of a board to investigate it. It doesn't seem to intentionally evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and procedural, suggesting a desire for objectivity and resolution rather than emotional response. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be very low. Upon further reflection, the order might evoke a slight sense of reassurance or relief that the government is taking action to address a potentially disruptive situation. This could translate to a very minimal level of joy or reduced fear/surprise. However, the overall emotional impact remains minimal.",
