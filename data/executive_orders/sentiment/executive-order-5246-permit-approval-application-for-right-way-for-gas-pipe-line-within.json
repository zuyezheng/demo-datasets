    "critique": "The executive order is a modification to a previous order regarding a power site reserve in Utah. It authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to approve an application for a right of way for a pipe line. This order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most relevant emotion might be a slight sense of surprise that such a specific modification is being addressed at the executive level, but the intensity would be very low. There's no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
