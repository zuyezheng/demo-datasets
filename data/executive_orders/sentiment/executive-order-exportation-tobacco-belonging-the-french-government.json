    "critique": "The document is a formal statement regarding the export of tobacco. It primarily conveys a sense of resolution and agreement after a misunderstanding. There is no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and factual. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, the tone is still very neutral, so the initial scores are appropriate.",
