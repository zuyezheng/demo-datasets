    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the establishment and awarding of the Presidential Service Certificate and Badge. It outlines the criteria for eligibility, the awarding process, and other administrative details. The language is formal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal. Given the lack of emotional content, the initial scores are set to 1 for all emotions. After further consideration, the initial scores remain appropriate as the document is purely administrative and lacks any emotional appeal.",
