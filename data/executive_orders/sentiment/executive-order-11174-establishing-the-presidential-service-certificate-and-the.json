    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of respect, honor, and tradition. It focuses on recognizing service within the White House and doesn't seem to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of pride or respect for the individuals being recognized, but it's not a dominant emotion. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. Revised scores reflect a slightly increased sense of respect and honor.",
