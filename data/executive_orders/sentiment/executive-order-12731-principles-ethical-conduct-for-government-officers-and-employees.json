    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing ethical conduct standards for executive branch employees. It aims to ensure public confidence in the government's integrity. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on principles, responsibilities, and delegations of authority. There is a sense of duty and commitment to ethical governance, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slight emphasis on the intention to inspire confidence and trust.",
