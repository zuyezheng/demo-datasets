It should evoke a sense of trust and security, not necessarily strong emotions like joy or sadness. The primary emotion should be a sense of calm assurance and perhaps a bit of surprise that such measures are being taken to ensure ethical conduct. There might be a slight element of disgust directed towards unethical behavior, but it's not the main focus.",
