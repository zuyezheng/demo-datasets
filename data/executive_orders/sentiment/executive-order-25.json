    "critique": "The executive order seems to be conveying a sense of seriousness and authority. The order is forbidding government employees from soliciting pay increases or influencing legislation, which could evoke feelings of fear or respect for the rules. There might be a hint of sadness for those who feel restricted by the order, but overall, the dominant emotions are fear and perhaps a little surprise at the strictness. The initial scores reflect this, but the revised scores slightly increase the fear and reduce the surprise after further consideration.",
