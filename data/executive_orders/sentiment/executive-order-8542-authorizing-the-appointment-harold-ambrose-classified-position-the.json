    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about appointing someone to a classified position, which doesn't typically elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon further reflection, there might be a very slight sense of surprise due to the specific nature of the appointment, but it would be minimal. The revised scores should reflect this slight adjustment.",
