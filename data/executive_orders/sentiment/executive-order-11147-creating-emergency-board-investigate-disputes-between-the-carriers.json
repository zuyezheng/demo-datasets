Therefore, the emotions conveyed should be concern (to highlight the importance of the issue) and reassurance (to show that the situation is being handled). There is no intention to evoke joy, disgust, or strong surprise. Fear and sadness might be subtly present due to the potential disruption of services, but they are not the main focus.",
