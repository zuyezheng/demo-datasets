    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding the World Trade Organization. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and official implementation of international agreements. There is no strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and legalistic. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for authority which can be interpreted as a low level of joy or perhaps surprise at the implementation.",
