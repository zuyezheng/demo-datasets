    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and public interest rather than strong emotional responses. Joy might be a slight positive emotion due to the park's establishment, but overall, the emotions are quite muted. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy. The revised scores further tone down the emotional impact, recognizing the document's primary goal is administrative rather than emotional.",
