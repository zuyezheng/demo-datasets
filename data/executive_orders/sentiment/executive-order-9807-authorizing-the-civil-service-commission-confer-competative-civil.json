    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document conferring civil service status upon certain employees. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue it aims to inspire a sense of joy in those who benefit from the order, and perhaps a mild sense of surprise that such an order was issued. The order seems to be very formal and unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
