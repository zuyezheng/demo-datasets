    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to Brevet Major-General Lorenzo Thomas, instructing him to take over as Secretary of War ad interim after the removal of Edwin M. Stanton. The language is formal and direct, without any explicit emotional expression. However, the context of removing a cabinet member could imply underlying emotions. Given the lack of explicit emotional cues, the scores should be low, with a slight emphasis on surprise due to the unexpected nature of a cabinet member's removal.",
