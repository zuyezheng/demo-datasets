    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to the Adjutant-General, informing him of his temporary appointment as Secretary of War. The language is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the removal of Edwin M. Stanton, though not directly stated with emotion, could imply some level of surprise or perhaps even a hint of underlying tension or conflict. Given the formal nature, the emotional intensity is likely low across the board. I will assign a baseline score of 1 for most emotions, with a slightly higher score for surprise due to the unexpected nature of the appointment.",
