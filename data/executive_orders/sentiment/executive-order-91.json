    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the administration of Cuba and other West Indies islands. It primarily focuses on establishing administrative roles and maintaining governance. There is no explicit emotional language or sentiment expressed in the document. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be neutral. The initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions due to the lack of emotional content. After further consideration, the revised scores remain at 1, as the document's purpose is purely administrative and does not evoke any specific emotion.",
