    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It designates an acting judge for the District Court of the United States for Puerto Rico. The order does not seem to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of surprise that such an action is necessary, but the intensity would be very low. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
