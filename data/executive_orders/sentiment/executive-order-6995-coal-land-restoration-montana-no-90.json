    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document that revokes previous orders related to land withdrawal. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal seems to be informational and legal, rather than emotional. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. I will set joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise all to 1 initially. Upon further reflection, the act of revoking land withdrawals might bring a slight sense of surprise to those familiar with the previous orders, so I will adjust the surprise score to 2.",
