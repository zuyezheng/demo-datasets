    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining emergency preparedness measures. It aims to instill a sense of preparedness and confidence in the government's ability to handle crises. Therefore, the primary emotion it should convey is a sense of calm and readiness, not strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a secondary emotion might be a mild sense of reassurance or confidence.",
