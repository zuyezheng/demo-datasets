The order is about inducting men into the land forces, which might cause some fear or sadness, but it's primarily a directive. The initial scores reflect a moderate level of fear and sadness, with low levels of other emotions. The revised scores are slightly adjusted to reflect a more neutral stance, with a slight increase in fear due to the nature of the order.",
