    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate disputes between railroads and their employees. The language is legal and procedural. There is a sense of urgency due to the potential disruption of interstate commerce, but the overall tone is neutral and objective. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Considering the potential negative impact of interrupted interstate commerce, a slightly elevated fear score seems appropriate. There's no explicit joy, sadness, disgust, or surprise conveyed in the document.",
