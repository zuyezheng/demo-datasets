    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the closure of government offices to honor the late Secretary of State. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the passing of a respected figure. There might be a sense of respect and solemnity, but other emotions like joy, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are not evident. The intensity of sadness is moderate, as it's a formal announcement rather than a personal expression of grief. Therefore, I will assign a score of 6 for sadness and 1 for all other emotions.",
