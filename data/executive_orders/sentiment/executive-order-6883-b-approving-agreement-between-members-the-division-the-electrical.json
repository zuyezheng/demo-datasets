    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of confidence and stability. The order is very formal and procedural, suggesting a desire to convey a sense of order and control. There isn't a strong emphasis on any particular emotion, but a subtle sense of reassurance might be intended. The initial scores reflect this, with low values across the board. The revised scores slightly increase the 'joy' and decrease the 'fear' to reflect the subtle sense of reassurance.",
