    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of an agreement related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The language is legal and bureaucratic, not designed to evoke strong emotions. The president is conveying a sense of duty and approval, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy as the document approves an agreement.",
