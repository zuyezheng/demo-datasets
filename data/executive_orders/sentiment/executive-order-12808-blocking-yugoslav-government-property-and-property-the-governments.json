It aims to convey a sense of seriousness and resolve rather than specific emotions like joy, sadness, or surprise. The primary emotion is arguably fear (for national security) and disgust (at the actions prompting the order), but these are presented in a controlled, formal manner. The order is designed to instill confidence that the situation is being handled decisively.",
