    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order. It permits federal employees to hold teaching positions in state, territorial, or municipal schools, provided it doesn't interfere with their federal duties. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a slight sense of joy could be present due to the expansion of opportunities for federal employees. There is no indication of sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores are set accordingly, with a low joy score and the other emotions set to 1. After a second thought, the document is purely informational and formal, so there is no emotion conveyed.",
