    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Retail Trade. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of authority and decisiveness, but not necessarily any strong emotion. The public is expected to feel a mild sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's actions, but not intense emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low across all emotions. After further consideration, I realized that the document is intended to inspire confidence and optimism, so I will revise the joy score to reflect that.",
