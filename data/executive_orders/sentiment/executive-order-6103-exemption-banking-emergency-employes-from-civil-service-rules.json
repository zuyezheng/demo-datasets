    "critique": "The document discusses emergency appointments in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It's a formal announcement related to a specific legal provision during a national emergency. There is no explicit or implicit emotional expression in the document. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low. Since the document mentions a national emergency, there might be a slight sense of concern or seriousness, but it's not strongly emphasized. Therefore, I will give a score of 2 to fear and 1 to the rest of the emotions.",
