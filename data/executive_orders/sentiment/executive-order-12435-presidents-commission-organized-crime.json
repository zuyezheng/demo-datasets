    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to combat organized crime. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the implicit emotions conveyed might include a sense of determination (to combat crime) and perhaps a subtle sense of concern (about the problem of organized crime). Given the formal nature, the intensity of these emotions is likely to be perceived as low by the public. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for fear and determination (which could be interpreted as a low level of joy in taking action).",
