    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding land resurvey in Wyoming. It primarily concerns legal and administrative matters. There is no explicit emotional expression in the document. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of strong emotional conveyance. Considering it is a formal document, I will assign a baseline score of 1 for all emotions to indicate a minimal level of formality and neutrality.",
