    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of neutrality and official procedure. There's a slight hint of joy as it relates to giving federal employees time off before Christmas, but it's very subdued. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this, with joy being slightly above 1 and all other emotions at 1.",
