    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine military order, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is transferring command of the Department of the East from Brigadier and Brevet Major-General Irvin McDowell. The order also states that the department will be transferred from Philadelphia to New York City. These actions do not seem to be designed to evoke any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1. After further consideration, I still believe that the executive order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. Therefore, the revised scores for all emotions remain at 1.",
