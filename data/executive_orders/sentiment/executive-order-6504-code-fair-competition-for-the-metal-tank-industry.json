    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Metal Tank Industry. The language is legal and bureaucratic, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment, but not in an overtly emotional way. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After a second thought, the document is intended to convey a sense of progress and optimism, so I will adjust the joy score slightly upwards.",
