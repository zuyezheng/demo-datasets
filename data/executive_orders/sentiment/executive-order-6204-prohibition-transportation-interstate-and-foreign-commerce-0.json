    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's actions during a time of economic recovery. It focuses on the intent and purpose of Congress, securing enforcement, and authorizing the Secretary of the Interior. The order does not seem to want the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Instead, it conveys a sense of determination and resolve. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
