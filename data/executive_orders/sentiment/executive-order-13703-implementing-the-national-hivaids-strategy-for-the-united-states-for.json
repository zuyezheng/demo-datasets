    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order outlining the implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. It focuses on coordination, collaboration, and accountability across federal agencies to improve health outcomes for Americans at risk for or living with HIV/AIDS. The language is formal and policy-oriented. There is a sense of optimism and determination to address the issue, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores are relatively low across all emotions. I will revise the scores to reflect the underlying sense of optimism and determination, while still maintaining the overall formal and neutral tone of the document.",
