    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, legal document. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about the Civil Service Commission and the heads of executive departments being authorized to issue regulations or instructions governing the permanency of promotions and reassignments of permanent employees. It seems like the order is trying to convey a sense of stability and order. Therefore, I will score it as follows: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1.",
