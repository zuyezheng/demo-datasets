    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document detailing the specifications for the US flag following Alaska's admission to the Union. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy or pride related to the addition of a new state, but the technical nature of the order would temper this. There's no reason for sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is possible, but unlikely, unless someone is particularly interested in the details of flag specifications.",
