    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Iron and Steel Industry. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal, as the document is primarily informational. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, while the document itself doesn't express strong emotions, the act of approving the code could be seen as a positive step towards economic recovery, potentially eliciting a slight sense of joy or relief. However, the primary function of the document is to inform, not to evoke emotion.",
