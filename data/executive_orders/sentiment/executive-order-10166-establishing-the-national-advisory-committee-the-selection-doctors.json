    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement, so it should not convey strong emotions. The order establishes a committee and outlines its responsibilities. It aims to convey a sense of order and importance, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low across all emotions. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, but there might be a slight sense of surprise due to the establishment of a new committee.",
