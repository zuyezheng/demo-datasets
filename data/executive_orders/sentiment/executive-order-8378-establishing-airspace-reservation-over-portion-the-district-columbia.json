    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an airspace reservation for national defense, governmental purposes, and public safety. The language is legalistic and technical, focusing on precise geographical descriptions and regulations. There is no explicit emotional appeal or sentiment expressed in the document. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. I will assign a low score of 1 for all emotions initially, as the document is primarily informational and regulatory, not designed to evoke any particular emotion. After further consideration, the document's purpose is to ensure public safety and national defense, which might evoke a slight sense of security or reduced fear. However, since the document is very technical and formal, the emotional impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I will keep the scores at 1 for all emotions.",
