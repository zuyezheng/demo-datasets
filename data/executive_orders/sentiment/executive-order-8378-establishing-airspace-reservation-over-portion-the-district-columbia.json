    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that establishes an airspace reservation for national defense, governmental purposes, and public safety. The order itself is factual and technical, focusing on specific geographic coordinates and regulations. It aims to ensure safety and security, but it doesn't explicitly try to evoke any particular emotion. However, the underlying purpose of the order, which is national defense and public safety, might implicitly aim to instill a sense of security and perhaps mild surprise at the level of detail. Therefore, I will score surprise as a 3 and the rest as 1.",
