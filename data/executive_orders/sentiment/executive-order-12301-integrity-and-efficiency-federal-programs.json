    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency. The language is formal and bureaucratic. The purpose is to coordinate and implement government policies with respect to integrity and efficiency in Federal programs. There is no strong emotion conveyed in the document. A slight sense of joy might be perceived due to the positive implications of integrity and efficiency, but it is very mild. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
