    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration by President Roosevelt regarding the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Motion Picture Industry. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, focusing on compliance, authority, and specific conditions. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The tone is official and procedural. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional content.",
