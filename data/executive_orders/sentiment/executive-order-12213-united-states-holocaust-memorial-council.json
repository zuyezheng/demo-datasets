    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that amends a previous order related to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. The order itself doesn't express emotions directly, but it aims to ensure the council can continue its important work. The primary emotions the order might evoke are related to the subject matter of the Holocaust, which could include sadness and perhaps a sense of solemnity or respect. However, the order itself is more about administrative function than directly eliciting those emotions. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low, focusing on the underlying somber nature of the topic.",
