    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order amending a previous order regarding the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. The language is legal and procedural. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a slight sense of importance and seriousness might be present. Therefore, I will assign low scores to sadness, fear, and disgust, and slightly higher scores to joy and surprise, but overall, the scores will be low to reflect the formal and unemotional nature of the document.",
