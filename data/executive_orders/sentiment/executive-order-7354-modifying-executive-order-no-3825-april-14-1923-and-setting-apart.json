    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that modifies a previous order to allow the Alaska Road Commission to use a townsite lot for airport purposes. The language is formal and specific, focusing on the legal and practical aspects of the land use change. There is no intention to evoke strong emotions in the audience. The primary goal is to communicate the change in land use designation clearly and unambiguously. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be very low, as the document is not designed to elicit any particular emotional response.",
