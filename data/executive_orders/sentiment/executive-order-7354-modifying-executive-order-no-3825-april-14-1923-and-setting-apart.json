It's a legal and administrative document, so the emotional content is expected to be minimal. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document is purely functional and directive. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional expression.",
