    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding government operations. It primarily conveys a sense of administrative action and does not strongly evoke any particular emotion. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on dates, sections, and amendments. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After further consideration, the document is still formal and bureaucratic, so the initial scores are appropriate.",
