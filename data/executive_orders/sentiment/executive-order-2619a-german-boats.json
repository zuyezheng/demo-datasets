    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a declaration of taking possession of German vessels. The primary emotion conveyed would likely be surprise, as it's an unexpected action. There might also be a sense of fear or anger directed towards the German vessels, but surprise seems to be the most prominent emotion. After further consideration, the order is a declaration of power and control, so fear is a more appropriate emotion to focus on.",
