    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding disaster relief. It aims to improve the delivery of federal disaster assistance. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is a sense of responsibility and determination to improve the system. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a mild sense of hope and determination can be interpreted. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy, and sadness, and very low scores to fear, disgust, and surprise.",
