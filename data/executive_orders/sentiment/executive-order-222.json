    "critique": "The document is a formal letter from the United States Civil Service Commission to the President, recommending an amendment to an order regarding noncompetitive examinations. The language is formal and respectful. There is no strong emotion conveyed in the document. The primary purpose is to inform and recommend, not to evoke any particular emotion. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. The approval by Grover Cleveland at the end doesn't change the emotional tone of the original document.",
