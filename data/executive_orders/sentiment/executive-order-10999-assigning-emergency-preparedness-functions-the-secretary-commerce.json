    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining the responsibilities of the Secretary of Commerce in the event of a national emergency. The order aims to convey a sense of preparedness and control, but also acknowledges the potential for fear and disruption in such a scenario. The primary emotions the president wants to convey are a sense of preparedness (low joy), acknowledgement of potential fear, and a call to action to prevent disgust. Surprise is not really relevant here.",
