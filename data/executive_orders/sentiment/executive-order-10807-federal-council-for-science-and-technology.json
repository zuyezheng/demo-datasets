It seeks to instill confidence and optimism in the government's ability to address challenges and improve the lives of citizens through coordinated efforts in science and technology. The order does not explicitly aim to evoke negative emotions such as sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is not a primary goal, but a sense of innovation and forward-thinking might elicit a mild sense of surprise.",
