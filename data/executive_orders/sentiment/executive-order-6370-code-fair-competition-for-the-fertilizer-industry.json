    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Fertilizer Industry by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The language is legal and administrative, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the act of approving such a code could be interpreted as conveying a sense of optimism and progress (joy) for the industry and the nation. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, I will assign a low score to joy and a score of 1 to the other emotions due to lack of information.",
