    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement about civil service status for employees of the Office of Indian Affairs. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. Perhaps a tiny bit of joy that the employees are getting civil service status and a tiny bit of surprise that the order is being issued. The order is very procedural, so I will set all the emotions to 1, except joy and surprise which I will set to 2.",
