    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish an Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council to improve mobility for transportation-disadvantaged individuals. The language is formal and legalistic, with no overt emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. After further consideration, the document does convey a sense of joy and hope for the transportation-disadvantaged, and a slight sense of surprise that such an order is being issued. The revised scores reflect this.",
