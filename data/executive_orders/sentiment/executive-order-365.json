    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the Treasury Department, abolishing civil-service rules and transferring responsibilities. The language is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the abolishment of existing rules and transfer of duties might implicitly convey a sense of surprise or concern among those affected. Considering the formal nature and lack of overt emotional cues, the scores should be low, with a slight consideration for surprise and perhaps a hint of sadness due to potential job changes.",
