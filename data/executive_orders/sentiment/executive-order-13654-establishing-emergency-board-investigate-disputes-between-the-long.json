    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the establishment and responsibilities of an emergency board to address disputes. It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, intended to convey authority and process rather than emotional sentiment. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values. Upon further reflection, while the primary goal isn't to evoke emotion, there might be a subtle element of reassurance or relief conveyed by the order, suggesting a low level of joy or hope that the disputes will be resolved. Also, a very mild sense of surprise because of the establishment of the board.",
