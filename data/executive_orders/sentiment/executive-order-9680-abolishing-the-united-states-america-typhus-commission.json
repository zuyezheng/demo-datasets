    "critique": "The executive order is about abolishing the United States of America Typhus Commission. The order is formal and factual. It aims to inform the public about the end of the commission and the transfer of its responsibilities. The intended emotions are relief (joy) that the commission's work is done and perhaps a bit of sadness that it is ending. There might be a touch of surprise that it is ending. Disgust, fear, and anger are not relevant.",
