    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of control and authority, but not necessarily to evoke strong emotions. It's more about establishing procedures and delegating authority. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across the board. The order is formal and legalistic, so it's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, there might be a slight sense of reassurance or confidence that the government is taking action, so I'll give a small score for joy. There might also be a very mild sense of surprise that such an order is being issued, but it's minimal.",
