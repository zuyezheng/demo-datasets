The primary emotion the president wants to convey is a sense of security and confidence in the government's ability to protect its citizens and infrastructure. There might be a touch of surprise to highlight the proactive nature of the order, but it's not the main focus. There is no intention to make the audience feel disgust, fear, joy, or sadness.",
