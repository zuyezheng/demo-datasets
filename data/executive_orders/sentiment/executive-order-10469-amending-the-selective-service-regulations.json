    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of order and clarity, with no strong emotional appeal. The order is very formal and procedural. Therefore, I would expect low scores for all emotions. My initial scores are: disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 1. After further consideration, I think the order might evoke a slight sense of relief or security for those who are affected by the amendment. Therefore, I will increase the joy score slightly.",
