    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to address economic development challenges in the Southwest Border region. The language is formal and bureaucratic, focusing on establishing a task force, defining its purpose, and outlining reporting requirements. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue that the order implicitly conveys a sense of hope or optimism regarding the potential for economic improvement in the region, although this is not stated directly. Considering the lack of emotional language, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. After revision, I will keep the scores low, but slightly increase the 'joy' score to reflect the implicit hope for economic improvement.",
