    "critique": "The document is a formal order from President Roosevelt regarding amendments to the Code of Fair Competition for the Automobile Manufacturing Industry. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is a sense of authority and decisiveness, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. I will assign low scores across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive impact of fair competition and labor standards.",
