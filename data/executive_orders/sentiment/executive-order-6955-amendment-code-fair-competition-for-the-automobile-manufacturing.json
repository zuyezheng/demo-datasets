It extends the expiration date, addresses overtime pay, encourages industry agreements for employment regularization, and confirms labor dispute settlement provisions. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, with a secondary element of surprise due to the changes. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
