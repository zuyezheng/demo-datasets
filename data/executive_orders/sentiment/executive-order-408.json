    "critique": "The executive order describes military achievements and orders gun salutes. The primary emotion conveyed should be joy and surprise at the victories. There might be a slight sense of fear or sadness for those who were lost, but the overall tone is celebratory. Disgust and anger are not relevant emotions in this context.The initial scores reflect this assessment, with joy and surprise being the highest, followed by slight fear and sadness. The revised scores slightly adjust the intensity of joy and surprise to better reflect the celebratory tone.",
