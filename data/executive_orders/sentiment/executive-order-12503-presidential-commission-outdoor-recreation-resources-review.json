    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a commission to review outdoor recreation resources. The language is legal and procedural, with no overt emotional expression. However, a subtle sense of joy might be inferred from the initiative to improve outdoor recreation for the American people. There is no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores will be low across the board, with a slightly higher score for joy.",
