    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, modifying the boundaries of a national forest and reserving the excluded land for town-site purposes. There's no indication of an intention to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue there might be a slight sense of joy for those who might benefit from the land being used for a town-site. There is no discernible sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise intended to be conveyed by this order.",
