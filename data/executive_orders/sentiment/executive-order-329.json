    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement regarding the closure of government departments for a specific purpose. The primary emotion it aims to evoke is a sense of respect and solemn remembrance for the soldiers who died during the rebellion. While it's not explicitly joyful, there's an underlying sense of honor and duty. Sadness is present due to the remembrance of fallen soldiers, but it's not overwhelming. There's no intention to evoke anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.The initial scores reflect these considerations, with sadness being the most prominent emotion, followed by a touch of joy (in the sense of honoring the fallen) and minimal levels of the other emotions. After further reflection, I realized that the element of surprise is not applicable here. The revised scores reflect a slight increase in sadness and a decrease in surprise.",
