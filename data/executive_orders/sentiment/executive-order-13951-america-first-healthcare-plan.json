    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of accomplishment and determination to improve healthcare. The President highlights past achievements and outlines future actions. There's a strong emphasis on positive outcomes like lower costs, better care, and more choices. While there's a mention of past failures (ACA), the overall tone is optimistic and forward-looking. Therefore, joy and surprise are the most prominent emotions, with a touch of determination to overcome challenges (reducing sadness/fear). Disgust and anger are less relevant.",
