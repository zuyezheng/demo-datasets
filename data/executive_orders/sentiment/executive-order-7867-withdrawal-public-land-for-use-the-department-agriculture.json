It primarily concerns legal and administrative actions related to land withdrawal and reservation for specific purposes. There is no explicit emotional expression in the document. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions. Considering it is a formal document, a baseline of 1 is appropriate where there isn't enough information.",
