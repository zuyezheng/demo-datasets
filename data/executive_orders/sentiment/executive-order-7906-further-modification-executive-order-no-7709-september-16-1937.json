    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the abolishment of the National Emergency Council. It primarily deals with administrative and legal matters. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and objective, typical of legal documents. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of strong emotional conveyance. Considering the formal nature of the document, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions due to the lack of explicit emotional content.",
