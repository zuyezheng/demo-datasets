    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, focusing on policy and amendments. There's no strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise being intentionally conveyed. The order appears to be a formal and legal document, prioritizing clarity and precision over emotional impact. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional presence.",
