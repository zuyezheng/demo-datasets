    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the extension of service for John W. Woermann. It doesn't express strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of duty or perhaps a hint of satisfaction in serving the public interest, but these are very subtle. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slightly higher score for 'joy' to reflect the positive outcome for Mr. Woermann.",
