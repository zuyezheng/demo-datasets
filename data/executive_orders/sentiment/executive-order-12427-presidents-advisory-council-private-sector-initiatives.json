    "critique": "The executive order seems formal and aims to establish an advisory council. It doesn't obviously evoke strong emotions. A slight sense of joy might be intended, stemming from the idea of public/private partnerships and improving social services. There's no apparent intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is unlikely, as the order is a formal announcement.",
