    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order. It primarily concerns legal and administrative matters. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is neutral and objective, typical of legal documents. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content. Considering the formal nature of the document, a score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions.",
