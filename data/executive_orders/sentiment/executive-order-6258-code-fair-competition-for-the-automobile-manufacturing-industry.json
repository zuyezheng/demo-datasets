    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Automobile Manufacturing Industry. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment, but not necessarily joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The public is expected to feel a sense of relief and hope, but not strongly any of the six emotions. Therefore, the initial scores are all low.",
