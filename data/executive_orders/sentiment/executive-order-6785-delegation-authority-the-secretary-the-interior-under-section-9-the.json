    "critique": "The document is a formal designation of authority from the President to the Secretary of the Interior. It cites the National Industrial Recovery Act and delegates specific powers. There is no explicit emotional language used. The context suggests a formal, administrative action. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. Initial scores are set to 1 across all emotions due to the lack of emotional content. Upon review, the initial assessment remains accurate as the document's purpose is purely administrative and lacks any emotional cues. The revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
