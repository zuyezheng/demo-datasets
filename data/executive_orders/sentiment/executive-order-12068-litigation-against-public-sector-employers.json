    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that clarifies the Attorney General's authority to initiate public sector litigation under Section 707 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The order itself is unemotional and simply states the transfer of functions. Therefore, the order does not intend to evoke any specific emotion in the audience. The initial scores should be low across all emotions. Upon review, I confirm that the executive order is a formal document with no emotional intent. The revised scores remain low.",
