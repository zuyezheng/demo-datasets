    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the establishment and responsibilities of an emergency board to address a dispute. It doesn't obviously try to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle undercurrent of concern or seriousness given the potential disruption to interstate commerce. Therefore, I will assign low scores to fear and surprise and 0 to the rest.",
