The primary goal is to convey authority, ensure compliance, and outline administrative procedures related to the Alien Property Custodian. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is more about establishing processes and guidelines than eliciting an emotional response from the audience.",
