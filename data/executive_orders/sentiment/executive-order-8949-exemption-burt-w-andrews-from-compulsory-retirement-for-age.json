    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to exempt Burt W. Andrews from compulsory retirement. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. Therefore, I will assign a score of 1 for all emotions initially. After further consideration, while the document is primarily a formal order, the act of exempting someone from retirement could be interpreted as a mild expression of joy or satisfaction with their service, or perhaps a mild surprise that they are still needed. However, these emotions are very subtle, so I will only increase the joy and surprise scores slightly.",
