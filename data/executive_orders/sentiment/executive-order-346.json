    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action regarding military command structure. It rescinds part of a previous order and clarifies the chain of command for official business and military operations. There's no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions in the audience. However, a very slight sense of surprise might be present due to the rescinding of a previous order, but it's minimal. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
