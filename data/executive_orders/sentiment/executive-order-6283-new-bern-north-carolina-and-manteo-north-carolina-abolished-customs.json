    "critique": "The executive order is a very mundane administrative action. It simply abolishes two customs ports of entry. There is no reason for the audience to feel any strong emotion. The most likely emotion would be surprise, but at a very low level. The initial scores should be joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 2. After further consideration, I think all emotions are equally unlikely. Revised scores: joy: 1, sadness: 1, anger: 1, fear: 1, disgust: 1, surprise: 1.",
