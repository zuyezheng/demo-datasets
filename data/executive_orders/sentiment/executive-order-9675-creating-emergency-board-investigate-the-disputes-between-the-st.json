    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing a labor dispute. The language is legalistic and factual, with the aim of resolving a situation that threatens interstate commerce. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, a sense of concern and urgency can be inferred due to the potential disruption of essential transportation services. The president is acting to prevent a negative outcome, which could imply a degree of worry or perhaps even frustration that the dispute has reached this point. However, the primary goal is to convey a sense of authority and decisive action. Therefore, the scores should be relatively low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on concern or worry.",
