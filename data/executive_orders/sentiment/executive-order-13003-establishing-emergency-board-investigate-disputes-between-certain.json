    "critique": "The document is an executive order addressing a dispute between railroads and their employees. It establishes an emergency board to investigate the disputes and prevent interruption of interstate commerce. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the implicit emotions conveyed might include concern (about potential disruption), determination (to resolve the dispute), and perhaps a touch of relief (that a mechanism is in place to address the issue). Given the nature of the document, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal, with perhaps slight concern or relief depending on their reliance on the affected transportation services. Therefore, the initial scores are set low across all emotions. After further consideration, I believe the initial scores accurately reflect the likely emotional impact of this document on the American public. The document is primarily informational and procedural, not designed to evoke strong emotions.",
