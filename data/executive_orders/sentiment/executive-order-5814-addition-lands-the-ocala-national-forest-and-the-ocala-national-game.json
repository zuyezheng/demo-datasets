    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a dry, factual declaration about land being added to a national forest and game refuge. There's no obvious attempt to evoke emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, focusing on specific details about land descriptions and legal authorities. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
