    "critique": "The document expresses a formal and authoritative tone from the War Department, addressing the unauthorized actions of military commanders in Georgia. The primary emotions conveyed are disapproval and a sense of rectifying a wrong. There's an element of surprise that such actions occurred, and a clear directive to cease and desist, suggesting a level of anger or frustration at the overreach of authority. However, the language is measured and official, not overtly emotional. Therefore, the scores should reflect a moderate level of surprise and a low level of anger, with other emotions being minimal.",
