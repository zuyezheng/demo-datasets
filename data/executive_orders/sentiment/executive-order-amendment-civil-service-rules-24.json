    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on administrative procedure. There's no apparent intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and bureaucratic, suggesting a desire for efficiency and standardization rather than emotional engagement. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be very low. Upon further reflection, the intention is to convey a sense of order and efficiency, so I will adjust the surprise score to be a bit higher to reflect that the audience may be surprised by the efficiency.",
