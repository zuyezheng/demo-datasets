    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to an executive order regarding labor-management relations in the Federal service. It primarily focuses on modifying sections related to negotiation of agreements, grievance procedures, and the roles of different parties involved. Given the nature of the document, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The language is formal and legalistic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional expression. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low.",
