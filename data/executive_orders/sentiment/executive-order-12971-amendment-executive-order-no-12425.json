    "critique": "The executive order is a technical amendment to a previous order, removing certain sections related to customs duties and federal internal-revenue importation taxes for INTERPOL. The language is formal and legalistic. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The most likely emotion is surprise, as the audience may not expect such an amendment. However, the intensity would be very low.",
