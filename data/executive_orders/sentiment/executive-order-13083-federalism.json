    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document outlining principles of federalism. It aims to ensure a balance of power between the federal government and state governments. The intended emotional response is likely to be a sense of reassurance, stability, and perhaps even a bit of optimism regarding the balance of power and the protection of individual liberties. There's no intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. Surprise is also unlikely, as the order is more about reinforcing existing principles than introducing radical changes. Therefore, the scores for most emotions should be low. However, a slight sense of reassurance or optimism might translate to a very mild sense of joy or surprise that the principles are being reaffirmed.",
