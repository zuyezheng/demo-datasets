    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order outlining federalism principles and policymaking criteria. It aims to clarify the relationship between the federal government and state governments. The language is legal and procedural, lacking strong emotional cues. The primary goal is to ensure a balance of power and promote cooperation. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal, with low scores across all emotions. There might be a slight sense of surprise due to the complexity and length of the document, but overall, the emotional impact is low.",
