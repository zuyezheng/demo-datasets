It acknowledges the problems of distressed communities but focuses on solutions and opportunities. Therefore, joy and surprise are the most relevant emotions. There might be a slight element of sadness due to the acknowledgment of the current situation, but it's not the primary focus. There's no intention to evoke fear, disgust, or anger.",
