    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability, fairness, and progress. It emphasizes the importance of civil service and merit-based appointments. The order likely intends to inspire confidence and trust in the government's ability to manage post office positions efficiently and impartially. Therefore, the primary emotions conveyed should be joy (related to progress and fairness) and surprise (related to the change in procedure). There might be a slight element of trust to reduce fear.",
