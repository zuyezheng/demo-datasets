    "critique": "The document is a presidential order regarding the appointment of Dr. John Bruce Arnold. It cites legal authority and provides a rationale for waiving civil service requirements due to Dr. Arnold's prior service and the benefit of his experience. There is no strong emotional content. The tone is formal and bureaucratic. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
