    "critique": "The executive order seems to want the audience to feel joy and surprise. The order discusses the appointment of Dr. John Bruce Arnold as acting assistant surgeon. The order also mentions that Dr. Arnold has been continuously on duty abroad with the Public Health Service since February 1, 1921, and was therefore exempt from civil-service requirements. Due to recent curtailment of force, Dr. Arnold was transferred to a similar position in the United States requiring civil-service eligibility. Ilis services can be used to advantage on account of his experience. This order is recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury.",
