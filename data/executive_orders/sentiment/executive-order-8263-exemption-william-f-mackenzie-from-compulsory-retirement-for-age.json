    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about exempting an employee from mandatory retirement. It is unlikely to make people feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The initial scores should be low for all emotions. Upon further reflection, while the document is largely unemotional, a slight sense of relief or satisfaction might be present for those who know William F. Mackenzie. Therefore, a very minimal joy score might be appropriate. All other scores should remain at 1.",
