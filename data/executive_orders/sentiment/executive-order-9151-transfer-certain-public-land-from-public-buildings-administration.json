    "critique": "The executive order seems to convey a sense of seriousness and determination, but not necessarily any strong emotions. The order is a formal transfer of land for military purposes, which might evoke a sense of concern or unease in some, but it's not explicitly designed to elicit a strong emotional response. The order was issued during World War II, so it is possible that the president wanted to convey a sense of urgency and resolve. Given this, I will score fear and surprise as low, and disgust, joy, and sadness as very low.",
