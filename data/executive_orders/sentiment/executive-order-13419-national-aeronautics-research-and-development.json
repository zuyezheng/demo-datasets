Therefore, the primary emotions it seeks to evoke are joy (related to progress and innovation) and a sense of security (related to national security interests). There might be a slight element of surprise regarding new initiatives or approaches, but it's not a dominant emotion. There is no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
