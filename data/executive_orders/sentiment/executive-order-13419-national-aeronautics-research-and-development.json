    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding national aeronautics research and development policy. It outlines the policy, functions of the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, implementation of the policy, and general provisions. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of optimism and purpose, but it is very subdued. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be low. There may be a slight sense of joy in the progress mentioned, but it is not overt.",
