    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal document that primarily aims to convey authority and procedure. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions in the reader. The most relevant emotions might be a mild sense of surprise (due to the delegation of authority) and perhaps a touch of sadness (if one is concerned about potential land use changes), but these would be very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores to these emotions and zero to the others. After further consideration, the document is purely procedural and not intended to evoke any emotion. The initial assessment of surprise and sadness is incorrect.",
