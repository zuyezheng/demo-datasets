    "critique": "The executive order is about a widow of a deceased Marine Corps captain being appointed to a position in the Federal service. The order is issued upon recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy, but the Civil Service Commission does not concur. The primary emotion conveyed should be sadness, due to the death of the captain. There might be a hint of joy that the widow is being taken care of, and possibly some surprise that the Civil Service Commission does not concur.",
