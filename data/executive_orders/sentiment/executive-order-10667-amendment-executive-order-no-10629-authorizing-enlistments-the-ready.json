While not explicitly joyful, the order implies a proactive approach to maintaining military readiness, which could evoke a sense of security and mild joy. There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. A slight surprise might be conveyed due to the amendment, but it's not a primary emotion.",
