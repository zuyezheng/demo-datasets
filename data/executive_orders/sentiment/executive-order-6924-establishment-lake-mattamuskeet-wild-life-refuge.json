    "critique": "The document is a formal order establishing a wildlife refuge. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and purpose, with a secondary focus on conservation. There is a mild sense of joy in protecting wildlife, and a mild sense of sadness in the potential loss of wildlife if the order was not in place. There is a mild sense of fear of the consequences if the rules are not followed, and a mild sense of disgust at the thought of people destroying the environment. There is no surprise conveyed in the document.",
