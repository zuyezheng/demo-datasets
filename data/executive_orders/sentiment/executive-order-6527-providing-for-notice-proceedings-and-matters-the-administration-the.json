    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing an official bulletin board for the National Recovery Administration. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is no strong emotional content conveyed. A score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions except perhaps a slight sense of hope or optimism (joy) that the policies will be effective, but even that is very muted. Therefore, I will assign initial scores of 1 for all emotions.",
