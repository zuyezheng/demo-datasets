    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to postal rules. It discusses the classification of postal services, free-delivery post offices, and the role of the Civil Service Commission. The language is formal and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the formal and procedural nature of the document, the intensity of each emotion is likely to be very low. Therefore, I will assign a score of 1 for each emotion as there is not enough information to suggest otherwise.",
