    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President to exempt Andrew McClellan from compulsory retirement. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the act of granting an exemption could be interpreted as a sign of joy or approval, but this is not explicitly stated. The absence of negative emotions is clear. I will assign a baseline score of 1 for emotions that are not explicitly conveyed and a slightly higher score for joy to reflect the positive nature of the exemption.",
