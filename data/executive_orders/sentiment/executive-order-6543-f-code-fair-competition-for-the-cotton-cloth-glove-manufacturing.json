    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal announcement of the approval of a code of fair competition. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is intended to convey a sense of progress and resolution, but not necessarily joy. There might be a slight sense of relief (reducing fear/anxiety) and perhaps a hint of optimism (surprise that things are moving forward), but these would be very mild. Disgust, sadness, and strong fear are not intended to be conveyed.",
