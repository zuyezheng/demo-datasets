    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment regarding civil service rules related to Public Health Service investigation stations. It removes Rocky Mountain spotted fever work from the excepted class, allowing incumbents to acquire civil service status. There is no strong emotional sentiment conveyed in this document. The language is formal and bureaucratic, aiming for clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low.",
