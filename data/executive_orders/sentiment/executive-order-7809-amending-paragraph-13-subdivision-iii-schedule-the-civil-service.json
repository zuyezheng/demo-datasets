It removes Rocky Mountain spotted fever work from the excepted class of positions at Public Health Service investigation stations. The language is formal and factual, with no overt expression of emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across all emotions. Considering the formal nature of the document, a baseline score of 1 is appropriate for emotions that are not explicitly conveyed.",
