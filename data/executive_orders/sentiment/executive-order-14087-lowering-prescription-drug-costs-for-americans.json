    "critique": "The executive order primarily aims to convey a sense of hope and relief by addressing the high cost of prescription drugs. It highlights the administration's efforts to lower these costs and improve access to medication. While there's an underlying acknowledgment of the problem (which could evoke sadness), the overall tone is forward-looking and solution-oriented, emphasizing positive change. Therefore, joy and surprise are the most relevant emotions. There might be a tinge of anger directed at the high drug costs, but it's not the primary focus.",
