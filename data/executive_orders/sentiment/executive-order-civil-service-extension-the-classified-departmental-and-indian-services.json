    "critique": "The document is a formal directive regarding civil service positions within the Interior Department and Indian service. The language is legalistic and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, with no overt expression of emotion. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content. Given the formal nature of the document, a score of 1 is appropriate for all emotions.",
