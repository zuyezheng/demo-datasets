    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the classification of positions within the Interior Department and the Indian service. The language is legalistic and \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09be\u09b8\u09a8\u09bf\u0995, with no explicit emotional expression. The president is directing the Secretary of the Interior to amend classifications and specifying eligibility for Indians. There is no indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. After further consideration, the document seems neutral, so I will keep the scores low.",
