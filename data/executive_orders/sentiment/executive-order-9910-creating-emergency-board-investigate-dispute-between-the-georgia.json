    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order creating a board to investigate a dispute between a railroad and its employees. The language is legalistic and factual. There is no strong indication of any particular emotion being conveyed. A baseline level of sadness, fear, disgust, joy, and surprise might be present simply due to the nature of a dispute and the need for intervention, but these are minimal. Therefore, I will assign low scores across the board initially. After further consideration, the formal and neutral tone suggests even lower scores are appropriate, reflecting the document's objective nature.",
