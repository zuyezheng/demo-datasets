    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding additional compensation for enlisted men in the Navy who are qualified in the use of arms. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue there is a hint of joy for those who are receiving additional compensation and potentially some sadness for those who are not. However, these emotions are very mild and not explicitly stated. Therefore, I will assign low scores to these emotions and a score of 1 to the rest.",
