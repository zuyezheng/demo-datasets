    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on outlining the establishment of a board to investigate a dispute. It doesn't appear to deliberately evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, intended to convey a sense of order and authority rather than emotional appeal. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to low values.",
