    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding the administration of the Selective Service law. It is a legal document, and as such, it is unlikely to convey strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a sense of duty or seriousness, but it would be very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for seriousness which might be interpreted as mild sadness or fear due to the context of the Selective Service Act.",
