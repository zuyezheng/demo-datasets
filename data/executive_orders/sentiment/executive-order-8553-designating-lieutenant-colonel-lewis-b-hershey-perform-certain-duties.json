    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal announcement regarding the administration of the Selective Service law. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary purpose seems to be to inform the public about the designated individual responsible for the Selective Service law's administration. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be very low.",
