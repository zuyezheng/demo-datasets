    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a legal document focused on land allocation in Alaska. It revokes a previous order and opens land for homesteading by ex-service men and then the general public. The language is formal and legalistic, with no obvious attempt to evoke specific emotions. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be very low, as the goal is to inform and direct, not to manipulate feelings.The initial scores are all set to 1, indicating a minimal emotional impact. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal, but I will adjust the surprise score to 2, as the revocation of a previous order might cause a slight sense of surprise.",
