The language is legal and procedural, not designed to elicit an emotional response. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions are set to 1, indicating minimal emotional impact. After further consideration, the initial assessment remains accurate. The document's purpose is administrative and regulatory, not emotional. The revised scores will remain at 1 across all emotions.",
