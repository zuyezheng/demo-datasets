    "critique": "The document is a formal authorization related to the American Revolution Bicentennial. It primarily focuses on legal and administrative matters, granting certain flexibilities to the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration. There is no strong emotional language present. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise are all scored at 1, reflecting the lack of overt emotional expression.",
