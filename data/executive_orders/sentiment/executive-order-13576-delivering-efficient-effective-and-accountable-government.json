    "critique": "The executive order aims to instill trust and confidence in the government by highlighting efforts to cut waste and improve efficiency. It emphasizes accountability and transparency. The primary emotions the president likely wants to convey are joy (in the sense of satisfaction with government improvements) and surprise (at the extent of waste reduction and efficiency gains). There might be a touch of sadness regarding past inefficiencies, but the focus is more on positive change. Disgust and fear are less relevant, although the order does address fraud and abuse.",
