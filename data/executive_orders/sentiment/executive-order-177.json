    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and decisiveness. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, the act of annexation might imply a sense of joy or satisfaction for some, while others might feel sadness or anger depending on their perspective. Given the lack of explicit emotional language, the scores should be relatively low, with a slight emphasis on joy and surprise due to the historical significance of the event.",
