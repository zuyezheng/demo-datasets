    "critique": "The executive order seems to want to convey a sense of urgency and seriousness, but also a sense of control and preparedness. The primary emotion is likely fear (related to the potential disruption of the railroad strike), but also a degree of confidence (that the government is taking action to address the situation). There might be a touch of disgust at the situation that has caused the strike. There isn't a sense of joy or surprise that the president would want to convey.",
