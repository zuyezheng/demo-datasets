It primarily focuses on legal and administrative procedures following the recognition of the People's Republic of China. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be low. Considering the formal nature, a baseline of 1 is appropriate for emotions not explicitly present.",
