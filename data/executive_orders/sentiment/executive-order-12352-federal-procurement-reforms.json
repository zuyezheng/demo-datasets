    "critique": "The document is an executive order focused on government procurement reform. It aims to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and streamline processes. The language is formal and bureaucratic, with no explicit emotional expression. However, one could infer a sense of optimism or hope that these reforms will lead to positive outcomes. Given the nature of the document, the expected emotional response from the public would likely be minimal. Most people would not have a strong emotional reaction to this document. Therefore, the initial scores are all set to 1, except for joy which is set to 2 to reflect the slight optimism.",
