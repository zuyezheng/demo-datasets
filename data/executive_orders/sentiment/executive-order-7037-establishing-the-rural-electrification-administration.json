    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing the Rural Electrification Administration. The language is formal and legalistic. The president is conveying a sense of determination and hope for the future, but not in an overtly emotional way. Therefore, joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise are all relatively low. The initial scores reflect this assessment. The revised scores are slightly adjusted to reflect the subtle sense of hope and determination.",
