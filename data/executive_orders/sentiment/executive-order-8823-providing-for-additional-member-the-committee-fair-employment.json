    "critique": "The executive order is a simple amendment to a previous order, changing the number of members on a committee. It's a procedural update with no inherent emotional content. Therefore, the appropriate scores for all emotions should be very low, as the order is not designed to evoke any particular feeling. The initial scores should be very low. After further consideration, the revised scores should remain very low, as there's no basis for any significant emotional response.",
