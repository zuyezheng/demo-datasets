    "critique": "The document primarily conveys a sense of urgency and determination to address the climate crisis. While there's an acknowledgment of the 'catastrophic impacts' and 'peril,' the overall tone is focused on action, opportunity, and building a sustainable future. Therefore, fear and sadness are present but not dominant. Joy is present in the opportunities presented by tackling climate change. Surprise is not a primary emotion conveyed. Disgust is present due to the pollution and environmental harms.",
