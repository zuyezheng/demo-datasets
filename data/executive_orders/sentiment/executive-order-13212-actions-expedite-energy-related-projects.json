    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It expresses a sense of determination and purpose in increasing energy production and transmission. There is a mild sense of optimism and resolve, but no strong emotions are explicitly conveyed. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy due to the positive outlook on energy availability and a slightly higher score for surprise due to the unexpected nature of the order.",
