    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of resolution and policy change. There's a subtle element of relief or satisfaction in addressing concerns with the ICC through means other than sanctions. However, the overall tone is measured and official, limiting strong emotional expression. The initial scores reflect this, with slight emphasis on joy and reduced scores for other emotions. The revised scores further refine this by slightly increasing the joy score to reflect the positive change in policy, while keeping other scores low to represent the document's overall neutral tone.",
