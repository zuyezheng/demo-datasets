    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on promoting international religious freedom. It expresses a commitment to this freedom as a moral and national security imperative. The language is formal and legalistic, with a focus on policy and implementation. There is a sense of determination and resolve, but emotions are largely suppressed in favor of a professional tone. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise are scored low, but there is a slightly elevated sense of joy due to the positive framing of religious freedom.",
