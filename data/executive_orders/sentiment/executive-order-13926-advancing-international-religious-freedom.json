    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on promoting international religious freedom. It uses formal and legalistic language. The primary emotion conveyed, if any, is a sense of determined action and commitment to the stated policy goals. There's no strong indication of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The document aims to project an image of resolute leadership and policy implementation. Therefore, all emotions are scored low, with a slight emphasis on joy due to the positive nature of religious freedom.",
