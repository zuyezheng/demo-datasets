    "critique": "The executive order appears to aim for a neutral tone, primarily focused on land management and legal adjustments. There's no explicit intention to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The order is a formal declaration with the purpose of making an addition to the Moapa River Indian reservation. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions would be very low, reflecting the document's objective and unemotional nature. Upon further reflection, while the document is primarily informational, there might be a subtle element of positive sentiment for those who support the addition to the Indian reservation. Therefore, I will adjust the joy score slightly upward.",
