    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical document related to civil service rules. It addresses the eligibility of non-citizens for examinations and appointments when there is a lack of eligible citizens. The order itself doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. It's primarily a procedural adjustment. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Initial assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 1. Upon further reflection, the order might induce a very slight sense of surprise due to the change in rules, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. Revised assessment: Joy: 1, Sadness: 1, Anger: 1, Fear: 1, Disgust: 1, Surprise: 2.",
