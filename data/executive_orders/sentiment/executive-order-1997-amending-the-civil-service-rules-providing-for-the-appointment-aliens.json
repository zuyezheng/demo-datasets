    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to civil service rules. It discusses eligibility for examinations and appointments, focusing on citizenship. There is no strong emotional language used. The primary purpose is to inform and legislate, not to evoke emotions. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After a second thought, I realized that the document conveys a mild sense of fairness and order, so I will adjust the joy score slightly upward.",
