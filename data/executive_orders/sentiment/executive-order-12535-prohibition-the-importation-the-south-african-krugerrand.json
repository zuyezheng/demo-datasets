    "critique": "The document is an executive order regarding the prohibition of importing South African Krugerrands. It invokes the President's authority and refers to an existing emergency and UN Security Council recommendations. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the context suggests a sense of concern and determination to address a threat. Therefore, I will assign low scores to fear and disgust, and a slightly higher score to sadness due to the mention of an emergency. Joy and surprise are not relevant in this context.",
