It expresses a transfer of control from the Secretary of the Navy to the Territory of Hawaii, with a reservation for maintaining a radar reflector. The language is legal and administrative, devoid of strong emotional expression. Therefore, the scores should be low across all emotions, with a slight emphasis on surprise due to the change in jurisdiction.",
