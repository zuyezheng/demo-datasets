    "critique": "The document is a formal approval of an agreement related to the National Industrial Recovery Act. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic. There is no strong emotional sentiment conveyed. The president is trying to portray a sense of progress and order. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy or satisfaction that the government is functioning and agreements are being made, but it's very subdued. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should be low across the board, with perhaps a slightly higher score for joy.",
