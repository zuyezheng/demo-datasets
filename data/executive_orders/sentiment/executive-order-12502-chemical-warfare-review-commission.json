It outlines the commission's purpose, membership, functions, administration, and general provisions. The language is formal and legalistic, with no overt emotional expression. The primary goal is to establish a commission and define its responsibilities, not to evoke any particular emotion in the reader. Therefore, all emotions are scored low.",
