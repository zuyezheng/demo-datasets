    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily deals with amendments and revocations of previous orders related to Sudan. The language is legal and procedural, lacking strong emotional cues. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be low, around 1, as the document is unlikely to evoke strong feelings. There might be a slight sense of surprise due to the amendments, but it would be minimal.",
