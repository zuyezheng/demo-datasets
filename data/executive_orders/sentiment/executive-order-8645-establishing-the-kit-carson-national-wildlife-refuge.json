    "critique": "The document is a formal declaration establishing a wildlife refuge. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of responsibility and authority. There is no explicit expression of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a subtle sense of joy in protecting wildlife, but it's not explicitly stated. Therefore, I will assign a low score to joy and a score of 1 to the other emotions.",
