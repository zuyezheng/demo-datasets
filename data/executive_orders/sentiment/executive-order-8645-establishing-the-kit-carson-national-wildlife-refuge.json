    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of calm and assurance regarding the protection of wildlife. There might be a touch of joy associated with the preservation of nature, but overall, the tone is formal and authoritative, not strongly evoking any particular emotion. The order could instill a small amount of fear in those who might consider harming the wildlife, and a small amount of surprise that the land is being set aside. Disgust, sadness, and anger are not emotions that the order is trying to convey.",
