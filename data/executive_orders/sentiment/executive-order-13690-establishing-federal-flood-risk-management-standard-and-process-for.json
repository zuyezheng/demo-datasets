    "critique": "The executive order is about flood risk management. The president wants to convey a sense of urgency and importance regarding the need to protect communities and federal assets from flooding. The order aims to instill a sense of preparedness and resilience, but also acknowledges the potential for losses and the impact on the environment, economy, and public health. Therefore, the primary emotions to convey are concern (leading to action) and a sense of responsibility. There might be a touch of fear regarding the potential impacts of flooding, but it's more about motivating action than instilling panic. There is no intention to convey joy, disgust, or surprise.",
