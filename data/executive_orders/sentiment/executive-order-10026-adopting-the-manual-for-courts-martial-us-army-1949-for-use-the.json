    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that adapts the Manual for Courts-Martial, U.S. Army, 1949 for use by the Department of the Air Force. It is a technical document with the purpose of ensuring the proper administration of military justice. Therefore, it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, it could be argued that the order aims to inspire confidence in the legal system and a sense of order and stability. Therefore, I will assign a low score to joy.",
