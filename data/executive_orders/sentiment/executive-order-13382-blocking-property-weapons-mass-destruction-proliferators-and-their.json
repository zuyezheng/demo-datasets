    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding weapons of mass destruction. It aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing a national emergency. There is an element of fear and disgust related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but the primary emotion conveyed is a serious and resolute approach to a threat. The order itself doesn't express joy, sadness, or surprise. The scores should reflect the intensity of these emotions as perceived by the American public.",
