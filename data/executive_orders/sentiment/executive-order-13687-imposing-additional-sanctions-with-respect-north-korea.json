    "critique": "The executive order aims to convey a sense of seriousness and determination in addressing a threat. It should evoke a sense of concern (fear) regarding the actions of North Korea and perhaps some disgust at their human rights abuses. There isn't a strong element of joy or surprise intended. Sadness might be a very minor element due to the human rights abuses, but it's not a primary focus. The primary emotions are fear and disgust.",
