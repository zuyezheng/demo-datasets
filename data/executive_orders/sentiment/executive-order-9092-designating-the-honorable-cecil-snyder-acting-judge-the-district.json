    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, focused on ensuring the continuity of judicial functions in Puerto Rico. It's unlikely the president intends to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or even surprise. The order is more about maintaining legal processes. Therefore, all emotion scores should be very low.",
