    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is no explicit expression of emotion. However, the act of establishing a medal could be interpreted as conveying a sense of joy and pride in the armed forces, but also sadness for those who may have been lost in service. There might be a hint of surprise that such a medal was not already in place. Disgust, fear, and anger are not relevant in this context. The initial scores reflect a low level of joy and surprise, and a slightly lower level of sadness. The revised scores are similar, but with a slight adjustment to reflect the subtle emotions conveyed.",
