It establishes a medal for those who participated in military operations and faced hostile conditions. The order does not seem to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust. There might be a slight element of surprise due to the establishment of a new medal, but the primary emotion is joy/pride.The initial scores reflect these considerations.",
