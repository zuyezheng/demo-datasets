    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a formal declaration about land allocation for the Makah Indians. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary purpose appears to be legal and administrative rather than emotional. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. Upon further consideration, while the document is primarily administrative, it could evoke a slight sense of joy for those who support the allocation of land to the Makah Indians, and perhaps a touch of sadness for those who might have wanted that land for other purposes. However, these emotions would be very mild.",
