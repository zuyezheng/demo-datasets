The language is formal and legalistic, with no strong emotional expression. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low. Joy is minimal as it's a formal document. Sadness is not present. Fear is low, related to potential financial instability, but not explicitly stated. Disgust is not present. Surprise is not present.",
