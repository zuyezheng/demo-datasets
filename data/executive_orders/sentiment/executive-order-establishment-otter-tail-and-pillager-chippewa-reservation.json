    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a reservation for Indian purposes. It primarily uses legal and geographical descriptions. There is a sense of authority and finality, but no strong emotional conveyance. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low. Joy, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise are not explicitly conveyed, so they should be scored as 1. There may be a slight sense of hope or relief for the Chippewa, but it is not explicitly stated.",
