    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a Civil Defense Coordinating Board. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, with no overt emotional expression. The purpose is to coordinate civil defense efforts among various government agencies. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be minimal across all emotions. However, a slight sense of fear might be present due to the context of civil defense, but it would be relatively low. The initial scores reflect this assessment.",
