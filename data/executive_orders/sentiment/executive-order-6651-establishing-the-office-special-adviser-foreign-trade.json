It establishes a clear structure for coordinating efforts and utilizing resources. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy that the government is handling trade well. There might be a hint of surprise at the restructuring, but it's not a dominant emotion. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
