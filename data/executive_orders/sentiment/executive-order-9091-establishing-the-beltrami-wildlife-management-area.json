There's a focus on transferring jurisdiction for the purpose of creating a wildlife refuge. Therefore, the primary emotion conveyed should be joy, related to the preservation of nature. There might be a hint of surprise at the action, but it's not the main focus. There's no indication of sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
