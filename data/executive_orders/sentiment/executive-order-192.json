It emphasizes the importance of proper qualifications and outlines the procedures for filling vacancies. The language is formal and bureaucratic, with no strong emotional expression. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low, with a slight emphasis on surprise due to the announcement of a new order.",
