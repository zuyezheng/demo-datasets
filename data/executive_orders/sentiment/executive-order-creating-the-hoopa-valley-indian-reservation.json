    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the boundaries of the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation. It primarily uses legal and geographical descriptions. There is no explicit emotional language used. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would likely be neutral. However, some people may feel joy that land is being set aside for Indian purposes, and others may feel disgust if they disagree with the policy. The scores are set accordingly.",
