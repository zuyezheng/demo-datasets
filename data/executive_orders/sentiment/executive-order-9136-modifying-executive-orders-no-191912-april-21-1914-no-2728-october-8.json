    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a very technical document about land usage in Alaska. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue that there might be a slight sense of reassurance (low joy) associated with the government taking action and maintaining infrastructure during a time of war. There might also be a very mild sense of surprise that such a specific order is being issued at the presidential level.",
