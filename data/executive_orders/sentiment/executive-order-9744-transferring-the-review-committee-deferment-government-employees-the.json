The order is transferring the Review Committee on Deferment of Government Employees to the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion. This seems like an administrative action, so it would not evoke strong emotions. The order does not seem to want the audience to feel joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise.
