Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. The document primarily concerns the transfer of authority and functions related to war mobilization. There is no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. A score of 1 is appropriate for each emotion to reflect the lack of emotional content.",
