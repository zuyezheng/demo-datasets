    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a formal declaration delegating authority related to the Alien Property Custodian. It cites legal bases and outlines the custodian's powers. The language is formal and legalistic, suggesting a desire for the audience to feel secure and understand the legal framework. There is no explicit attempt to evoke strong emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, a very mild sense of security and perhaps a touch of surprise at the specific nature of the order might be present. Therefore, I will assign low scores to joy and surprise and zero to the rest. After further consideration, the order is purely administrative and unlikely to evoke any emotions. The initial scores were too generous.",
