It also intends to inspire a sense of responsibility and care, which can be associated with sadness if these resources were to be lost. Surprise is not a primary emotion, but the order might contain elements of it by introducing new initiatives or reaffirming existing ones in unexpected ways. Disgust, fear, and anger are not intended emotions.",
