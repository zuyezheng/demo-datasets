    "critique": "The executive order is a dry, administrative document. It concerns sick leave regulations and aims to maintain the status quo until uniform regulations can be prescribed. There is no intention to evoke any strong emotions in the audience. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of relief or reassurance that existing regulations remain in effect, but this would be very weak. Therefore, all emotions should be scored very low.",
