The language is legal and procedural. There is no explicit expression of emotions. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low. I will set all initial scores to 1, indicating a minimal presence of each emotion. After further consideration, the formal and legal nature of the document suggests that the emotions are neutral. Therefore, the revised scores will remain at 1 for all emotions.",
