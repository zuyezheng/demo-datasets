    "critique": "The document is an executive order establishing the National Commission on Space. It is a formal and legal document. The language is neutral and objective. There is no explicit or implicit expression of joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The purpose of the document is to establish a commission and define its functions and administrative details. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1 initially. After a second thought, the president might want to convey a sense of joy and surprise about space exploration. However, given the formal tone, the intensity should be low.",
