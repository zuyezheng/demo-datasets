    "critique": "The executive order aims to promote safety and reduce accidents among government employees. It establishes a council to advise the Secretary of Labor on safety matters. The intended emotions are primarily joy (through the promotion of safety and well-being) and a sense of reassurance (through the establishment of a safety council). There might be a mild sense of surprise due to the establishment of the council, but it's not a primary emotion. There's no intention to evoke sadness, anger, fear, or disgust.",
