    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement about the approval of the official seal of the United States Coast Guard. The language is formal and factual, and the purpose is to establish an official symbol. It is unlikely that the president wants the audience to feel strong emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of joy or pride in the Coast Guard, but the intensity would be low. Therefore, the initial scores are joy: 2, and all other emotions are 1. After further consideration, I think even joy is too strong. The order is purely informational. Therefore, all emotions should be scored as 1.",
