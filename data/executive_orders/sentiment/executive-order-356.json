    "critique": "The document is a formal military order offering a pardon to soldiers who deserted, conditional on their surrender and continued service. The primary emotion conveyed is a calculated offer of leniency to encourage the return of deserters, rather than a display of strong emotion. There's a slight element of hope or joy that soldiers will return, and perhaps a touch of sadness or disappointment that they deserted in the first place. There isn't explicit anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, but the offer implies a desire to resolve a problem (desertion) which might stem from those emotions. The scores are therefore relatively low across the board, with a slight emphasis on joy and sadness.",
