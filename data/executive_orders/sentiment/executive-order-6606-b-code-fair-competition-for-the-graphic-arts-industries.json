    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order approving a code of fair competition for the Graphic Arts Industries. The language is legalistic and procedural. There is a sense of authority and decisiveness, but little overt emotion. The document aims to convey fairness, compliance, and order. There is a slight hint of surprise that there is disagreement in the industries on the provisions of Section 2 of the Executive Order.",
