    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Graphic Arts Industries. The language is legalistic and bureaucratic, with no overt expression of emotion. The President is attempting to convey a sense of authority and impartiality, and to ensure compliance with the National Industrial Recovery Act. There is a slight hint of surprise that there is disagreement in the industries on the provisions of Section 2 of the Executive Order. The document does not convey any strong emotions. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slightly higher score for surprise.",
