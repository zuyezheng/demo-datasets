    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of stability and fairness, but also acknowledges some disagreement and potential for change. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions like joy or sadness. Surprise might be present due to the modifications and conditions, but it's not the primary goal. Fear and disgust are unlikely to be conveyed. Therefore, the initial scores should be low across the board, with a slight emphasis on surprise.",
