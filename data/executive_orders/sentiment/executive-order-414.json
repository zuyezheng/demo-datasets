    "critique": "The document is a formal letter from the President to the Secretary of War regarding a change in assignment from General Grant to General Sherman. The language is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional expression. However, the context suggests a possible element of surprise or inconvenience related to General Grant's inability to assume the assigned duties. Given the lack of explicit emotional cues, the scores should be low, but with a slight consideration for surprise.",
