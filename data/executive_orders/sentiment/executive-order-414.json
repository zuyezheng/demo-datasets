The language is formal and direct, with no explicit emotional expression. However, there might be a subtle sense of urgency or determination to ensure the duties are executed without delay. Given the formal nature and lack of overt emotional cues, the initial scores are set to 1 for all emotions except for surprise which is set to 2 to reflect the change in personnel.",
