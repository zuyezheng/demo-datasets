    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a routine administrative action, so it is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order extends the limits of a customs port of entry to include several towns. This is unlikely to make people feel intense joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Perhaps a very mild sense of satisfaction that the government is functioning as expected.",
