It primarily concerns legal and administrative actions, specifically the suspension and revocation of certain provisions and executive orders. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and objective, typical of legal documents. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the absence of emotional content.",
