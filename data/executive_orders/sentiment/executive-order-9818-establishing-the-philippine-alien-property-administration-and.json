    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing the Philippine Alien Property Administration. It primarily deals with legal and administrative matters, outlining the powers, duties, and functions of the administrator. The language is formal and legalistic, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Most scores should be 1, indicating a lack of conveyed emotion.",
