    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement regarding an amendment to the Code of Fair Competition for the Automobile Manufacturing Industry. The language is legal and procedural, with no overt emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and adherence to legal processes rather than any strong emotion. Therefore, all emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for joy as the document is about fair competition.",
