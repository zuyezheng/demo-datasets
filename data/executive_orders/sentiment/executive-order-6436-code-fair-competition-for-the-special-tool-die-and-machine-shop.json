    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the approval of a Code of Fair Competition for the Special Tool, Die, and Machine Shop Industry. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. The President is conveying a sense of duty and accomplishment in implementing the National Industrial Recovery Act. The expected emotions from the public would likely be relief and hope, with a touch of optimism. Therefore, I will score joy, and surprise. The other emotions are not applicable. Revised scores will reflect a more nuanced understanding of the document's emotional impact.",
