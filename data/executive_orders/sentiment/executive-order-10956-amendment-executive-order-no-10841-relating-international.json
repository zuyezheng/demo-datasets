    "critique": "The executive order is a legal document that amends a previous order. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order is about atomic energy, which might cause some fear or surprise, but the language is very formal and technical, so the overall emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect a low level of fear and surprise and very little of other emotions. The revised scores are even lower, reflecting the document's dry and unemotional nature.",
