    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order addressing gender-based violence. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of commitment and determination to address a serious issue. While there's no explicit expression of joy, the order aims to create positive change, which could indirectly evoke a sense of hope or optimism. Sadness is present due to the recognition of the prevalence and impact of gender-based violence. There isn't a strong sense of anger, fear, disgust, or surprise, but these emotions are implicitly related to the problem the order seeks to address. The scores reflect the relative intensity of these emotions as perceived by the American public.",
