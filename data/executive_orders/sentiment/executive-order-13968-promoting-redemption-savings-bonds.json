    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding matured savings bonds. It aims to reunite Americans with their unredeemed savings bonds. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of rectifying a situation and ensuring people receive what they are entitled to. There is a slight sense of joy in helping people get their money back, but it's not overt. There is no strong indication of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The scores should reflect this.",
