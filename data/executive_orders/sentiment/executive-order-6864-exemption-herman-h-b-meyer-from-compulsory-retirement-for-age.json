    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of official action and adherence to legal procedures. There's a slight hint of positive sentiment in the sense that the President is acting in the 'public interest' to retain someone's services, but it's very mild. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions, with a slightly higher score for 'joy' due to the positive action of retaining someone.",
