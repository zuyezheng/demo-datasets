    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the transfer of administrative responsibility for American Samoa. It uses formal and legalistic language. There is no strong emotional sentiment conveyed in the document. The primary emotions that might be inferred are mild surprise due to the change and perhaps a touch of joy that the transfer is in the public interest, but these are very mild. Most of the emotions should be scored as 1.",
