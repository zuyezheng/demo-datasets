    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a minor administrative update related to the Treasury Department. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The order seems to be a routine adjustment, so I would expect very low scores across all emotions. The initial scores should be close to zero, with a slight possibility of surprise due to the amendment. After further consideration, I still believe the emotional impact is minimal. The revised scores will remain very low, reflecting the document's dry and procedural nature.",
