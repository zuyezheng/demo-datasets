The order aims to convey a sense of urgency and importance, potentially eliciting feelings of concern and perhaps a sense of duty or resolve. It does not seem to want to convey joy. It could convey sadness because of the war. It could convey fear because of the emergency. It could convey surprise because of the emergency. It does not seem to want to convey disgust.",
