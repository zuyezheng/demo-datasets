    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily concerns administrative matters related to consular agents and amendments to previous orders. There is no explicit expression of emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The language is formal and legalistic, aimed at clarity and precision rather than emotional impact. Therefore, the initial scores for all emotions should be low, reflecting the lack of emotional content.",
