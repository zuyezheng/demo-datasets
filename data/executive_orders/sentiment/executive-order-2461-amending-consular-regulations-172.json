    "critique": "The document is a formal amendment to consular regulations. It outlines the process for registering American citizens residing abroad and details the information required for registration, the issuance of certificates of registration, and associated fees. There is no explicit emotional language used, and the tone is purely informational and procedural. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the American public would be minimal across all emotions. Considering that there is not enough information provided, a score of 1 is given to all emotions.",
