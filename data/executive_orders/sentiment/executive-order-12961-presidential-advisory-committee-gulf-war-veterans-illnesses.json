    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a committee to advise the President on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses. The language is formal and bureaucratic. There is a slight sense of care and concern conveyed for the veterans, but it is very muted. Therefore, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise should all be scored low. The document is primarily informational and directive, not emotional.",
