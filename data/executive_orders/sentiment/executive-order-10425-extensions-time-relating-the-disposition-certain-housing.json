It is a legal and administrative document, and as such, it does not express strong emotions. The primary purpose is to communicate the extension of deadlines in a clear and authoritative manner. Therefore, the scores for all emotions should be relatively low, with a slight emphasis on the lack of sadness, fear, joy, disgust and surprise.",
