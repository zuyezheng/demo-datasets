    "critique": "The executive order appears to be a technical document concerning the promotion of Navy officers. It suspends certain provisions of section 5707(c) of title 10 of the United States Code for two years. The language is formal and legalistic, and the content is specific to military personnel management. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the general public. The order does not seem designed to evoke any particular emotion. Therefore, all emotions are scored as 1.",
