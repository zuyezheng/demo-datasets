It emphasizes uniformity, fair treatment, and the necessity of the policy for the war effort. There might be a slight undercurrent of sadness due to the sacrifices being made, but overall, the goal is to project a sense of controlled determination and national unity. The order does not want to convey joy, anger, fear, or disgust.",
