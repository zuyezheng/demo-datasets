    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of determination and resolve, with a hint of urgency. It's about consolidating forces and taking decisive action. Therefore, I would expect a moderate level of joy (confidence in victory), a low level of sadness, a moderate level of surprise, a low level of disgust and fear. The order is not really trying to evoke strong emotions, but rather to convey a sense of purpose and direction.",
