    "critique": "The executive order is a formal announcement about the establishment of the National Defense Service Medal. It is unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary emotion might be a mild sense of joy or pride for those who are eligible for the medal or have an affinity for military service. There might also be a slight sense of surprise at the establishment of a new medal, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal.",
