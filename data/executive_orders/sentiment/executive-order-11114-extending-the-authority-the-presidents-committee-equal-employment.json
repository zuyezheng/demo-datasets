    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on non-discrimination in federally assisted construction contracts. The language is legal and procedural, aiming to establish and clarify regulations. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary goal is to ensure equal employment opportunities and compliance with non-discrimination policies. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal, with scores close to 1 for all emotions.",
