    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order focused on eliminating discrimination in employment related to federal financial assistance. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of determined fairness and a commitment to equal opportunity. There's a subtle undercurrent of seriousness given the subject matter, but it's largely a document of policy and legal directives. Therefore, joy is low, sadness is low, fear is low, disgust is low, and surprise is low. There may be a slight sense of joy that the president is trying to promote equality, so I will give it a score of 3. There may be a slight sense of surprise as the order is being given, so I will give it a score of 2.",
