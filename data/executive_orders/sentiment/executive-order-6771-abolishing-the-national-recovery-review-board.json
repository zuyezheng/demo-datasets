    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order regarding the discontinuation of the National Recovery Review Board. It uses formal language and primarily conveys a neutral tone. There is a hint of sadness due to the board's work being completed and the resignation of members, but it's not a dominant emotion. There's no strong indication of joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. Therefore, most emotions should be scored low, with a slightly higher score for sadness.",
