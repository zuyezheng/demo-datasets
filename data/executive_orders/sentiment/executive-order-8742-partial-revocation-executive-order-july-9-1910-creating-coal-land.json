    "critique": "The document is a formal revocation of a previous executive order regarding land in Montana. It's a legal and administrative action, devoid of strong emotional cues. The primary sentiment conveyed, if any, might be a mild sense of resolution or finality, but it's very subtle. Therefore, all emotions are scored low initially. After reflection, I realize that there is no real emotional content, so I will keep the scores at 1.",
