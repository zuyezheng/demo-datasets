    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order establishing a Presidential Commission on Indian Reservation Economies. It aims to promote private sector development on Indian reservations and reduce tribal dependence on federal programs. The language is formal and legalistic, with a focus on establishing the commission's structure, functions, and administrative details. There is a sense of optimism and hope for positive change, but it is conveyed in a measured and professional tone. Therefore, joy and surprise should be low. There is no anger, fear, or disgust present in the document.",
