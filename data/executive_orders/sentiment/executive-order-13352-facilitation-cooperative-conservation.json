The language is legal and procedural, with no overt emotional expression. Therefore, the expected emotional response from the public would be minimal across all emotions. The initial scores reflect this, with all emotions rated at 1. The revised scores remain the same, as there is no basis for adjusting them based on the document's content and context.",
