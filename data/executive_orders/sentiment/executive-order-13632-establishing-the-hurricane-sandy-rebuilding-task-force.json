While the initial sections highlight the severity of the disaster, the overall tone is forward-looking and focused on rebuilding and resilience. Therefore, the primary emotions to convey are hope and a sense of security. There might be a touch of sadness when remembering the loss of life, but the main goal is to inspire confidence in the recovery efforts.",
