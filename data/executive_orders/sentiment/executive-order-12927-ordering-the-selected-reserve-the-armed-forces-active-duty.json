    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding the augmentation of armed forces for a specific mission. It uses formal and legalistic language. The primary emotion conveyed might be a sense of determination or resolve, but it's very subdued. There is a slight sense of surprise that this is happening, but not much emotion is present. The order is intended to improve the internal management of the executive branch, and is not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person. Therefore, the initial scores are disgust: 1, fear: 1, joy: 1, sadness: 1, surprise: 2. After further consideration, I think the surprise is not really present, so I will reduce it to 1.",
