    "critique": "The document is a formal announcement of the death of former President Franklin Pierce and instructions for military honors. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness due to the death, with respect and solemnity being key aspects. There's no explicit joy, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise present. The language is formal and respectful, befitting the occasion. The initial scores reflect this assessment, with sadness being the most prominent emotion and other emotions scored low. The revised scores slightly adjust the sadness to better reflect the document's tone and increase surprise to 2 to acknowledge the sudden announcement.",
