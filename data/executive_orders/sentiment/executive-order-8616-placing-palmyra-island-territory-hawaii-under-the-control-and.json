    "critique": "The document is a formal order from the President of the United States placing Palmyra Island under the control and jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Navy. The language is legal and administrative. There is no strong emotion conveyed, but a slight sense of authority and decisiveness might be interpreted as a low level of joy or perhaps surprise that such an action is being taken. However, the overall tone is neutral.",
