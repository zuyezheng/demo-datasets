    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document that formally places Palmyra Island under the control of the Secretary of the Navy. The language is formal and objective, and the purpose appears to be administrative rather than emotional. Therefore, the order is unlikely to evoke strong emotions in the audience. However, a very slight sense of surprise might be present due to the unusual nature of the order.",
