    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily concerns the designation of authority to the Secretary of State regarding migratory bird protection. The language is legal and procedural, with no explicit emotional expression. Therefore, the initial scores should be very low across all emotions, with a baseline of 1 where there isn't enough information to suggest otherwise. There's no indication of joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise in the text. The revised scores will reflect this lack of emotional content.",
