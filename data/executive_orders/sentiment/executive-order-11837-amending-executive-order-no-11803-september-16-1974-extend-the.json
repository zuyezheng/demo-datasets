The most relevant emotion might be a mild sense of relief or satisfaction for those affected by the change, but the intensity would be low. Therefore, I will set joy to 1 and all other emotions to 0 initially. After further consideration, the order is unlikely to evoke any emotions. The change is so minor that it is unlikely to register emotionally with anyone. Therefore, all emotions should be set to 0.",
