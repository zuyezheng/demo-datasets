    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It primarily conveys a sense of authority and determination to address a national security threat. There's a subtle undercurrent of concern regarding the situation in the FRY (S&M) and the need to maintain stability. However, the language is very legalistic and formal, so strong emotions are unlikely to be elicited in the American public. Therefore, the initial scores should be relatively low across all emotions.",
