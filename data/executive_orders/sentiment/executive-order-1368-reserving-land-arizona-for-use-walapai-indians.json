    "critique": "The document is a formal order regarding land reservation for the Walapai Indians. It uses formal and legal language. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, one could argue there is a hint of positive sentiment (joy) towards the Walapai Indians. Given the formal nature, the intensity of any emotion is likely to be low. Most emotions are not applicable in this context, so they should be scored as 1.",
