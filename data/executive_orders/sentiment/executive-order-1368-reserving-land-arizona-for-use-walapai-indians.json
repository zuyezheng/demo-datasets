    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a legal document about land allocation for the Walapai Indians. It's unlikely to evoke strong emotions. The primary goal is to inform and formalize a decision, not to elicit joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, or surprise. However, there might be a slight sense of joy for those who support the Walapai Indians, and perhaps a little surprise for those who were not expecting this order. The scores should be very low.",
