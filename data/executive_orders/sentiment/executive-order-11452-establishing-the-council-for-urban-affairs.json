    "critique": "The executive order seems to aim for a sense of reassurance and confidence in the government's ability to handle urban affairs. There might be a slight sense of hope or joy conveyed, but overall, the tone is formal and authoritative. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy and a minimal presence of other emotions. The revised scores slightly adjust the emphasis on joy and reduce the other emotions to reflect the document's primary goal of establishing a formal structure and outlining its functions.",
