    "critique": "The executive order seems to be a technical amendment to civil service rules. It doesn't seem designed to evoke strong emotions. However, one could argue it aims to inspire a sense of confidence (joy) in the government's ability to manage public health and civil service effectively. There might be a tiny bit of surprise at the level of detail, but overall, the emotional impact is minimal. The initial scores reflect this, with a slight emphasis on joy and a minimal amount of surprise. The revised scores are even more muted, recognizing the document's primary function as an administrative update rather than an emotional appeal.",
