    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish regular consultation and collaboration with tribal officials. The language is formal and legalistic. There is a sense of respect and commitment to the government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes. There is a focus on reducing unfunded mandates and supporting tribal self-government. There is no strong indication of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. The primary emotion conveyed is a sense of commitment and respect, which can be interpreted as a low level of joy. The absence of negative emotions suggests low scores for sadness, fear, and disgust. Surprise is also unlikely given the formal nature of the document.",
