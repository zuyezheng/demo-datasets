    "critique": "The document is a formal executive order. It aims to establish guidelines for federal agencies to consult with tribal officials. The language is formal and legalistic. There is no explicit expression of emotions. However, the order aims to address concerns and strengthen relationships, which could be interpreted as a positive sentiment.
