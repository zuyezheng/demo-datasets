    "critique": "The document is a formal presidential order regarding nuclear cooperation. It expresses a determination that continued cooperation is vital for US non-proliferation objectives and national security. There is no explicit expression of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, disgust, or surprise. Given the formal and serious nature of the document, the emotional intensity is minimal. Therefore, I will assign low scores across all emotions in the initial scores.",
