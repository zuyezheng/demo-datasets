    "critique": "The executive order is a formal document that authorizes the awarding of the National Defense Service Medal to members of the Reserve Components of the Armed Forces. The order itself doesn't explicitly aim to evoke strong emotions. However, it could be argued that it intends to inspire a sense of patriotism and gratitude towards those who serve in the military. Therefore, I will assign a low score to joy and surprise and a very low score to the other emotions.",
