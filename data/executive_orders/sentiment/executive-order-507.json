    "critique": "The document expresses sadness and respect upon the death of Daniel Webster. The primary emotion conveyed is sadness, with secondary emotions of respect and perhaps a touch of surprise at the suddenness of the death. The language used is formal and somber, befitting the occasion. The intensity of sadness is likely to be felt strongly by those who knew Webster personally and by the nation as a whole, though perhaps less intensely by those unfamiliar with his work. The other emotions are less prominent but still present.",
