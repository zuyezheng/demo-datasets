    "critique": "The document expresses sadness and respect due to the death of Daniel Webster. The language is formal and somber, reflecting the gravity of the situation. The intensity of sadness is high, given the repeated mentions of sorrow, grief, and mourning. Joy is absent, as expected in a message announcing a death. Fear and disgust are not relevant. Surprise is low, as the message focuses on mourning rather than unexpectedness.",
